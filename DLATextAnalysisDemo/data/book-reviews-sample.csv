5," am not quite finished with the book, but so far, I think it is very well written. It covers a topic that is difficult to talk about and is often avoided. It has been challenging for me to get through; however, I feel like I should add my perspective. I was diagnosed with cancer at 10. I am now 15 years old and a teen-age cancer survivor. I am a volunteer and advocate for pediatric cancer awareness.This book has gotten negative reviews based on several points:1) This is from another reviewer: The characters are not believable. They do not speak like teenagers. They do not even handle situations like teenagers do. So many interactions between Gus and Hazel are interactions which, plain and simple, just would not happen between real, emotional, scared, awkward, virgin teenagers, let alone ones with cancer who have been socially cut off for much of their lives.*My point-of-view: Have you spent time with any of us? They are believable as teen-age cancer patients/survivors. We may look like teen-agers, but in our heads, we are not. We have had to face our own mortality and make choices we should never have to make. It makes us grow up...quickly. Most of us do not act or speak like teen-agers because that is no longer how we think. After treatment, many of us find the things most teens (and sometimes adults) are worried about are trivial. Society cuts us off, but we are not cut off from each other. These types of interactions do happen. And, it is emotional and scary, but we learn to tell it like it is, without the normal fluff and awkwardness. We find 'normal' where we can and try to live every single day we have because we know that time is an illusion.2) The parents are not real, not deep characters, and they do not have their own identities.*My point-of-view: I have seen my own parents (and siblings) and the parents of other friends struggle with this. Many times, they do not have their own identities anymore. Every single minute is spent trying to make it to the next! They try to keep the family together and functioning, in spite of the effects of treatment, fevers and midnight trips to the emergency room, 3 weeks of the month spent in isolation, jobs in jeopardy, birthdays and holidays interrupted, not to mention talks that parents never want to have with their child. I've talked to my mom about this. This becomes their identity. My mom said their jobs become about doing whatever it takes, travelling all over the country (which is very common), researching new studies, and new medicines, all to help us survive and thrive with grace and dignity. It is also their job to prepare, if treatments don't work, to help us die with just as much grace and dignity.I hope everyone can read this with an open mind and an open heart. Then, reach out to the patients and survivors in your communities. They are wise beyond their years, funny, brave and inspiring."
2,"ve read a lot of books, but this is one of my all time favorites; that's not something I can say about very many books. I'll make it simple; I'm a fifteen year old teenage boy. When I usually read a book, I toss it aside and move on to the next one. And, like most teenage boys, I am not very emotional. At the end of this book, I cried. Not just a few tears either; I was full on bawling my eyes out. That's how good this book is. I promise you, unless you have a heart of stone, you will love this book."
5," Although his brother Hank might argue that the real fault in our stars is that our sun contains limited amounts of hydrogen, which will cause it to eventually run out of the only fuel source capable of supporting its mass against gravity, thereby expanding until its outer shell envelops our tiny planet and consumes it in a fiery death, I think it is more likely that John Green's title refers to a line from Shakespeare's Julius Caesar:The fault, dear Brutus is not in our stars, / But in ourselves, that we are underlings. Caesar (I, ii, 140-141)What does this quote mean and how does it relate to a novel about two kids dying of cancer?  I'll explore that below.The Fault in Our Stars is the story of two 16-year-olds who meet at a cancer support group.  Hazel Lancaster, the narrator, is afflicted with terminal thyroid cancer which has ravaged her lungs enough to necessitate the use of an oxygen tank wherever she goes.  It is during a support meeting that she is introduced to Augustus Waters, whose leg was claimed by a malignant bone tumor and who soon becomes the object of her affection.When I learned of the plot of this novel, I was initially a bit turned off.  I'm reminded of a comment a friend made when I asked her if she wanted to go see the movie <a class=a-link-normal href=/50-50/dp/B004QL7KKC>50/50</a>, upon which she exclaimed who wants to go see a movie about people dying of cancer?  I couldn't come up with a satisfactory response, and we settled for a two-hour movie about the competitive world of robot fighting (which still caused me to shed a tear).  So why would anyone, especially young adults, want to read about cancer kids?  As Hazel herself states in the novel, cancer books suck.  But The Fault in Our Stars isn't about cancer, and it's not about death.  Cancer is an important subject in the book, but it's not nearly as important as the characters. The disease is mainly used as a vehicle for moving along the development of Hazel and Augustus. In the absence of teen wizards, dystopian death races, and swooning vampire/werewolf feuds, it allows us to view the protagonists in a more complex setting than the traditional high school drama.  It also forces the characters to grow up much faster than they should, which I think is important for Green's audience as well as his needs as a writer.  The young adult label should not be cause for dismissal to older audiences.  As equally evident in his previous novels, Green's writing is not dumbed-down in an attempt to cater to a misguided adult notion of the intelligence of teenagers. While Hazel and Augustus certainly share in the same adolescent interests as many of their peers, their dialogue is written at a level that betrays a deeper level of maturity.  Amidst trips to the mall and countless video game sessions, the characters expound on subjects in life that everyone faces.  While it might seem strange to hear a 16-year-old use words like cloying and sobriquet, this is par for the course in a John Green novel.  And strangely, it works very well (provided you keep a dictionary handy).  Even though I initially balked at reading a young adult title (I'm well into adulthood), I realized that just because a book is marketed toward adolescents, doesn't mean it can't be enjoyed by those outside that niche.  I'm hesitant to make the comparison, but The Fault in our Stars bridges the age gap in the same vein as Salinger's <a class=a-link-normal href=/The-Catcher-in-the-Rye/dp/0316769177>The Catcher in the Rye</a>.  It contains content and themes thoroughly relatable to a young audience, while being presented in a way that adults will appreciate.Green's characters always come off a bit stiff to me and start off sounding like pretentious jerks who are trying too hard to grow up, but I always warm up to them and end up relating to them by the middle of the novel.  Gus was no exception. However my opinion of him changed as early as chapter 2, and I knew as soon as I heard him have a conversation with Hazel about their counselor's incorrect usage of the word literally (a fact that had literally been bothering me since it was mentioned in the first chapter) that I knew we could be friends.  The likeability factor of these characters is one of the reasons the rest of the story can be so heartbreaking to follow at times.  Even though I was fully aware from the beginning that Hazel's condition is terminal, she doesn't behave in a way that constantly reminds me of that fact.  Instead, her sarcastic wit and outlook on life draw me to her as someone I could easily be friends with (if only there wasn't that problem of her being a fictional character).  From very early on, I'm sucked into an emotional attachment to the characters in the story that made it very difficult to actually put the book down (and one of the reasons I will probably read it several more times).  Returning to the titular quote above, although it is fully explained in the novel, I think the line from Julius Caesar is also appropriate as a title because Hazel does not let her ultimate fate determine the course of her life.I thought Green's last two solo books, Katherines and Paper Towns, were pretty good, but they didn't capture that sense of awe I felt after finishing his first novel.  And again, I think that's because I've seen such a huge change over the years in Green's ability to connect his characters to the reader.  The Fault in our Stars returns me to that era and I'm reminded of just how good of a writer he is.  I do not know if it will win the same Young Adult Fiction awards Alaska received, but I do know it will be regarded by myself and many more as one of, if not his best work to date.  Regardless of their literary interests, I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is a fan of great writing and character-driven stories.It should also be mentioned that Green personally signed all 150,000 copies of the first printing of this novel. So if you are buying it soon after release, your copy will almost certainly be autographed.John Green's other novels include:<a class=a-link-normal href=/Looking-for-Alaska/dp/0142402516>Looking for Alaska</a> (2005)<a class=a-link-normal href=/An-Abundance-of-Katherines/dp/0142410705>An Abundance of Katherines</a> (2006)<a class=a-link-normal href=/Paper-Towns/dp/014241493X>Paper Towns</a> (2008)<a class=a-link-normal href=/Let-It-Snow-Three-Holiday-Romances/dp/0142414999>Let It Snow: Three Holiday Romances</a> (coauthored - 2010)<a class=a-link-normal href=/Will-Grayson-Will-Grayson/dp/0142418471>Will Grayson, Will Grayson</a> (coauthored - 2010)DFTBA"
5," Part one: The Book.The Fault in Our Stars is a work that defies its genre in all the best ways possible. The silly boycrushes and superficial gossip that most writers think makes up 99% of high school steps aside for a beautiful, honest, heartrending story of life, death, and love. I can only compare this book to Markus Zuzak's award-winning The Book Thief in terms of sophistication and depth.Hazel and Augustus are two of the most fleshed-out characters, particularly teenagers, that I have ever read. Their story is a joy and a privilege to read. Furthermore, their love is more real than anything else you will ever find on the Young Adult shelves.Note- Read it alone if you can. People give you weird looks when you aren't sure if you're laughing or crying.Part Two: A Response to Several ReviewsThis bit is written in response to those who find the dialogue unrealistic, particularly for wee little teenagers. To them, I'd firstly like to request that you stop being condescending. Does every teenager speak like that? No, of course not. But please don't assume that means all teenagers are incapable of using words with more than two syllables, or lack the brainpower to be witty, insightful, and existential in conversation.Having spent the last five or so years in this nebulous teenagerdom, I believe I may be qualified enough to judge the teenageriness of Green's dialogue. Do the characters sound like teenagers? No. They don't sound like iCarly, or Bella Swan, or Troy Bolton or the majority of teens in pop culture.But they do sound like me, and my best friends, and the people I surround myself with in high school. They sound like people, people I'd like to meet. Like the books defiance of the Young Adult Genre, Hazel and Augustus defy the conventional teenager model, resulting in some of the most honest and real characters I have read.Part Three: A LetterDear John Green,  Thank you.Sincerely,  A Young Adult"
5," Boy, do I have a feeling I'm going to provoke a lot of anger among the Nerdfighter community with this. All I ask is that you hear me out.I've read all of John Green's full-length, independently written novels (opting to skip all the collaborations and side projects). I find him to be a mostly charming, witty writer, but I've never obsessed over him the way his impressive legion of fans (called Nerdfighters) have. Clearly, I've enjoyed him enough to keep checking in every time he's published a new book, but there have been enough flaws or annoyances to keep me a little jaded about the experience. The Fault in Our Stars may have officially tipped the scales against Green for me. It's the first time I've really found myself irritated by a Green novel.I'm going to insert a disclaimer here before anyone tries to accuse me of lacking sensitivity for people who are terminally ill. Both of my parents have had, or still have, cancer at the time of this writing. My partner lost his mother to cancer. I also had a beloved aunt who spent the first twenty-three years of my life fighting recurrences of cancer before succumbing (in fact, I was never actually supposed to meet her, since she was given roughly six months to live upon her initial diagnosis--which was six years before I was even born). I've worn a Live Strong bracelet on my wrist every day for the last seven years to remind me of their struggles and the importance of really living every single day. Furthermore, I count <a class=a-link-normal href=/Wit-A-Play/dp/0571198775>Wit: A Play</a> among my favorite books and Terms of Endearment reduced me to emotional rubble (seriously, I can't even watch it. I cried so hard I made ludicrous, hiccupy snuffling noises that made me glad no one was there to witness it).So please believe me when I say that when I found the protagonists (Hazel Grace Lancaster and Augustus Waters) of The Fault in Our Stars irritating, it had nothing to do with their illnesses and everything to do with the way Green constructed their personalities. I'll get to my problems with the plot itself at the end.Green has an upstanding history of creating lovable nerds. He is an author who really understands and celebrates the underdog--the so-called losers of the world. It's why his fan community is known as Nerdfighters (not to mention why he has such a massive fan community at all). He's subverting the paradigm that being intelligent or weird is wrong (if Glee were capable of consistent storytelling it would be spreading the same message on TV every week). But here's the thing: in all of his other books I've believed in his over-articulate outcasts without an incredible suspension of disbelief. I don't believe in Hazel and Augustus the same way. Their dialogue is at best contrived, at worst cloying and, well, ridiculous.I chalk this down to the fact that Hazel and Augustus are worth more to Green as Metaphors than as characters. Everything they do has to be Significant and Important and Meaningful. The main plotpoint, where they embark on a quest to find the author of Hazel's favorite book (which famously lacks closure) so they can find out what happens after the last sentence, is a rather obvious metaphor for their fear of death. For goodness' sake, Hazel can't even eat breakfast without opining about how eggs are the victims of typecasting. I mean seriously, she intones, How did scrambled eggs get stuck with breakfast exclusivity? You can put bacon on a sandwich without anyone freaking out. But the moment your sandwich has an egg, boom, it's a breakfast sandwich ... I don't want to have 'breakfast for dinner' ... I want to have scrambled eggs for dinner without this ridiculous construction that a scrambled egg-inclusive meal is breakfast even when it occurs at dinnertime.* Do you get it, you guys? THE EGG IS A METAPHOR. I just blew your mind, didn't I? It's OK, take a second if you need to.Augustus is, if possible, even more obviously cratered with Metaphors. His desire to die heroically is repeatedly signified by his obsession with sacrificing his virtual life in video games instead of winning the game (then, irritatingly, Green feels the need to explain it toward the end anyway Just In Case You Missed It). He's the kind of guy who likes to keep an unlit cigarette between his lips, and will gladly explain it's metaphorical significance to you if you ask politely (You put the killing thing right between your teeth, but you don't give it the power to do its killing.), prompting Hazel to remark that he chooses his behaviors based on their metaphorical resonance and Fall Irrevocably In Love With Him.And there's the other problem I have with Augustus and Hazel: their romance feels like a plot construction far more than it feels like a natural stars-crossed Passion For The Ages. In Green's other books, I believed that Miles fell for self-destructive Alaska, I believed that Margo Roth Spiegelman captivated Quentin Jacobsen enough to make him search for her after she disappeared (in <a class=a-link-normal href=/Looking-for-Alaska/dp/0142402516>Looking for Alaska</a> and <a class=a-link-normal href=/Paper-Towns/dp/014241493X>Paper Towns</a> respectively). There was something about their force-of-nature presence that made it believable that someone like Miles or Quentin would be lured in. But Augustus Waters just shows up in Hazel's cancer support group and stares at her like Creepy McCreeperson and she just swoons at him. I'm sorry, that's almost as bad as Bella Swan falling in love with Edward Cullen even though he apparently hates her and is stalking her outside her bedroom window. Green attempts to play it cool by having Hazel recognize that she'd be creeped out if it were an ugly guy staring at her, but that doesn't make their love affair any less sudden or any less inexplicable. The plot won't work if they aren't in love, so reason be damned, and there it is: love at first sight.And that brings us to my problems with the plot itself.Observation: repeatedly beginning lines of dialogue in which your characters are supposed to make an Important Observation about Life As We All Know It with Observation: ... gets old, especially when the Observation(:) is as trite as standing in line is a form of oppression. Observation: Random Acts of Capitalization don't make your writing endearing or quirky. Please To Stop.Nevermind the fact that all the peripheral characters are completely flat (definitely an accusation I never expected to make about John Green)--if they don't matter to the author, why should they matter to us? That the plot is dully predictable is a greater offense to me. The plot twist recurrence, the acceptance of fate, the lessons learned by the protagonist at the end ... you see it all coming a mile away.The strength of The Fault in Our Stars is that it refuses to offer false comfort regarding a subject matter that does not have any happy ending: we are all going to die, but we live our lives pretending that words like forever or always have meaning (think of Isaac's subplot in re: the latter word). I suspect this is a new concept for many people; maybe that's why it resonates with so many readers. Perhaps I'm more morbid than your average person, but it was nothing new for me. And it's been done better (the aforementioned Wit for one). The Fault in Our Stars wants to have it both ways: it wants to reflect the harsh realities of impermanence and death, but it wants to leave the reader feeling good in the end. Consider that the book Hazel loves so much is lauded for remaining honest through its complete lack of closure, but Green provides us with a full denouement and conclusion. It derides cheap sentimentality, then uses it as a crutch to make the reader Feel Something. In the end you just can't have it both ways, and that's why The Fault in Our Stars is a failure to me.Grade: D+*breakfast exlusivity? WHO TALKS LIKE THAT?! You can tell me that these kids have been forced into early adulthood due to their circumstances until you're blue in the face and I won't buy it. I'm well into adulthood right now and have never heard anyone, ever, talk in such a contrived manner."
5," Reading this book will possibly be one of the most masochistic things that you will ever do. This is because it is going to cause you real, visceral pain. You are going to cry. I say this as someone who never, ever cries at books, and yet this book brought me to tears. I don't know if I will ever be able to reread this, because it affected me so deeply the first time around that I don't know if I could handle another time. I think the closer you are to the issues in the book, the more it it is going to make you feel. This might be the only place that I would say to exercise caution, because this is not a book where all the problems and sadness are neatly wrapped up by the end. It ends on an incredibly satisfying note, but it is not a happy ending, and so if your life has been closely impacted by cancer at some point then this book might be a little too close to the issue, if this book had come out a couple of years ago I think I might not have been able to read it.It's not all sadness, though. It also made me laugh out loud, and I got so incredibly invested in the characters that their futures were, for a brief time, intertwined with my own. I cared about what happened to them, on a level that most books can only hope to achieve. The prose is beautiful and incredibly intelligent, like John's other books you feel like you're learning something every time you turn the page. The characters are so witty and wonderful that I wish they really existed in my life.I was a little bit wary going in, because of all the hype and the way the Nerdfighter community tends to place John's books on such a high pestle that it's amazing he can continuously top the previous ones. This one lives up to everything, though. I think it's his best one yet, because at the heart of everything it made me feel something, and that quality is one that not many other books have been able to attain. I feel emotionally tired after reading it, and it almost seems like it made me a better person on some level.This book is going to change you. It's breathtaking and heartbreaking and desperately witty, all at the same time, and you should definitely read it. You'll come out of it a different person than when you started it."
2,"t seems like every less-than-five-star review needs to begin with the author's assurance of being a Nerdfighter and loving John Green, lest it be downvoted into oblivion. Therefore let me begin by saying that yes, I am a Nerdfighter, and I watch John Green videos religiously. However, TFIOS fell a little flat for me. Most points I want to make have already been addressed, but I still wanted to stand with my fellow three-star-ers.My main problem with the book is that the characters are just not believable. They do not speak like teenagers. They do not even handle situations like teenagers do. So many interactions between Gus and Hazel are interactions which, plain and simple, just would not happen between real, emotional, scared, awkward, virgin teenagers, let alone ones with cancer who have been socially cut off for much of their lives. Their transactions are so smooth and painless with just the barest occasional tinge of awkwardness, when most of them ought to be drenched. Augustus's flirting comes to mind as a prime example. It is funny and witty and entertaining and it is also the flirting of an experienced 25 year old. Neither character appears to be a three-dimensional relatable teenager, and that's a shame, because creating a believable teenage romance is what Green is trying to do.Neither Hazel, Augustus, Hazel's mom, or Hazel's dad appear to have their own seperate identity. They all have the same voice and thought pattern and high intelligence level as their creator does. Hazel is John Green. Augustus is John Green. Hazel's mom and dad are John Green. Isaac is John Green. (Now, I know that obviously all of an author's characters are going to reflect bits of themselves, but it shouldn't be so obvious.) Fortunately, even though all the characters are the same person, the person they are is an interesting person, which is why it's still a good book. Just not the OMGOMGBESTBOOKEVER book that the 600+ 5-star reviews imply.So, conclusion: I like John Green, I like what he brings to the arena of young adult novels. I like that he expects us to already know his references to The Great Gatsby and Kurt Vonnegut. I like that he challenges us. I like that he creates an environment within and without his novels which expects teenagers to be intelligent and demands them to be intelligent and teaches them to be intelligent. I like the fun little jokes and joyful geekery and the great thought-provoking quotes about life. But because the characters were so unbeleivable, I didn't feel any of them and I didn't care about them, because Green's own voice drowned theirs out.So that is my review of TFIOS. Not bad, not amazing either. Better than 80% of the YA novels being published right now, I'm glad that someone with talent gets to be a bestseller. But he still didn't hit it out of the park.p.s. Thumbs-downers, it is not very much in the spirit of Nerdfighteria to thumbs-down a well-written review just for disagreeing with you. This does add to the discussion and you know it. Stop forgetting to be awesome. Everyone else, DFTBA.---------------Edit: Two years and 58 comments later, I'm editing this to address the most common refrain of my most vocal critics, which is that Augustus/Hazel are smart and that I need to stop suggesting that teenagers aren't supposed to talk like that. Yeah, I have a Tumblr too. You can stop sending me links that I've already seen.Here's the thing. The problem is not that Augustus is pretentious in the beginning and that his character arc makes him become less pretentious and therefore it's intentional and okay. The problem is that the entirety of the book, from start to finish, character to character, uses overinflated, pretentious diction, regardless of who is speaking. We as readers are expected to swallow this with the excuse of stop telling teenagers how smart they can be, and any criticism is easily silenced by accusing the speaker (i.e. me) of insulting teenagers.In no circumstance did I say that teenagers are not intelligent. When I wrote this review, I was one, and I certainly did not underestimate the intelligence of my peers. The problem is that indicating that your characters are intelligent by giving them all the voice of a 30-year-old Yale English Lit major who is trying to impress a date is not great writing. It is (brace yourselves) mediocre writing that tramples and ignores and substitutes any genuine character voices with your own. As I said, it's not a bad book. It's engaging and well-written. But this is a major flaw, because the entire point of being an author is to emulate the voice of the people you are trying to portray. The romanticized, elitist diction used in Green's work is the whole date a girl who reads pretension in book form. The book is cluttered with these long, meandering introspective poem-paragraphs (not just when Augutus is speaking!) and while it is the exact reason teenagers (and adults) love it, it's also very frustrating for people who read to really connect with the characters/plot.Yeah, Hazel and Augustus are smart kids, and they've been through a lot, and they've had to grow up fast. But they've also been cut off from their peers, they are isolated in most social situations (see: airport scene), and generally othered by society because of their diseases. This kind of socialization would have a negative, not a positive, impact on a real human being's ability to interact with others. And while they are both smart, smart doesn't necessarily mean re: speaking like a Yale lit major.I really believe that while it's a good book, it's not the best book ever; it receives a healthy popularity boost from John Green's very public profile, and if he were not such a well-known pseudo-celebrity, people would read his books a little more critically."
5," had never read a John Green novel prior to reading this one. I wanted very much to like it and felt certain after reading some of the overwhelmingly positive reviews here that it would be an awesome and heartbreaking experience. I was ready and excited. I guess I could sum the experience up best by stating that it is unlikely I will read another book by this author, and if I do it will be sometime in the future when I forget how utterly disappointing I found this book to be.I had a lot of problems with this book. Overall, it felt very insincere and I was constantly distracted by how obviously everything was written with the goal of tugging on the reader's heart strings, rather than just letting things happen that were beautiful in spite of being sad. It felt like Mr. Green was screaming at me from the page 'ARE YOU SAD YET? YOU'RE SAD RIGHT? THIS IS SAD. YOU SHOULD FEEL ALL THE THINGS AND CRY ABOUT IT. I'M A GOOD WRITER. I WRITE FEELINGS. ARE YOU CRYING YET?' For a story about Human Beings, it doesn't feel very human at all. Instead everything feels very unnatural and self-conscious in the worst way.The biggest and most impossible thing for me to get around was I simply didn't believe the character of Augustus or his relationship with main character Hazel. As these concepts  are basically what the entire story hinges upon, I didn't believe in or care about anything else that happened either. Augustus came off completely pretentious and obnoxious, particularly in the way he insisted on speaking in a Diablo Cody nerd hipster sort of dialect that no one would ever use in the real world. (Some commenters here have said it's the way Mr. Green himself talks which, a.) way to be self-congratulatory, and b.) how does he not get punched in the face, like, ALL THE TIME?) His entire character felt contrived and I never once felt a connection with him. Too often it seemed like he was walking around like I AM SO CLEVER LOOK AT ME LOOK AT ME, constantly putting on a show so that nothing from him felt genuine or real. His whole fascination with ultimately meaningless metaphors felt condescending, like Mr. Green constantly squealing HEY GUYS, SEE WHAT I DID THERE? TAKE A SECOND, WRITE IT DOWN IF YOU NEED TO. YEAH, I'M DEEP. Augustus' one fault was sickness, but it was nothing that he could control. And that's just so... boring.But it wasn't just Augustus. The character of Hazel was somewhat likable, (despite Mr. Green's insistance on making her 'sound like a teenager' by formating every other statement she makes like it's a question? and tacking distracting 'or whatever's onto the end of random bits of dialogue BECAUSE THIS IS HOW TEENAGERS TALK RIGHT? I CAN TALK LIKE A TEENAGER, SEE? BECAUSE THEY SAY 'WHATEVER'. I'M A GOOD WRITER. ARE YOU FEELING THINGS YET?) but her relationship with Augustus felt completely and totally forced. There was never any real reason for them to fall in love with one another, and that is crossing dangerously close into Twilight territory. He was so convienient, so effortless for Hazel. I had to wonder, was it him or was it because he was there and ready and willing? It all fell flat and left so many places to take the stories and facets of their characters completely unexplored. Any opportunities to delve into hard questions and real answers were left untaken and exchanged for large passages (mainly in the **SPOLIER ALERT**: Amsterdam trip scenes) that had very little purpose outside of screaming LOOK AT THIS HANDSOME CHARMING BOY ISN'T HE SWEET LADIES? HE WILL PULL YOUR CHAIR OUT FOR YOU AND HE TALKS LIKE I DO. IT'S CHARMING, RIGHT? YOU ARE FEELING CHARMED. I'M A GOOD WRITER.Ultimately, it felt completely fake. I couldn't get lost in it, always fully aware of the fact that I was reading fiction and how irritating EVERYTHING about it was. I finished it, which is the only reason I gave it 2 stars, but it was a true task. Truthfully, it pissed me off. I would have loved to love this book as much as everyone else and have a new favorite to hold dear to my heart. Now I'm just confused. Was my copy broken?"
3," was on the waiting list for this book at my local library for several months. I was vaguely aware of the plot, but was more interested in reading it because of of its popularity (nearly 25,000 reviews on this site alone?!) and seemingly everyone's adoration of it. Color me intrigued!Unfortunately, the book is terrible.The characters are utter cliches. I lost interest in the whole, teenagers spew philosophical insights at every turn and act like they're middle-aged philosophy professors somewhere around season three of Dawson's Creek.The ending was obvious the instant Augustus was introduced. I am a voracious reader of many genres, and I meet characters I love, love to hate, and hate to love all the time. Even the unlikable ones often have a redeeming quality, something in their backstory that explains their present, or are just plain fun and interesting to read. I can safely say August is one of perhaps a handful of characters I've ever actively disliked. Pretentious douchebag seems an apt description, and having read profiles and interviews re: John Green, this character must be autobiographical.The plot with the reclusive author (I don't remember his name, nor do I care to) who engages in a penpal-type relationship with Augustus and trip to Amsterdam was utterly contrived and inane. A kissing scene in front of a cheering audience at the Anne Frank house/museum is not romantic; it is disrespectful and creepy.The love story -- solely based on the fact that Hazel resembles Natalie Portman's V for Vendetta era is straight out of the Nicholas Sparks handbook (terrible disease + contrived love story + impending death = $$$$$$$$$$$ and movie rights). Authors: please stop using life-threatening illness as a catalyst for terrible, lazy writing. It is insulting to people who have actually been affected by life-threatening illness.The only reason I finished this book was so I would have counterpoints to make when people inevitably act like it's on a par with Lee, Hemingway, Vonnegut, Fitzgerald, Salinger, Updike,  etc -- just a handful of the many timeless authors I strongly suggest those who rave about this book seriously consider looking into. For a more modern example, may I suggest the works of Tom Perrotta. There are many others (Rowling, King, and Irving among them) whose prose may not be Shakespeare, but at least they can construct stories/characters in which readers invest themselves. I recently read Wonder by RJ Palacio -- THERE is a book about a young person that captures the feelings, dialogue, and growing pains of a young person who has faced his own share of health-related struggles.File this one with Stephanie Meyer, whoever wrote 50 Shades of Grey, James Patterson, and Nicholas Sparks under Things I Don't Get and Wish People Would Stop Considering Literature."
2,"ve read all of Green's books. I'm a former English teacher and YA lit lover, so I was expecting great things. I ended up disappointed. The dialogue wasn't authentic; the characters were indistinguishable, and the plot was predictable. The obsession over the Van Hauten book was contrived. The book didn't suck, but it wasn't his best work either. It was just ok."
5," don't often write reviews, but I felt compelled to write a negative review of this book as I am very disappointed by it. I don't quite understand why anyone would rate this book a positive rating, unless most of the positive reviews are from teenagers who think it is a work of genius simply because of the use of big words, shallow romance, and (psuedo)-intellectualism.Given all the hype surrounding it, I expected The Fault in Our Stars to draw me in and keep me interested throughout each page, instead, the book is flat, emotionless, and unenjoyable. The characters are unrealistic and are extremely pretentious to the point of annoyance. I have never encountered a teenager who speaks the way they do -- their level of maturity and philosophical outlook is well above and beyond their years.  It sounds more like the author himself speaking through his invented characters, which explains why the main characters all sound the same and are fairly indistinguishable from one another.  Interjecting the word, like once in a while, and the overuse of the phrase, or whatever that the teenage characters repeat incessantly, does not make them seem any more believable, (It only serves to irk and further annoy).I felt nothing for Hazel or Augustus, as they were quite unlikable. Their romance occurs suddenly and without reason and is unconvincing. I also did not feel as though the struggles, pain, and suffering, that someone endures while battling a devastating illness such as cancer, were properly conveyed. It was also difficult to muster any sympathy for the characters or shed a tear for them, (their sarcastic approach to life and to their condition, didn't help in this regard). If you would like to read a better book about a young girl dying from cancer, I recommend  Before I Die, by Jenny Downham.  Although not without controversial moments, I feel like Downham's writing effectively conveys, and truly captures the essence and emotions of a dying teenage girl, and the story is much more intense and meaningful than The Fault in Our Stars, (or whatever)."
2," bought this book when I was on vacation and have read it 2.5 times since then. Every time I read it I like it less and less, to the point that I couldn't finish it the last time.To preface, I've watched John + Hank's videos for over a year and I really wanted to like this book. I haven't liked any of John's books since LfA, but I'd heard such great reviews that I thought this would be better.I think this book played on all of the faults in John's writing and this is why I disliked it. To start off, the entire tone of the book, from the narration to dialogue, came off extremely pretentious, to the point of tedium. By my third read-through I was reading several bits of the books in John's voice, because he talks exactly how he writes. Granted, Green is a 35 (?) year old man with an English major, who is very articulate and has an extensive vocabulary. he should have toned it down when writing about two awkward, teenage virgins talking to each other. I think Hazel and Augustus were both guilty of sounding like they were talking like mature, well-read adults. I also found the constant references to other literature inside the book annoying to the point of distraction, especially since it was narrated by a 17 year old girl. Between Fitzgerald, Vonnegut, Shakspeare, the poetry within the book, and the excerpts from An Imperial Affliction I felt like it really diluted the believability of the book.All of the really obvious metaphors rally detracted from the plot. The most obvious ones the come to mind were the unlit cigarette, the bones sculpture in the park, the ghettoization of breakfast foods, and how An Imperial Affliction doesn't have an ending. However, Green has separately stated that there are other metaphors hidden within the book, such as:-Hazel's name: Hazel is an in-between color, just as Hazel herself was in-between sickness and health.-Amsterdam: a city both dependent on water and drowning it in-When they are on the plane and Augustus' movie ends before Hazel's, it is foreshadowing for his death, which is before hers.I'm sure there are others I'm forgetting, but these are the few that come to mind.The choice of a girl narrator was also really distracting. I am roughly the same age as Hazel, and I felt like I couldn't relate to her at all. Obviously, I don't have cancer, but I felt like parts of her narration was really forced. Green's forte is a male voice, but I think he decided to narrate from a girl's point of view to break the pattern of his other books.Finally, I didn't really find the plot all that intriguing. Van Houten was not a very believable character. (How ironic that his characters are obsessed with finding closure to a novel, when Green himself is famous for ending his book without closure.)This is still a pretty good book, especially considering it's a YA book. I did cry the first few times I read it (in fact, I practically bawled). I wouldn't recommend this book to friends, and my favorite Green novel is still the debut, Looking for Alaska.I would love to see John write a novel about older people, even in their twenties. I think he is a good writer, but I've never been able to find any of his character very likeable or believable. John said somewhere that he is under contract to write 4 more books, which is good, because I don't think he's really found his voice as a writer yet."
1," loved this book when I started it. It instantly had my attention because it felt like it was in the same vein as It's Kind of a Funny Story and 50/50. Mind you, this is the first John Green book I've read. But for a book that seemingly seeks to kill the typical-cancer-book-stereotype, it just barely succeeds. It's not a bad book but a lot of it is ridiculously predictable. The characters are a little flat, their attempts at charm come off as pretentious and there are some situations that are just so improbable that they're annoying to read (Peter Van Houten in the second and completely unnecessary third act). I'm not bashing the book. It's a mildly interesting read that I personally find overrated."
3," was very excited to read this book, because it had been so well reviewed. I was very disappointed. I could not emotionally connect with the characters, because they were so unrealistic. Maybe it is because I have dealt with cancer and death in my own family many times that I just don't feel any depth here. Green writes about her breathing tubes and his feeding tubes and how pathetic and sad their situation is, but without actually developing any real chemistry between the leads. It feels like all of the pervasive cancer talk is an attempt at pulling your heart strings, but I feel like I might have been more emotional if more time was spent on their actual relationship as opposed to their diseases. Weak."
3," don't understand the great reviews about this book. This book felt empty and a gimmick. The protagonist obsession with that specific simple book and the trip is the biggest gimmick an author could come up with to have a story?! I felt like I was just listening to a conversation from two teenagers and that conversation abruptly ends leaving me cold, frustrated and  somewhat angry. There was nothing compelling about this story. I have read many books in English and Spanish and this is the first time I have felt this way about a book...complete emptiness and shocked that so many people fell for this story. I feel this book is for young people who have not experienced real life and real issues."
2," As a 40 year old male, I'm not ashamed to admit I like John Green's books.  In each he seems to capture the essence of adolescence that remains with us into adulthood.  In my favorite book, An Abundance of Katherines, Green expertly captures the struggles of a gifted teen in ways that speak to what it is like to be a gifted adult.It The Fault in Our Stars, Green takes on teenagers facing terminal cancer.  Hazel Grace Lancaster is a teen living on borrowed time, with lung cancer and only a short time to live.  She meets Augustin Gus Waters, a cancer survivor, at a support group and soon they fall in love.  They bond over Hazel's favorite book,  An Imperial Affliction, by the fictional Peter Van Houten.  The book tells the story of a girl with cancer and ends suddenly when the girl dies, and both Hazel and Gus long to learn what happens next.  As their romance blossoms, they conspire to meet Peter Van Houten, who lives in the Netherlands.While I cannot speak with experience, Green seems to expertly capture the feelings of children with cancer, who are strong not because of some great inner power, but because they have no other choice.  Gus and Hazel, and Gus's friend Issac all have authentic voices and relationships with their parents that feel true.  There are many times when Green, with a few lines of dialogue, brings tears to your eyes by simply detailing the words kids and parents exchange when faced with such terrible fates.Where the book falls short to me Peter Van Houten.  On the page, he never seems more than a plot device to hinge the book on.  While they help set up some wonderful sequences is Holland, the interaction with the character himself seems false, and only a way to setup the twist in the middle of the book and an ending that, without spoiling it, seems overwritten and false.Still, Green has a wonderful way of capturing the mindset of certain types of teenagers that feels timeless.  The Fault In Our Stars is worth the read.  Just bring a tissue."
1," wanted this book to be better than it was, because I truly do like John Green's writing. 3 stars is as much as I can give it, though, because when all was said and done I was left with an unsatisfied feeling.Green is a talented writer, and all of his humor and wit and biting commentary are in good form throughout this book. My main gripe was with the characters he created. I'm all for smart kids. I also understand the point of bringing across the sort of growth and emotional maturity one must come into when faced with a terminal illness. Still, these teenagers very rarely felt like teenagers.These characters often seemed overwraught and almost like caricatures of themselves. During an emergency, our protagonist Hazel dials 9-1-1 and proclaims something like, The great love of my life Augustus Waters has a malfunctioning g-tube. Really? REALLY? Moments like that brought me out of the story because it's overdone.I didn't cry but that was probably a bi-product of not feeling particularly attached to the characters. I read a lot about the love between Augustus and Hazel, but it was always flat. It seemed to just be true, because it was written that way. What's more, all of the characters in this book seemed to be copies of each other, especially in the case of the three main kids. What's the personality difference between Augustus and Hazel? What's the difference in their voice? You'd be hard pressed to find one.It's a good book with nice moments of commentary on life, death and suffering, all when it doesn't get too preachy or too overdone. Not Green's best, but still decent."
3," This is almost entirely just copy and pasted from an immediate reaction post I made on a friend's Facebook wall, and I would have written a separate review but I think there are already more than enough for everyone to see why they need to read it.I think I need to reread it; I know I sped through some parts too fast to fully appreciate them. It was...more than I expected, already, though.For a few days, I was kind of secretly anxious as hell. When I got it and actually held it in my hand, I was really excited but also afraid it wouldn't live up to the seemingly unfair hype we gave it. I mean, we didn't know that much about it anyway. He had an idea of who two of the characters were. We knew what the cover looked like. We knew it'd be autographed.We just had faith in this fantastic writer. And....it was well-placed. I laughed, I cried, I was cliche as anything. Whatever man. It was a profoundly /good/ book, and the characters were remarkable, and I can say with no hesitation that it was the best book that I have read in a very very long time, and definitely the best he has published, ever. I hope to see students studying these in English someday. And I'll be damned if it doesn't earn him the right to attach more stickers to the book covers, this time shiny and metallic and very very award-y.Buy it. It's fantastic."
3," read this because of the good ratings.  I found it poorly written, with characters unlikable and unbelievable. I was a high school counselor and  never had students who spoke in such stilted dialogue.  Plot was predictable and I never shed a tear.  I finally started speed reading the book and was happy when it was over.  If this is an example of good young adult reading then I feel sorry for the intellectual future of our youth.  Maybe all the zombies in the movies they watch have infected their brains."
5," As a book for adults to read I would give The Fault in our Stars 1 star. As a book for teenagers I would give it 3. Thus the 2 star rating I gave it for the purposes of this review. I have seen first-hand how teenagers eat this book up and I find their reaction appropriate to their intellectual and maturity levels. What I don't get are all the adults fawning over this text. My review is aimed at those readers.As someone who works every day with teenagers I could not get over the massively unrealistic speech / dialogue of the kids that this novel portrays. The brightest kids I know don't talk the way these characters do, and in this book ALL the kids talk like Aaron Sorkin writes their dialogue. As a result I kept being pulled out of the story by this distraction. Coming from the mouths of kids it is just obnoxious.The most ridiculous aspect of this book is the subplot that involves the protagonist's favorite writer, Peter Van Houten. It horribly detracts from the main plot of the text, and needed to be cut from the novel entirely. To make matters worse, some of the worst written parts of this novel deal with that subplot. Some examples include an insipid and unrealistic trip to Amsterdam that is just for lack of a better word, stupid. It involves a scene where the protagonist and her boyfriend kiss in the Anne Frank museum and onlookers clap while they kiss. No joke! It feels like a parody of bad writing. It is not helped by the fact that the character of Peter Van Houten has the most pretentious and fake sounding speech that I have come across in a book. His character wrote a novel that is the favorite of the protagonists' called An Imperial Affliction and the characters in this text quote from, and reference, it often. If the book actually existed it would be one of the more pretentious and unreadable things on the planet.Now as to why I think teenagers love this book. First, it is a very quick read. You do keep turning the pages. The topic of the text (teenagers with cancer) is an engaging idea full of dramatic possibilities. The last 80 pages or so of the book have some decent moments. Alas, they are too often followed by scenes of such sap that they quickly descend into cliché and the worse kind of sentimentality.As I said earlier, the novel's topic is a good one, and I am disappointed that Mr. Green insisted on making what could have been an interesting story into the worst kind of melodrama."
5," didn't like this book.I had never read a John Green book. I had never even cared to, until my best friend read it, liked it a lot, and recommended it to me. I should probably say that I'm not a fan of Young Adult literature (and neither is she). There are a few exceptions (The Book Thief, notably), so I was more than willing to give this book a go.As soon as I read the first chapter, I knew I wouldn't like it. I felt that Hazel was too witty, too clever to be a real person. Intelligence does not ruin a character or make them unbelievable, but she says things in a way no real person would.Worse still was Augustus. I thought Hazel was a bit unrealistic, but I liked her alright. I could not stand Augustus. Everything about him, his name, his method of speech, his looks, annoyed me. He's attractive. He has a unique name. He speaks entirely in pretty metaphors. I hated him more with every single word he spoke. I don't like to throw the label Mary Sue around at all, but I'm willing to apply it here.Everything about this book is pretentious. There's always a trite metaphor, always a poem to quote, always something that reminds me that these are characters in a book, rather than everyday people. John Green can write beautifully, but that beauty overwhelms everything, and the emotion never feels quite real.This is a shame, because clearly, John Green can write. I loved Hazel's parents (especially her father). They were very real, vulnerable, and human. Their parts of the book were the only bits that made me feel anything except annoyance.That all said, I can see how people like this book, and it certainly was not the worst book I've ever read. Still, not my cup of tea, and I won't be reading any of his other books."
2,"ve had this book recommended to me so many times from multiple people, so I thought it was about time I read it. Clearly, I don't seem to enjoy the same books that everyone else does. I always seem to be in the minority. I was excited for this, because I thought it would a unique tale. But I don't get it. I just don't. I never felt a...spark with this. I didn't finish with any lasting feelings. I thought the writing was bland and not memorable and the dialogue was awkward. Kids/teenagers do NOT talk like that. They just don't. That right there made the story extremely unbelievable for me. They talked like adults, stuck in kids bodies to make a Young Adult book. I also found the love between Augustus and Hazel to be non-existent. I felt like we were TOLD that they loved each other, but never shown. In my opinion, they never really got to know each other. I do have to say that I quite enjoyed Isaac's character. He brought a much needed element to the story. I really hate that I didn't like this book. I tried. I really did. But it just wasn't there for me."
2," went back and forth trying to decide whether to give this 2 or 3 stars. I hated the way Gus and Hazel talked like they were intellectually superior. It reminded me of the way the characters on Dawson's Creek spoke. It's annoying and unrealistic. I liked Hazel in the beginning, but began to dislike her more and more as the book progressed. The book is so highly rated and it really disappointed me. Oh well, on to the next one."
1," McDougal, the always wonderful and talented, brings us yet another great book. Completely jumping away from his earlier work of writing about mathematics, he takes his knowledge of infinities and applies it with a very clever and steady hand. Also, the wonderful twist of having another author's name on the cover is a brilliant ploy and actually a hidden code. [Check the forums to catch up on the attempts, thus far.]I would love to know if anyone can point me in the direction of his infamous McDougal Donut shirt. Everywhere I seem to look hasn't received it, and everyone I ask hasn't heard of it."
3," don't know where to begin so i will just start listing. Pretend I'm BuzzFeed and this is 26 reasons this book is overrated and over-blown teenage tripe.SPOILERS ABOUND (and I don't care).1. The character names - Hazel. Augustus (I know i am a different generation but I hear Augustus and I automatically hear Gloop and see a fat German kid going up a chocolate waterfall pipe after contaminating the chocolate river in Charlie &amp; the Chocolate factory). Issac (Mizrahi? Oh i adore him!). Who names their kids out of the Victorian age?2. Pretentious little brats too, Yeah sorry about the cancer but did it also have to make them completely insufferable? Did the cancer turn on pseudo-intellectual gobbley-gook that they have to spout every three pages before saying something teenagery so I can remind myself these are TEENS with cancer and not pedantic adults who have been locked in an ivory tower called the Filosoof reading Spinoza?.3. Speaking of the Dutch, clever marketing ploy - author gets time in the Netherlands to write. He writes a big part of the book set in the Netherlands. It's like a Dutch tourist ad. And make sure you make it to the Anne Frank house because every teenager with cancer wants to make out there.4. Let's face it there is nothing that gets your disease ridden hormones going as much as other teenagers cut down in the prime of their life by Nazi's at a concentration camp, so like totally, add that in and make it a big make-out scene cuz that's super hot.5. Speaking of hot, that's totally Augustus Waters. OMG like fer sure. He's like um totally hot. See - this really is about a teenage girl with cancer because look how she talks about a totally hot guy.6. I pray that no teenager with actual cancer has read this book. I am grateful that the poor tragic girl who inspired John Green to write this drivel never had to suffer through reading it knowing that her short life of suffering was co-opted into a book not even as good as some Lifetime movies I've seen.7. She was a real person (Esther Earl) like Anne Frank was a real person and how dare John Green use them to write his simpering teen tragi-porn! it's beyond revolting! He could not even in death give them the dignity they were due but use them shamelessly for his YA ends.8. How much for the movie rights John? How many other teenage blather books will you write? Isn't it fab that these teenagers suffered and died and you got to write a book and make a ton of money and become famous?9. But seriously, if the book had been better, if the love story had not been so shallow and manufactured and utterly meaningless (yes, I know that's how things can be with teenagers but dying teenagers?) Oh sorry there isn't enough time so um, yeah hi Hazel Grace you look like Natalie Portman how about I give you my make-a-wish wish and we go to Amsterdam and meet this raging loon alcoholic that wrote an insufferable pretentious young girl dies of cancer book that you happen to love (and me too because i love you) and  then while we are there (but after i get laid woo-hoo buh-bye virginity) I'll tell you surprise - i know you have fallen in love with me but my cancer has come back and I'm gonna die - even before you do!10. Oh and that guy Issac he's totally blind and had both eyes cut out of his head. So to pay back his girlfriend (when he had one eye but she was down with that) for dumping him he eggs her car. Blind. Yes, eggs her car. Because, ya know - teenagers! Even with cancer they are incorrigible!11. Anyway the language of these philosophical, brooding, deeply feeling video game playing teens is unlike any teenagers I have ever heard speak in my life. As other reviewers have commented, they all sound like John Green. They all are John Green. This entire book, though inspired by real-life teenagers who suffered and died from cancer, is at the beginning, middle and end, all about John Green. Thus it is as swaggeringly faux-nerdy as he is in his Mental Floss videos on You Tube.12. But more so really, because this took time, energy, research. This is something he had to purposefully write and think he was doing something considerably important. Give him the key to the city!13. Well they probably will in Amsterdam but then they are all high there so like, whatever, man.14. Only about 1 percent of all cancer patients are actually teenagers. So this book is not really for them, it's for all the teens who don't have cancer so they can cry over the teens in love in the book who do and they can feel better about their crap lives thinking - well at least I don't have cancer like Hazel and Augustus and Issac. At least i don't have to look at my parents and say, Not if but when I die like Hazel says to her parents.15. This books is so in love with itself, so in love with its existential philosophy and preening cleverness that it often forgets that its audience won't be looking for much of a challenge and then has to try to float something arty and smarty down upon them so the author feels that he has contributed in some way to fostering an intellectual treatise, with a dose of blubbering emotion (enough to make you puke).16. Furthermore all the quirky stuff - dear Lord all mighty - especially Augustus Waters not smoking the cigarette, how could anyone (hello Editor) think this was a good idea? Or the swingset? The needlepoint homilies at the Waters house? The light-hearted banter the two families had with their dying children - awww, lemonade out of those cancer lemons! Hazel's bitterness and how they overly down-played the blindness of Issac, are you kidding me? When you get cancer that lets you just be a total creep to other kids with cancer and mock them after they are blind? Yeah, that's cool, shows us how quirky they are. And the dumb letter at the end to the drunk author - was i supposed to choke up there?Um, like, whatever.Lest you think I am heartless i will offer my personal bias. My husband died of cancer six years ago. Fortunately he did not suffer long but the suffering he did in ten days was cataclysmic. There was nothing romantic about it. He was narcotized for pretty much all but several instances. And then he was dead and gone from my life leaving devastation and despair and me a widow in my thirties. Trying to turn the horror that it was into anything but the horror that it was would be criminal.John Green should consider himself lucky that it wasn't his person who died of cancer. Because that would be a very, very different book."
5," What can I say? Holt McDougal never fails to please! I read his autobiography, Searching for McDougal and knew that I had to take a look at this novel. I'm glad I did!Though I am not a young adult, I can relate to many of the themes in this novel, probably because I am a human being. My favorite moment is when Holt's main character, Scarlet, tells her lover, No, James. The Hanklerfish was my first. Zing!If you're not familiar with Holt's previous work, you can find it on his online store here on Amazon. I must say, it's clear that he's been heavily influenced by John Green. Actually, I'd venture to say that Holt and John write like they're practically the same author. Probably why Holt put John's name on the cover of this book; clearly a shout-out. You're a humble one, McDougal!If I had to rate this book on a scale from 1 to 10, I'd rate it a 12, but Amazon forced me into a 5-star scale (with no allowance for extra stars). There should be a 6th star classified as a rating of Holt, and a seventh star defined as Awesome. Ironically, this beauty would fall into the Awesome category, surpassing Holt's own rating. I have no idea what I'm saying. Bravo, Holt! DFTBA."
1," have been a fan of Green's novels since I read Looking for Alaska when I was 19, and had just graduated from high school the year before. Then I read An Abundance of Katherines (my favorite novel of his) and have since watched his videos and read every book he has written, including short stories and collaborations with other authors. Of course I was excited for this book and preordered a copy so I could finally have a book signed by him. Unfortunately, it did not live up to my expectations. I feel like the older I get (I am now 25), the less I can believe Green's writing. I used to love the dialogue in his books but it has progressively gotten more and more obscure and less realistic. I understand style, I am educated and have of course taken many lit classes when I was in college, but he took a few too many liberties in this novel. I just couldn't believe in much of any of the conversations between Hazel and Augustus, I really didn't like the smoking as a metaphor. There were just too many things that were unrealistic. It is unfortunate because I wanted to love this book for so many reasons: my own health battles with my thyroid, my experience in high school when I lived in the Netherlands and traveled many times to Amsterdamm with my friends...there were so many things that I should have been able to relate to, but unfortunately I could not."
5," understand this is fiction but most fiction in this genre is realistic and believeable.  The characters here are pretentious and unlikeable and definitely do not act like  teenagers (or anyone for that matter) stricken with cancer.  I realize this isn't a story about cancer but if the author wants to include that as part of the storyline, he should at least show cancer in its true light.  Three of my four children are cancer survivors so that may influence my feelings regarding this book.  To show these characters traveling around the world, dancing, drinking etc. - where does that energy come from when you're full of chemo drugs and cancer cells?  Anyway, I'm sure many readers will enjoy it - I don't think many cancer patients or their loved ones will find it entertaining."
3," After reading all the wonderful reviews on amazon.com (amazon.com customers never lead me wrong), I was anxiously awaiting the arrival of this book. I wish I hadn't set my expectations so high. It seems as though the author was trying too hard to make the reader sympathize with the characters. I understand the characters are young adults dealing with medicial conditions that an every day Joe cannot even begin to fathom, but I was never able to truly feel the characters and their emotions. I didn't feel engrossed in the book and I was never able to feel like I was living in the characters world - they always felt distant. I love it when books make me feel like I've left the present time and place I'm in and am now living in the world created by the author. That's the mark of a great book.Maybe it was just me, but I would not recommend this book. Easily forgotten......"
1," This is it.This is the kind of title that probably pops up if you rated Twilight with 5 stars.If thats you thing, whatever floats your boat.I personally found this to be the most overrated story I've ever had the misfortune to read.The kind of book you hear so much hype over and actually look forward to and the author actually looks like a decent human being and then you start reading and its like that sinking feeling you got when you sat and watched The Phantom Menace for the first time in the theater- you keep telling yourself it can't possibly be as bad as your brain is telling you but soon you're overtaken completely by that hollow ache of hope dying  - slowly then all at once."
5," Remember that episode of Seinfeld in which Elaine was ostracized for hating The English Patient?  That's me with this book.  I can understand why some people would love it.  When I first heard the premise, I was like, Two teens with cancer, at least one terminal?  No way! Then some people I respect raved about the book so I decided to give it a try.  It's not so much the teens-dying part that I hate.  It's the pretentious way the characters speak.  If I could go back &amp; rewrite some scenes from my teen-age years with the wisdom &amp; experience I have now, maybe I might sound like the two protagonists.  Then again, I doubt it because I'm not that arrogant."
2," To be considered a good book, all characters have to at least be distinct and believable. The Fault in Our Stars doesn't even meet this most basic requirement. The characters in this book all talk the same way and think the same way. Hazel, the main character, her boyfriend Augustus, the messed-up writer, etc; you cannot tell them apart from their conversation. They are basically the same person: the author John Green. I was extremely disappointed. Don't believe the rave reviews."
2," read the book because of the many mentions I'd seen in Top 10 lists and the high reviews on Amazon.  I have to say I thought it was just ok.  The main characters of Hazel and Augustus came across as characters written by an adult male, which they were.  The believability factor of the way the characters were written just seemed off.  It came across like an 80's movie where the teenagers are geniuses and the adults are one-dimensional Simpletons.  The ever-present looming death of the main characters hung on each page to the point that you became numb to the emotions it was supposed to invoke.  I'm happy that so many others were moved and loved the book so much, but for me, it disingenuously tried too hard."
1," had high hopes for this book given the media praise and the Amazon reviews. The story line had me instantly hooked. Then came the pretentious dialogue, which would have been cloyingly obnoxious in adults. But in adolescents (I have two) it completely distracted me from an otherwise great premise. The two protagonists seemed to constantly want to one-up each other with their clever witticisms, literary allusions and world insights. It got so bad I quit reading. Really too bad given the importance of the topic and the track record of the author."
3," This book is like Paul Rudd. I see the appeal, and I would never take it away from anyone. But I would also never stand in line for it."
2," really loved this book.  Holt McDougal is a very talented writer.  One could say that this book is very John Green-esque.  Seriously, if you like John Green, this Holt McDougal is the next best thing."
2," ...but that's a John Green novel for you.  I was only 7 percent through the book, according to Kinderella (my Kindle) and had to stop immediately and do my dishes, or I knew I would be sitting there all night.  I was also moved to send John Green an e-mail immediately, telling him how brilliant his writing is and how much I learn from reading his books. (I am a 48-year-old woman, a YA-author-in-progress, who reads everything, but has a special love for good YA fiction.)I loved Hazel and Augustus pretty much immediately, and the book (which I picked up again after doing my dishes and proceeded to read until I was finished) took my emotions on a journey as wild and unexpected as Augustus and Hazel's.  One thing I love about John Green's books is how they can't be characterized.  His books are always so much more than the sum of their parts.  My husband asked me what the book was about, and all I could respond was, Everything.That being said, I did not give the book 5 stars, only because I felt - with all due respect - that it lost track a bit in both tone and momentum towards the end, when the plot grew a bit more contrived than I've come to expect from Green.  I only give 5 stars to books that leave me feeling like, This was the best book I've EVER read! even for a little while.  I didn't feel that way, but I did feel like I'd been on the rollercoaster with Hazel and Augustus, and I was left pretty much a red-faced, snot-nosed mess.I adored some of the secondary characters as well, such as Isaac and Hazel's parents, and even the walk-on character of the waiter at the fancy Dutch restaurant.  Drinking champagne will forever be all the sweeter because of him!I've read quite a few excellent books about living and dying this past year, but none have made me think and feel as much about both as The Fault in Our Stars."
5," was hesitant picking up Mr. McDougal's The Fault in Our Stars as I am not a big reader of Young Adult Fiction. However, I read his first work, Looking for McLaska when I was younger, and I couldn't resist The Fault in Our Stars. TFiOS (as the members of McDougal's internet McCult call it) is a tremendous McCess. I really McDug it. Holt McDougal is truly one of the greatest Young Adult Fiction authors of our time. Remember that name, Holt McDougal. You're going to be hearing it for years to come."
4," should probably start out by saying this is the first John Green book I have ever read, and I went into it with high expectations because of how many good reviews I've seen for his novels. That being said, I was very underwhelmed.First off, I felt the characters were boring, and rather unbelievable. Let's start off with, Hazel the main character. She's a cancer patient....that's it. There's really nothing else interesting about her: she has cancer, she likes to read, she falls in love, that's her whole character. Next we have the romantic interest, Augustus Waters. His name bothered me from the very beginning, it just sounds very...fake. I know that sounds overly critical, but still. His whole attractiveness felt very forced, and cliche. In the beginning he's just too perfect to be believeable. Plus, there was no build up between them. Their meeting was so rushed it was almost non-existent. I get that it's a short book, and you can't take a whole chapter to do everything, but it literally felt like one minute they are complete strangers and the next minute they are semi-dating.Also I found the wording to be a little on the pretentious side for a teen romance novel. Quite frankly, I'm not sure who the audience for this book is. The plot is a basic, sappy teen romance type plot, while the wording and references are something you'd expect to be aimed at young adults, maybe college students. I guess what I'm trying to say is, when I read this I couldn't help but feel like this is one of those books that kids in 9th grade read to feel sophisticated or mature. They tell all their friends how deep it is, when it really isn't. It only appears deep on the surface.Anyway, in my opinion the only redeeming quality about this book is that once in a while something sad happens, and I have this weird masochistic thing where I like things that can make me cry. And I did cry maybe 2-3 times through out this book. However, I just can't in good faith recommend this to anyone, unless like I said, you are a 9th grader who likes to feel deep. In which case, you go little hipster kid."
5,"n The Fault in Our Stars, author John Green tackles the major questions of existence with humor, honesty, and grace.  The narrator (Hazel) is dealing with a terminal form of cancer and yet this is not a story about dying but rather a story about truly living.  Through the lives of the two main characters Green shows us that we are all in fact terminal, but that we largely decide how to spend our brief moments of life.  Most lives are not triumphs or tragedies purely, but they are filled with moments of both.I would heartily recommend this novel to a wide audience far beyond the Young Adult crowd.  Personally, I became aware of Green through his YouTube efforts and eagerly awaited this book.  My only regret is that I read it at one sitting, but I simply could not put it down.  A masterful, coming-of-age story.  Wonderful and poignant.  Laughter and tears.  I will definitely be passing this book on to the readers in my life."
5," first found out about John Green on youtube and was immediately drawn to his witty personality and humor. I found out later that he was also a published author and knowing this made me really want to read one of his novels. I chose The Fault in Our Stars because it happened to be the book he was about to release at the time and I was really excited to read it and excepted to love it, but it was so lackluster and at best mediocre.The story is lame and the characters are pretentious.  Hazel and Augustus are two very unlikable characters that I didn't even feel sorry about them having cancer. There are also some parts that are lame and even though they're small occurrences I couldn't help but linger over them in anger and complete disbelief that anyone could write this awful. One part is when Hazel returns back home from Amsterdam and her father is waiting for her at the airport and he holds up a sign that reads My beautiful family. He does this among a group of limo drivers that are also there holding signs with names of the people they're going to pick up. If I was a working limo driver that had to demean myself by holding up a sign I would be offended by the guy who was just doing it for fun.  Another part is when Augustus collapses in front of Hazel and she calls 9-1-1 and says to the dispatcher, We need an ambulance! The great love of my life has a malfunctioning G-tube! NO ONE CARES IF HE's the GREAT LOVE OF YOUR LIFE! Just state your emergency and that's it!I really don't understand why people cried when they read this book. There is absolutely nothing to cry about.  Their love story is lust at first sight. Hazel thinks Augustus is hot and he thinks she's hot because she looks like Natalie Portman. However, the thing that bothered me the most was how unrealistic and unusual the dialogue was between Hazel and Augustus. The things they would say and the words they would use were far too intelligent and philosophical to come out of a teenager’s mouth. I’m sorry but I’m sure having cancer doesn’t make you wise beyond your years. Sometimes the dialogue felt like Green was trying so hard to seem all knowing and it just came off as arrogant. Then I started thinking that the character’s rants sounded familiar, and then it finally hit me! John Green’s rants in the book are worded the same as his rants on youtube.  He is literally Hazel and Augustus. He put so much of his own personality into the characters that there is no separation between author and character.I really wanted to like this book but after reading it I finally came to the realization that John Green and his books are way overrated and not worth my time. He even has the audacity to openly mock and harshly critique Stephanie Meyer's Twilight series and writing style when in reality he writes at the same level and created a story no better than hers. I've stopped watching his youtube videos and will not continue with any more of his books."
2," am not an emotional reader. Hallmark commercials, Disney movies, beautiful songs, but books never really have that effect on me. I read them, I think about them for a few days, and then I let them go. I've never been swept up into the world of a book enough that I feel the triumphs and tribulations of the characters.Until this book.I can't accurately describe the life this book has taken inside of me. I read it through Thursday night, staying up hours later than I should have; I woke up three times in the night, heart racing, caught in the emotional impact of the book; I thought about it all through my Friday morning errands and class; I listened to the audiobook (though not in its entirety) when I returned home. Two days later, I am still having a emotional reaction to parts of the book, sometimes out of the blue. I feel like there are these long-reaching aftershocks, and every time, they twist my belly into knots.Green stated that he'd sought to write an epic in miniature. I cannot think of a better term for this book. It's unlike his others, it's unlike anything I've read, and I am not sure I can carefully set it in one category or another. It is beautiful, it is haunting, it is funny and tragic and overwhelming.If you are a nerdfighter or simply heard of the hype surrounding this book, believe it with a grain of salt. Believe it with a voice in the back of your head telling you to be cautious. Because the first two chapters we've all heard are nothing like the remaining 23. And all 25 are nothing like Green's other books, but in the best and most wonderful way. I feel like this is the writer Green was meant to be, the one we've all expected to emerge since Looking for Alaska.Entertainment Weekly picked luminous as their descriptor, but I would disagree.My word is resonant, and I am still feeling the afterglow."
1," Holt McDougal has always been one of my favorite authors. I pre-ordered his latest novel to get the much-revered McDougal signature on the inside cover - what we in the know crowd like to call the M-scribble - and I was very pleased. Personally, I can't wait to see what Holt McDougal does next - I'm sure it will capture the hearts of many just as this novel has."
5," Holt McDougal is a name that will be remembered for years to come. Holt is one of the most versatile authors of our time--- in addition to writing your ordinary calculus and astronomy textbooks, he also dabbles in young adult fiction. He's been wildly successful in both genres (can i say his algebra 2 textbook was especially fascinating.) Next time you're looking for a good book, remember the name Holt McDougal. You won't be disappointed. DFTBA everybody"
5," TFIOS is a hard book to review. It's very well liked and on every Best Of list there is. I can see and understand why but I'll stand over here in the Unpopular Opinion Isle feeling underwhelmed and disappointed. I'll admit the first time I read it when it came out, I fell for the hype. It wasn't until the second reading did it hit me what this book actually tried to accomplish. I should have left it alone after the first time, and now I'm left cold and kind of mad.There is a good reason why the words pretentious, contrived and trite float around on the negative side of reviews for this book - none of these people, excuse me, CHARACTERS felt natural and real.John Green is a fabulous writer. His prose is beautiful, clear and imaginative. Some of the quotes and thoughts in this book hit close home and I giggled and smiled because it brought on some interesting memories and personal quirks of mine. His characters are usually the oddballs, the nerds and losers rising above the stereotype into the shining stars. But Hazel and Augustus did not do it for me one bit. They are sort of empty shells without personality and the only way to make them interesting was to rush them into romance, provide something sad (cancer) and have them quote ton of deep stuff which was so repetitive I skipped many pages. It's the excessive beauty of his prose that completely takes away any realness from the story and the characters themselves. Nothing about them felt natural. Their interactions were nothing but series of pretentious poems, references to indie bands, some quote about something COSMIC and DEEP, books and authors I've never even heard about. John Green is a smart, well articulated ADULT without a doubt. But he tried to translate his intellectualism onto these cancer struck teenagers so hard, they both came off so unreal and corny, I felt no connection to them. Teenagers are NOT 40 year old men, John. The illness is only there to cause an emotional reaction because otherwise you'd be stuck with two HOT, nerd hipsters with NO romantic chemistry and forced into a love story that fell flat. Gus's I'm in love with you speech on the plane made me roll my eyes. 17 year olds DO NOT TALK LIKE THAT. I hate being manipulated and that's what this book did."
5," have to admit, even though I'd heard this book was really good, the thought of a young adult novel about teenagers with cancer didn't hugely appeal to me.  My initial reactions were also somewhat less than stellar - everyone talks in a razor-sharp, ultra witty way that feels straight out of an Aaron Sorkin or Diablo Cody movie and not even remotely how any 16 or 17 year old I know speaks.  I feared that it was going to be all style without substance, bouncing along until a requisite tearjearking conclusion.I was wrong.This is a book peopled with a group of characters that you really care about.  At its core are the star-crossed lovers, Hazel (with terminal cancer) and Augustus (a cancer survivor).  They meet at a cancer support group and become close, despite Hazel's desire to avoid becoming a grenade in anybody's life - by which she means someone who will unwittingly cause significant hurt through their passing.  They are fantastically loveable characters, who flit between deep conversations about the meaning of life and finding refuge in video games and reality TV shows.  I loved them both.  Still do.But the book is more than that.  It's about coming to terms with the fact that your life will almost certainly never rise above insignificance - yes, you will matter to your family and friends, hey maybe even write a few reviews that people like on Amazon, but ultimately you probably won't make any life changing impact on the world.  It's about the way we shrink from people with terminal disease only to laud them when they pass.  It's about the impact that terminal diseases have on the families of those left behind.  It's about teenagers growing up and learning to take responsibility for their own lives, defining themselves by who they are not what disease they may have.I don't know if there's anything life changing here, but it's definitely a moving, entertaining and thought provoking book.  Pretty hard combination to pull off.  Kudos to John Green."
2," Holt McDougal, a man who swept into the YA scene with the grace and humble nature of fishing boat proceeding into the marina. Instead of the ocean's bounty, McDougal once again brings us a hefty number of pearls, insight into the true nature of life and as death. My favourite line, and one I'm sure I'll quote to my children for years to come was, I believe the lasagna wants to be noticed. I think that all pasta-based meals are inherently biased toward the consciousness, and it is a miracle of your mother's cooking that her food may possess some form of sentience. And who am I, a mere human, to tell this lasagna that may or may not be smart enough to run for Congress, that it-or my observation of it-is temporary?”I said this to boss the other day, and he replied, Well, Burt, that's nice and all, but if you're going to tell me the lasagna has no edge I'll take a middle piece. And then he gave me a promotion, because that is the kind of inspiration and recognition the fans of Holt McDougal instill in others after partaking in his wisdom."
4," Wow. Truly, you would think a book review that begins with such an exclamation would reflect how amazing it was. Prepare to be disappointed. I'm a 16 year old girl and considering that I'm within the target audience, found it pathetic and lacking. The entire book is, essentially, a failed attempt to inspire some kind of profound emotional realization that could change a life. I literally cannot put more emphasis on the word failed. If you're into irritating banter, meaningless motifs and mantras, shallow characters and false emotions, this is the book for you. Extremely overrated.I am completely appalled and find that this sort of literature should be below John Green.The Fault in Our Stars had me wondering if I should throw this book into the dark abyss of the ocean and watch it sink into a pit from which it could never surface. Slowly, and then all at once."
5," did not enjoy this book.  I did not find it life affirming like many reviews have stated.  I found this book to simply be depressing as hell.Don't get me wrong, I don't need a book to be all roses and sunshine for it to be worth reading....but there needs to be a little light.Besides that, I just didn't find any of the characters in the books to be very realistic (except for Hazel's dad).  The teens are all way to wise beyond their years and far too witty.  That's just always a turn off for me.  The author of Hazel's favorite book (I probably should have looked it up) also rang incredibly false to me. Sure he's a drunk....but I just refuse to believe he'd actually be THAT repugnant.Also, being a gamer, it's a pet peeve of mine when games are presented in an overly phony way....and they never did explain how a blind kid could play.Anyway, it just didn't hold any value for me.  I wish it had."
1," A friend suggested that I read this book so I bought it without reading the summary or any reviews. When I got the book I was excited to start reading. Overall I hated the book. It was not well written, the characters were not well developed, the plot line was awful, etc. I felt like this was not a book that Young Adults should be reading. It is more of a tween book, and even an awful one at that."
5," The reviews of this novel are almost consistently 5 stars. I hadn't been able to find a book that threw me off my feet in a while, and I had all my hope in The Fault in our Stars.Hazel Grace and August Waters were cute, and their relationship and the way the dealt with their illnesses was admirable. However, I lacked to see why this book was different from any other books about kids dying of cancer.The writing style was great, but there was something missing for me. I wanted to love this book. But I didn't."
2," have never seen such a high rating for a book with so many reviews, that is why I read it.  I question whether the fact that the movie is coming out affected the number of 5-star reviews.  Kudos to the publicist. This book was odd.  I kept reading because I expected some type of amazing enlightenment to strike me.  But no, it was banal, predictable and anticlimactic.  I'm glad I borrowed the kindle version from the library.  I would have been frustrated if I fell for the advertising for this one and actually paid for it.  I hope Mr. Green at least donated a good portion of his profits, for both the book and the movie, to the organization started by the family of the girl who inspired this story.  Otherwise he just made money off of someone else's tragedy.  If you have done so Mr. Green, I commend you.  As for the story, it was sad, but nothing compelling about it."
3," The book is crap, John Green is crap, and the obnoxious romanticization of illness and the completely painful faux profundity makes it unreadable. It's astounding that this has received critical acclaim and ultimately it's awful and something you shouldn't read."
1," Seriously okay so they made a movie out of this book. BIG DEAL The plot is terribly drab and depressing. I don't know any teenagers who act like the ones in this book and I KNOW a lot of teenagers. The writing was subpar and the use of large complicated words didn't make the story better but made it worse. In spite of my vast knowledge of words and their definitions (I am not a scholar by any means but I do read a lot) I still found myself shaking my head and wondering why he would use certain words where he did. It's hard to express my displeasure with the book as a whole without giving away any spoilers.The flow of the story and the timeline were also another reason I didn't like this book. If my child who has cancer and is socially awkward met a boy in a support group for other people who have cancer I would be happy that she found a friend. I would not however allow her to head over to this boys house without first meeting him, his parents, every teacher he had ever had, his youth pastor, his pastor and ask for character references from all his friends and the pope. Okay so I'm being a bit dramatic here but you get my point. I'm not going to let my daughter just hop in the car alone and go see a boy she doesn't know and has only met once. Then the rapid pace at which they fall in love. It's not unbelievable considering my own love story but I can't for one moment believe that these two fell in love in the hour they stared each other down in the literal heart of Jesus.There were other things that just didn't fly with me throughout the story but once again I would be spoiling it for those of you who are actually reading this review but would no doubt have me tied to the stake and set on fire if I were to give you a spoiler even if I attached a spoiler alert warning in my own blood.For me it was Ehh....Sure it tugged on my heart strings a bit but seriously if you can read a book about kids with cancer and you don't get your heart a little stomped on then you obviously SUCK.Happy ReadingJenn :)"
1,"ve read many books, but none were as great as this one.I've read many books, but none were as great as this one. If you haven't heard of this book, here's a summary in my perspective: Hazel Grace Lancaster, a 16 year old cancer patient, is diagnosed as clinically depressed. Her doctor and parents, her mother mostly, thinks she needs to get out a little more. This means that her mother is pretty much forcing her to go to support group. Relenting, she goes, but has a sucky first day. It's pretty boring to her. But then, a charming boy named Augustus Waters comes around, which changes everything.  Together, they begin to solve a question.How will they be remembered in future life?Green wrote a sad, tragic, yet beautiful book. He handles the heavy material in a way that most likely doesn't offend anyone  who might be sensitive to the topics he writes about. John Green knows what it's like to be dying without actually dying.I would highly recommend that teens, adults, even mature kids pick this book up. It's a book that makes you think differently about life. In my opinion, there's a moral in the book saying Don't take life for granted. or Life's too short to live on fear. I mean, life is too short anyways. By the way, this book is an emotional rollercoaster, so keep tissues handy. You can thank me later.It's a beautifully written novel about love, life, and death, and it really makes you question yourself. The characters are so madly in love, but it's not in a harsh way. It's not something you'd exactly find hot (but Augustus is *cue creepy winky face*) I've never read a book or spectated a relationship with a connection as strong as the one Hazel and Augustus share.  Opinions may argue on the ending, but maybe it made the characters discover that the whole ending isn't sad. Maybe it was meant to happen, for closure. Green wrote a sad, tragic, yet beautiful book. He handles the heavy material in a way that most likely doesn't offend anyone  who might be sensitive to the topics he writes about. John Green knows what it's like to be dying without actually dying. P.S. Is there an option for six stars?Favorite quotes:Maybe okay will be our always.I'm on a rollercoaster that only goes up, my friend.My thoughts are stars I cannot fathom into constellations.It would be a privilege to have my heart broken by you.(Read the full review at sweetandsassyreviewz.blogspot.com )"
2," Blog: [...]The Fault in our Stars by John Green follows the story of Hazel Grace Lancaster, a terminally ill sixteen year-old, who meets the great love of her life at a cancer support group.  Hazel sees herself as a grenade, bound to blow up eventually, and her wish is to minimize the damage; so she keeps Augustus at arm’s length.  Augustus, however, will not be deterred.  This book is a beautiful portrayal of young love, complicated by living with terminal cancer.I love, love, love the way this book is written.  It’s very intelligent, very clever writing.  It is first and foremost a love story, but offers quite a realistic look at the life of cancer patients (to an extent, but hey, this is fiction).  If this book does nothing else, it will give you a whole new appreciation for every breath you breathe effortlessly.I adore the characters.  Hazel and Augustus are such unique, interesting characters – as are the supporting characters.  I love Hazel’s relationship with her parents and Augustus’ relationship with Isaac.  This book might have my favourite dialogue ever – I love everything that Hazel and Augustus say; like I said, clever writing.  Is this how the average teenager talks?  Absolutely not; but that's why I love it.I have to say though, while I know this book emotionally wrecked a lot of people, it did not make me cry; and I had expected it to.  I worried for a while because this book did not make me ugly cry as it seemed to make everyone else do - is there something wrong with me? - but considering I easily get chocked up while reading very often, I have just come to accept that while I loved this book, I guess I just didn't connect emotionally. I have to say that the first half of the book was better than the second half of the book, and I think maybe there was just too much hype surrounding the book when I started reading. Maybe my expectations were unrealistically high. The book by no means fell short and definitely falls under the category of best books I’ve ever read, but the tears just never came for me.The Fault In Our Stars is a beautiful book I would recommend to anyone who is considering reading it.  TIME Magazine called this book “Damn near genius”.  I would have to agree.I am just so thrilled this book didn’t end mid-sentence.  You’ll have to read it to find out why…"
5," (I apologize in advance for my writing.)As a teenager (John Green's target audience) and having all my friends rave about how good a book this was i said why not and read it. In a way I'm glad I read it, but so many things were wrong with this book. For starters I felt that Augustus and Hazel fell in love overnight. I kept waiting to see them fall in love… it never came. I thought the two characters were completely one dimensional and i generally couldn't differentiate between the two when they would take. Speaking of which they way they talked was completely unrealistic for two high school age teenagers. I thought it was just a way for John Green to voice his opinions publicly. What really ruined the book for me was the character Augustus. I felt that he was completely selfish and cared nothing for Hazel. I think he he saw Hazel as his prey and himself as a predator. He saw a lonely girl with little friends and thought hey maybe I could lose my virginity before I die and that all of his actions past their meeting was to get laid. Even when he told Issac to smash his trophies it was because he didn't like basketball anymore and didn't want the trophies. I felt John Green's decision to write it from a teenage girls perspective was a mistake as he is neither a teenager, nor a girl and many of Hazels descriptions did not feel like an actual girl. Overall I'm glad I read it. I felt that he portrayed the fact that no matter what happens life goes on well but his characters where two dimensional and unrealistic (two cancer patients would not have enough energy to do all the things they do in this book and most adults don't use that kind of language). But overall not a good book."
4," was hesitant to read this, but considering its popularity I though it would have some amazing scenes/redeeming quality. It doesn't. I kept reading, expecting it to pick up, expecting it to be worth the time taken, expecting something crazy to happen that made the entire book amazing in hindsight. Again, nothing really happens. The romance pops up out of nowhere. They talk for a couple minutes and then he asks her to his house. People searching for legitimate relationships can't build them like that! I understand that Green wanted them together quickly to build the story off of, but couldn't that have been a bit more thought out? His writing style was annoying to me with an abundance of run-on sentences and rambling. Every now and then there would be a really noteworthy quote, but for the most part I just got the feel that the characters, and ultimately the author, were just trying too hard.Now, I don't know how people relate who are actually going through these illnesses. Maybe that's where the appeal comes from. I suggest that, unless you are emotionally close to experiences such as Hazel and Augustus's, you skip this one. It's a rushed romance that ultimately doesn't go anywhere."
2," This book has THE MOST unrealistic dialogue of any book I've ever read.  The voices of the two main characters sound IDENTICAL - like the voice of a pompous, self aggrandizing author which has some delusion about having philosophical insights - which are anything but.  There is not a single character in this book - just mouthpieces for the author's boring and endless wit and insight.  Please.  Also, and someone else mentioned this in a review - there is nothing love storyish about this book.  The author TELLS you they fall in love, but he fails tragically at SHOWING you how they fall in love.  The characters are two dimensional and annoying.  AWFUL book."
2," have been a Nerdfighter for a couple of years now, and may be considered biased here, but I do judge books and music by other Nerdfighters on their own merit - and I must recommend The Fault in Our Stars. Not only is it written in a way that makes you think about the characters in the book, it also sheds some light on topics that aren't really discussed enough. Loss of children, and loss of friends at a young age. He has brought up these topics before, but not in the same way he did here. It is a really good sign when someone can have you crying in one sentence and then laughing at the next.That is what John Green does very well. He knows how to get to the reader (at least if the reader is me). He makes the book moving, but not just sad, or just funny, for that matter. He genuinely has you caring for and rooting for his characters, and though you might be able to guess the next plot twist, the way in which he writes it, the way he uses the language still makes it surprising.As I have heard some people say - this book should come with a warning label to prevent you from reading it in public places, as you are likely to cry (at least if you are one of those people who cries whilst reading books).Definitely worth a read (or several). Would recommend buying it so you get it for the weekend, it's a little bit difficult to put down."
5," The Fault in Our Stars by John Green is about a girl named Hazel who is living with cancer. She attends a support group and meet Augustus Waters, and attractive kid who takes an interest in her. Hazel constantly worries about her parents's lives and the lives of her friends, while also struggling each day to just live.I loved love this book. It was so absolutely fantastic. Hazel and Augustus are great characters, and I loved Isaac too. I literally went from crying to laughing at many parts. The humor was fantastic, and everything was very realistic, although Hazel and Augustus seemed a lot smarter than any teenagers I've ever met.There's really not much to say. The book definitely speaks for itself. If you've read it, you know how awesome it is, and if you haven't read it, then you should read it.*SPOILERS*One of the things I noted early on in the book was Augustus's obsession with self-sacrifice in the video games, which I figured had to mean something.Augustus wants to mean something to world. He wants to be able to die having left his mark. Hazel, on the other hand, wants to leave as small a mark as possible. She sees herself as a grenade that will harm everyone when it explodes (or rather, when she dies). She tries to avoid loving Augustus because she doesn't want to hurt him when she dies. And of course, it ends up being the other way around. Saw that one coming. But anyway, through Hazel, Augustus learns that it's enough to mean something to someone else, that you don't need to die a noble and sacrificial death.I need to read this book again, I think. I can't quite wrap my head around all of it just yet, but I know that it was funny and entertaining, but also sad and hopeful. John Green certainly has a way with words."
2," These 1-star Amazon reviews are better written than this book. This book is so overrated! I honestly don't understand the hype! The characters were unlikable and unbelievable. I wanted to pull my hair out whenever they were spouting out philosophy like intellects, but ended the sentence with or whatever. No. Just no. This is not how teenagers talk and adding or whatever at the end of the sentence just makes it worse. It was like the author had to remind/convince us every so often that they were indeed just your average teenagers... Not!!! I felt nothing for the characters. I didn't like Hazel or Agustus and still have no idea why they fell in love. Don't even get me started on the Van Houten story. Uch! I really did try to like this book, because once I start reading a book, I have to finish it (no matter how bad it is). That's why I'm selective with what I read, because I know I'll be stuck with it until the end. I was confident I would love this book after all those reviews. Boy was I wrong! I actually started dreading my nightly reading routine and made excuses not to go to my bed (my reading spot) in order to avoid this book that was waiting for me on my nightstand. Thank goodness I finished it! I can finally move on with my life!"
5," A crackshot attempt at sappy sob story that falls completely, totally flat; pitiful attempts at metaphors bleak and transparent. Laced with subtle misogyny and sexism just as the rest of Green's books are. Don't waste your money-- read something worthwhile, not something written by this self-indulgent, pompous man."
1," didn't think this book was all everyone has cracked it up to be. I was expecting to be blown away by it, and I wasn't at all."
1," purchased this book because it seemed interesting and I figured with over 14,000 reviews and a 5 star review, it had to be good right??Well, I'm sorry to say I was wrong. 1) I found the book incredibly slow and boring. I ended up skimming through a lot of it just to see what would happen.2) As many other people have stated, the unrealistic dialogue between the two teen characters was so odd, but then the word whatever, was used often throughout the book to convey that it was teenagers talking, as if that was supposed to make up for the fact that the rest of the time the characters spoke like two old professors.3) The two characters fall in love so quickly and frankly, I don't quite understand the reasons why. Oh and before Hazel, Agustus also had a girlfriend who died of brain cancer. But he still willingly pursues Hazel.4) I'm sorry that these two teens had cancer but Hazel was good enough to try to stay away from Agustus at first so as not to hurt him if she were to die while they were together.Agustus on the other hand, finds out his cancer has spread and that he's going to die but he waits until AFTER they have already fallen in love and have had sex to tell her. He even admits it himself that he was selfish for doing that but of course by that time, it was too late -- Hazel was already in love and would stick with him NO MATTER WHAT.5) Knowing that this book was about two teens with cancer falling in love, I knew this book would probably end up being depressing but I didn't count on it being as depressing as it was! It went a little something like this:Hazel, a girl with terminal lung cancer falls in love with a guy named (Augstus), with a cancer that caused a prosthetic leg, but who was supposed to be in remission.Agustus has a good friend who Hazel also ends up becoming friends with, and he has cancer of the eye which ends up with him going blind in order to survive.Hazel is obsessed with a book written by an author who lives in Amsterdam.Augstus and Hazel fall in love practically overnight and Augustus uses one of his Wishes from a foundation to bring Hazel and her mom on a trip to Amsterdam to meet the author.Author ends up being a jerk and girl did not get what she came for, which is to find out what happens at the end of her favourite book as it was left open-ended.But hey at least her and Agustus end up having sex for the first time and then afterwards he tells her his cancer has spread and it's terminal.Agustus ends up dying.While Hazel is at her boyfriend's funeral, author who apparently decided to come to America shows up and Hazel no longer wants to hear what he has to say.Hazel ends up finding sweet letter that Augustus wrote to the Author after he dies.The End.---------------Please don't get me wrong, I felt sad that the two main characters have cancer and I sympathized with their struggles. But I didn't believe in their love. I didn't laugh, I didn't cry, and  I wasn't rooting for them as a couple at all. And believe me I have read a lot of books that have love and romance as the major theme.Sadly,  this book simply did not make me feel much of anything except depressed."
1," Beautiful. That is, put very simply, what this book is. I finished it rather recently, no more than an hour again, and I still have tears in the corners of my eyes. This book touches you. It's a book that I can't really explain. I could sit here for hours and tell you that is it perfect. Amazing. Inspiring. Saddening. Hopeful. All in one. But I cannot make you understand what I mean by each of those words. This is book you have to read for yourself. It's a book that makes you cry, makes you laugh, and then cry again. It makes you want to yell and scream at the wonderful author, yet it makes you want to hug him to.I haven't been this into a book in a long, long time.DFTBA, my friends. Enjoy The Fault in Our Stars."
1," After seeing posts about this book everywhere, people fawning over it and quoting it... I decided to read it. Not a big fan of John Green I started it with low expectations, and I was not only underwhelmed: I was angry about what I read. Painting itself as a realistic look into what cancer is like, and the pretentious writing, not only present in the unintentional charicature that is Gus, but in the general writing, I grew annoyed. The lazy discription of the suppsed great novel, of which author they pursue, felt like a cheap trick I have read in fanfiction over the years.It was an over-all lazy, pretentious book which left nothing but a bitter taste afterwards. Personal experience with cancer made this superficial romantization of it feel like a blow to the face. How is it possible that in a support group for cancer patients there is not a single person who has the most common types of cancer?Hazel felt like a tumblr self-description of a teen girl, and it makes me feel that John Green should step away from social media, and his all too-close contact with people far younger than him, as it appears to have blinded him and given him a false view of what teens actually are like, and how they behave.As for Gus, whom people excuse as pretentious (embodiedment of the author, possibly), is a cardboard box of a character, a prop. His lines are over the top, they wouldn't be said by anyone without people laughing. He's a charicature. Not his best book. I do not recommend it."
5,"f you want to read a whiny, psuedointellectual, repetitive and tedious book this Summer, I strongly suggest reading The Fault in Our Stars by John Green.In this novel, Green seems to have the tenuous grasp on philosophical concepts of a well-read twelve year old and the descriptive genius of an overly emotional 14 year old girl whose pet goldfish died recently.This is also possibly the only book I have read that discussed, almost exclusively, another (nonexistent) book and conversations with a (nonexistent) author that completely ruins the (already lacking) reality of the story by making a genius author into basically a drunk version of the somehow snarky-sarcastic-overly-intelligent-but-still-somehow-painfully-under-informed  teens in the novel.It isn't a story about teens, or even teens with cancer, it's a self-masturbatory work (and not a good one).On the up side: it is short."
1," This has been a complete blockbuster of a book. I can see why. John Green is a wonderful writer and there are many reasons to love this book. There were also reasons why this book is not for me, and I'll get to that in a bit.The Fault in Our Stars (love that title by the way) by John Green is a book about Hazel, a cancer patient, who develops a relationship with Augustus Waters, another cancer patient. The way they meet, how their relationship develops, etc is very well done. I loved all the literary references, and the witty dialogue is something I've always loved about Green's writing. The conversations are really sharp, and that was probably the biggest strength of this book. I also thought a lot of the medical talk was very authentic-- and since I'm in the medical field and rarely feel this way when reading a book, that's a big compliment.And now for my reservations. I know everyone has loved this book and I am very much in the minority with these issues, but hey, I'm a reviewer and this is my honest opinion. I wasn't as incredibly moved overall by the book as most people, likely BECAUSE I am in the medical profession. I think to a certain extent that we medical professionals get rather numb to this sort of thing because we see it all the time and if we were completely overwhelmed by it, we couldn't do our job. I think I was less into this book because it is so much like my life, and I use reading as an escape.A couple of other minor details. I was a little shocked that a method of cheering up Hazel was taking her to Anne Frank's house. What?! Someone could at least ask her if she was okay with this plan. Second, I'm a little freaked out by how Augustus is attracted to Hazel because of her cushinoid appearance from the steroids she has been taking and how this makes her look like his ex even though in reality, they look nothing alike. That really bothers me.Overall, extremely well written and I can see why it got all the glowing reviews it did-- it deserves them. But because of my background, this is not my book."
1," WARNING: if you're trying to maintain a tough-guy image, read this book alone. Tears will be jerked. Life will be affirmed and mirth will be felt, but mostly tears will be jerked.It is young adult fiction, and like most of John Green's books, it's a fast read. I read it in one sitting without too much difficulty. I plan on reading it again someday, which is as high a recommendation as I can think of.Also, my copy was signed with a GREEN Sharpie. :P"
5," know I may be in the minority but I absolutely hated this book.  I have never read a book filled with annoying characters who obviously are doing their best Holden Caulfied brooding act.  I could not even enjoy the sadness of the book because of all the teenager as all wise Yoda tripe.  Seriously, the deep meditations on life and insights into each other's soul bit was too much for me.  Sorry rabid fans if you don't agree.  By the end of the book, I didn't care what happened to either of our plucky young teens.  I just wanted it to be over!"
2," The Fault in Our Stars isn't about cancer. (Cancer is so bubblegum and watered down in this book it takes backburner to nearly everything else.) The Fault in Our Stars is about John Green. It's about John Green's adoration for the generation that made him famous. It's about John Green rehashing tired philosophy from the existentialists to make himself appear intellectual to his child-dominated audience.The structure of the book is the same as Dog Soldiers by Robert Stone, as it is less of a story and more of characters waiting for a story. The opening (the Literal Heart of Jesus) is the same set-up as Fight Club, with the group counseling, a guy who has his balls cut out, and a character meeting an eccentric character that changes their life.As other reviews have expressed, every character in this novel is John Green. Hazel is John Green's consciousness. Augustus (who's name is cleverly taken from Augustus Caesar) is John Green's pseudo-intellectual mouthpiece. All of the parents are John Green's ideal version of his own parenting style. Most of the plot involves Hazel obsessing over an author who has written book about cancer and ended it on an ambiguous note . . . like John Green.John Green indirectly writes about himself, and it seems he knows little else to write about. He references Fitzgerald and Vonnegut as if he is on their literary level. This narcissism is not in any way earned. He hasn't created a body of work sufficient to the authors he compares himself to. I could leave this paragraph with this idea, but I want to address the issue further. Narcissism, while naturally abhorrent, can be overlooked when the author is offering something of substance or genius. What is John Green offering? Childish paraphrases of philosophy books that are nearly a century old or older. Still, what is even worse is his own pseudo-philosopophical pandering. For example, several times in the book it is marveled at the depth of a character putting a cigarette in his mouth but refusing to light it. It shows the cigarette industry doesn't have power over his decisions. John Green treats this immature concept as if it is a brilliant philosophical revelation. But if we look at the action closer, it doesn't make any philosophical sense. To any mature adult, the cigarette isn't their rival; if you choose not to smoke, you choose not to smoke and life continues. There are bigger issues than if someone chooses to smoke. People who don't smoke (in life, not in fiction) do not have reason to publically display apologetic behavior. Augustus has no reason to make the cigarette industry his philosophical rival; he does so because John Green finds the action quirky. As countless YA novels have proven, quirky sells to the teenage demographic. (This is why Augustus also has a goofy smile.) The philosophy in The Fault in Our Stars isn't philosophy at deeper examination, it's just marketing.Both the characters and the plot are shallow. Hazel, who we are thought to relate to, describes herself early on in the book as having no interests in anything besides America's Next Top Model. She is asked to describe herself, and she is incompetent to even think of one adjective. She, however, refers to herself countless times in the novel as awesome or great . . . for a reason she can't even figure out. I understand this is relatable to today's myopic female demographic, who has little personality and few interests. I could accept this character on terms of realism, but, let's face it: characterless female protagonists make for no more interesting reading than their real life counterparts make for good spouses. Then John Green introduces Augustus, who is a stand-in for the perfect guy, in that he gives the female protagonist something to live for, because it is implied she had nothing before him, except her favorite book. (As most teenage girls reading this kind of book wish Augustus would come and give them something to live for.) He pursues her for little to no reason (other than she looks like Natalie Portman, I guess). This isn't atypical of today's real teenage male trying to affirm his decision to chase a girl he knows is uninteresting and unintelligent. There is a scene where, in true to life fashion, Augustus tries to pry any sort of commendable personality traits out of Hazel. (After his failure to find anything interesting, he ends up commenting that she doesn't write poetry.) What is unrealistic, however, is that a teenage male would fall in love (as loose as the term can be used) and take the ridiculous lengths that Augustus does for such a girl. This seems more wish fulfillment for the female demographic than a plausible plot. [SPOILERS] By the point this wish fulfillment reaches its climax, John Green is so out of the spectrum of realism that he has his characters making out in the Anne Frank House while people clap around them. Soon after they have sex and Hazel is described as sensually feeling Augustus's stub [leg]. [END SPOILERS] I can't, as most readers have, ignore this absurd plotting and poor writing.But who is asking for realism? Apparently none of John Green's fanbase. After the starting point of the two characters meeting, the novel turns into something of a fantasy. This is the most unrealistic portrayal of the thought process teenagers with cancer I've ever read. To put it simply, it's laughable. The only attempts Hazel, Augustus, and the secondary characters make to deal with their own impending deaths seem to be angst and sarcasm. There is no psychological difference between these teenagers and normal teenagers. They constantly spout the existential depth John Green ham-fistedly forces into their dialogue, but none of them attempt to understand the actual depth of accepting their own deaths. I put like to put emphasis on this because it seems readers of this book don't understand the full extent of what these characters are ignoring. I do not buy for a moment that this is how teenagers react to a medical death sentence. The teenage characters in this book scoff at counseling (which is realistic), but their own scoffs seem to be the end of their thought process on the subject of their own deaths (which isn't realistic in the slightest).I think it is now time to write about my own experiences with the subject matter. I was diagnosed with cancer when I was 16, and pronounced in full remission when I was 21. I've been through months of chemotherapy. I've sat in children's cancer wards for most of my teenage life. I've waited for PET scans to pronounce if, to put it bluntly, I was going to have a life. I don't think this is the place for me to go into my thoughts during this time. I will say, from my own experience and the experience of the teenagers I've met with cancer, they understand death and do not react to it with sarcasm or petty philosophy. They don't quote Sartre. They're afraid. They're upset and exhausted. They don't act as if everything is fine and lead a normal (if angsty) life as the teenagers in this novel do. They don't have the power to stop their treatments at will, as is a point in the novel. They lose their hair, puke constantly, take shots several times daily in their legs, physically smell like medication, and only have the energy for social interaction perhaps once a week--if it's a good week. I don't recall any characters in this book having difficulty or pain from the port in their chest. None ever complain about the taste of saline that never leaves your mouth. It is to the novel's fault that John Green ignore[s] with a grin (to quote him) the facts of cancer.If John Green learned to focus on social realism (as he thinks he does), he would have an interesting stance on story structure. If he would replace the angst and childish musings in his writing with developed prose, he would be decent at technical writing. Every problem this novel (and its subsequent generation) has is one with inability to grow up. It is entirely possible that John Green could be a decent writer if he were to mature."
1,"t is very poetic, and overall not a horrible book. However, it's just not my cup of tea. I like books that lead me to read between the lines and think about the irony of everything instead of just being told what it is. This book plainly tells you what it is. For example, Gus having a cigarette in his mouth yet not smoking. Green could have just lead us into figuring it out, but instead he automatically told us exactly what it was supposed to mean. Give your readers more credit."
1, Everyone has ranted and raved about this book. I found it dull and lifeless. I was underwhelmed and disappointed. I would not recommend it.
2," read.....a lot.  Quite possibly the worst book I have ever encountered.  It begins with no hope, continues with no hope, ends with no hope.  Nothing learned, nothing gained throughout the whole story.  Just a bunch of punk kids, sadly dying of cancer, who never stop feeling sorry for themselves, or punishing the people around them.  Please don't read this book if you think it is about love, forgiveness, hope, or encouragement.  You won't find it here"
1," don't usually write reviews. In fact, I believe this is the first time I've written one on Amazon. This book, however, deserves a review. I'm not talking about a synopsis of the book detailing out all the nuances. I'm talking about an honest-to-God opinion on this book.I laughed, I cried, and I loved it.Not only has John Green written something that's witty, he's captured suffering, darkness, and love in a book that feels very real and leaves me wondering if I've learned a lesson or two from it. All I can say is that anyone can pick up this book and read it--it's a delightful, honest, smooth read that I absolutely had to sit and read cover to cover in one sitting.Buy it. Read it. Enjoy it."
1," This book has so much hype, yet when I read it, I found it sappy and rather boring. The love story between Augustus and Hazel is a rather boring one. I could tell the plot line after reading the first chapter. I do not recommend this book as it is sappy and seems to jump from place to place. I also read Looking for Alaska and that also had great reviews. I am thinking the author is trying to live out his teenage years all over again, but it just comes off as a public service announcement. BORING and PREDICTABLE"
5," bought this book per recommendation of a friend. I had liked her previous suggestions, and after reading the rave reviews, I was sold. I can't really say I was disappointed...because I didn't really feel anything at the end of the book, or at any time while I was reading it. Gus and his metaphorical lifestyle were so contrived that it was almost funny. What teenager...with cancer...carries around an unlit cigarette in his mouth but doesn't give it the power to kill him? Give me a break. Lame, uninspired, and uninteresting."
1," Five stars.---I'm going to deviate from my normal review format when reflecting upon this book. I feel that this novel is more deserving of a mess of plus marks and minus signs, of pros and cons. This review will be half of my opinion, and probably more directed towards the fictional characters of the story, and less towards the nonfictional people who read my thoughts on books. For that, I am sorry that I am not sorry.If teenage Hazel is anything, it is that she is no stranger to thinking about life and death, though namely the latter. She has lungs that do not know how to be lungs, and though a new medicine is lessening her suffering, she has been diagnosed with terminal cancer. It is at her cancer support group that she meets Augustus Waters, a cancer-free survivor with a prosthetic leg and an interesting take on the world around him.Hazel and Augustus are the most beautiful couple that I have ever read about. Keeping in the theme of the title of this story, it is the faults of these characters that make them so intriguing, relatable, and completely unforgettable.Every word, from Hazel's internal thoughts to the pair's dialogue and everything in between is smartly and stunningly written. Each word is no doubt strategically placed by one John Green to make this book flow with undertones of love, haunting, and a strange metaphysical feeling that made me personally feel both like the universe is leaps and bounds bigger than myself and that I am nothing more than a speck in an infinity of lives lived.... But at the same time felt a sense of this life is what you make it, and so you must live today all that you can. Who knows if tomorrow will be your Last Good Day?Augustus is a boy that I would have felt privileged to know. He shares a lot of similarities with other book leads- sweet, funny, likable. But there's something more to that. He had this intellectual wit and view point that made him seem both quirky and wise beyond his seventeen years of life. He was strong, and romantic (even if it wasn't so subtle). And the extent to which that he loved Hazel is awe-inspiring and heartbreaking simultaneously.And then there is Hazel. Her thoughts seem so rational and sensible to the point that they at times seem cold. I like that her thoughts follow this darkened pattern with bursts of bright optimism and worth. Both characters just loved each other so harshly and so fully, it consumed everyone around them. Strangers, family, friends- everyone could see just how much the pair cared for one another, and it was lovely. I can't help but to think of an Edgar Allan Poe quote to describe them: But we loved with a love that was more than love.I am pretty sure that I felt every possible emotion during the course of this novel. I admittedly cried more than once. I got the warm fuzzy aw feeling that one sees when two old people are holding hands, or when a puppy and a kitten are curled up together in a box. I felt inexplicably happy and laughed, I grew sad and I mourned. I cheered characters on, cursed others, grew angry, frustrated, and confused with their actions.Now that I have finished reading, I just have this weird sense of.... Well. I am acutely aware of the fact that I am alive. I can feel my pulse in my neck, I am hypersensitive to the breeze wafting towards me from the vent. I just.... Feel.I must state here, since this is a review, that I am very blessed and fortunate enough to not know anyone who is suffering with cancer. I do have to specify, using Hazel's words, that this book is a cancer book, not a cancer book- there is so much else going on. Because I can not relate to the level of illness and stress in this book, I must say that if you do know someone, this book may be all the more meaningful and heartbreaking to you.I feel that this is a book that deserves to be read by everyone and anyone who is able to read, and those who cannot should make someone read it to them aloud. Five is the highest number of stars that I can allot, and I assure you that I have found no fault in them.Thank you to the Christi the Teen Librarian blog for my signed copy of this book."
1," This book is a.m.a.z.i.n.g. It is a quick read, but the story lasts an infinity. The book is so sad, yet so good that I couldn't cry. I almost did, but thinking about the way the story ended and all the love, I just couldn't. I'm fourteen, but very mature for my age. I am what I call a readaholic. I finished this book in one day and two nights. All of these people at my school say how great the book is, and how incredibly sad it is. Only one of my friends said this story had a bittersweet ending. And it truly was. This story is full of so many sophisticated ideas and makes me see death in a completely different way. Those people that said they cried for hours and said they hated the ending, just weren't intellectually mature enough to understand the true meaning of the end. Death means something. You may go to heaven or hell, you may be reincarnated, or you may disappear into oblivion. No one but the dead know truly what happens when we die, and that should be their secret, something for them to hold on to. I always seem to wonder, would I want to go to heaven, or be reincarnated, or disappear into oblivion? I don't know. I honestly and truly do not know. I, like all humans, want to make an imprint upon the earth, but I don't know what my imprint will look like. Will I save lives? Will I become a philosopher, a scientist, a poet, an actress, or an author? I do not know. But that's life. Life is about facing challenges, and figuring out what our imprint will be. This book taught me that. I don't even know if I want my imprint to be that deep. Maybe, I'll be one of those people that change the world by simply noticing things."
5," Although the protagonist is a teenager, she speaks like she's just finished a degree in American lit. In truth, the voice is neither feminine nor believable, as it perfectly echoes the real life delivery of John Green in one of his YouTube video blogs. (Green is a nearly thirty-seven year old who just so happens to be an English major.) That the book has such a large following is proof that we have become a society of lazy readers. The Fault in Our Stars is trite, predictable and at times, pretentious. Sadly, it undermines the value of faith. (In truth, it outright mocks faith.) I cannot imagine this book will have an enduring fan base. It will fall away, as (I believe), will the Twilight and Hunger Games series. The Fault in Our Stars does nothing to enrich the reader or further the art of fiction."
2," picked up this book because of its ever-growing popularity among my sixth grade students.  I believe that the author is very brave for taking such a hard-nosed, reality driven approach to the subject.  Unfortunately, I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this book for the young audience that it seems aimed toward.  The horror of cancer is no excuse for exposing young lives to such language, inappropriate sexual explorations, or disrespectful attitudes.  Parents should really think before handing this book to their children.  Words are powerful, and these could do far more harm than good."
2," The kindest thing I can say about this book is that I was not its intended audience.  I have always been confused about the distinction between fiction and young adult fiction, but make no mistake--The Fault in Our Stars is a young adult book.  For me, this formulaic Cancer Story was a bit too contrived.  Is it possible that a teenage girl with cancer would be insightful and philosophical?  Totally.  But would she meet a drop-dead gorgeous, funny, smart, equally-insightful and philosophical teenage guy with cancer who immediately falls in love with her?  Probably not.  I believe Hazel and Augustus would call the success of this highly-predictable book a Cancer Perk.  While I can see why other people LOVE this book, it just wasn't the book for me."
1, Holt McDougal is one of my favorite authors and this is his greatest work to date. You can find Holt on tumblr at fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com because he is an avid fisherman.
2,"t says right in the book THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION. Green MADE IT UP. Why is everyone all oh my god this is such a beautiful story, i can't believe it's a real story.??Also the book was awful. A staring contest, really?  Augustus only noticed her because she looked like his dead GF... so original.Hazel and Augustus knew each-other for a couple months. And she agreed to travel around the world with him. They hardly knew each-other. Hazel couldn't even tell his sisters apart, or remember their names.The book sucked. Would give it 0 stars if that was an option."
5, They talk about getting cancer perks. Liking this book would be giving them a cancer perk. A waste of my time
1," Here's my John Green impression: Sometimes the cow walks to slaughter because it's easier for the farmer. It's, like, the grass only grows sometimes to see the sun. That's how I feel about cucumbers.This book is like pulling teeth. It's pretentious and predictable. Its characters are flat and immensely unlikable, and their every action is recorded. We have pages upon pages of what they're eating and wearing and what kinds of shoes they like and what books they're reading and what movies they're watching--how did this make it past an editor? Also, I don't buy their love at all, it seems incredibly artificial. Oh, and A+ for using the Anne Frank House as a trendy backdrop for your douchey love story. I feel like I'm reading some boring kid's diary, I don't understand why John Green is so highly rated. On the bright side, this is the sort of bad writing that translates very well to the screen, so there's still some hope for the movie. God knows it can't be worse than the book."
1," started reading this book thinking it was going to be really, really good. My comment at the end was ...HUH!.....when is it going to get good, make me cry....something......anything. I feel like I must be on another planet than the one holding all the raves. I will say that I had to look up more words then I ever have in a book in English! How can you write a whole book about 2 kids with cancer without stirring an emotion in me? I should be blubbering and taking sinus medication for my stuffed up head! I'm pretty sure I must have missed something.......So I am skimming it again! Surprised? So am I...but am beating myself about the head and shoulders because I feel the need to do this.......I've GOT to know if the shortcoming is with me or with the author. I feel like I must have an IQ of about 218,000 other people LOVED IT! I think I'm going to make a doctor's appointment to check out my dead emotions! Maybe there is a pill for that!"
2," This book read like a lifetime movie. It was clear from the beginning that things weren't going to end well for Augustus and Hazel. The characters were so unrealistic and sounded strangely like the voice of John Green. The main character could at one point be more mature than any adult I've ever encountered, and at the next second start yelling at a stranger for having cigarettes. It was just silly. And the imagery, oh man... She hugged him and felt his muscular chest... I just can't take this seriously."
2," Half way through, I knew exactly what was going to happen. I didn't feel compassion for either of the characters, I didn't relate to them in any way. I found the characters absolutely unbelievable. I teach, and all of my years of teaching I have yet to encounter a teenager that can properly use the word hamartia in the correct connotation. It just doesn't happen."
5,"t seems like a remake of the Nick Sparks book A walk to remember.  The names have changed to protect the innocent, some *very minor* story arcs added, and events change order, but all in all the same book.  If you don't like Nick Sparks, you won't like JG.  I'm going to try reading some of his other works to see if there's an original story out there, but this book is a potential lawsuit waiting to happen."
2," did not like this book at all. This was probably my least favorite book of all time! I really tried to like this book, because I heard so many great reviews from friends and family, but, wow, I was so disappointed! The only reason I read the whole thing was because I kept expecting it to get better at some point, and it never did. One of the biggest reasons I disliked this story was because the two main characters were narcissistic, selfish and unheroic. Even their love for each other seemed so shallow and vain. The boy, Gus, had an ego problem, and I couldn't help getting the impression that he loved himself more than the girl. Also, the girl, Hazel, was sarcastic, emotionally needy, and completely unrelatable. Their dialogue was over-the-top, and consisted of them constantly trying to prove that they were smarter than everyone else on the face of the earth. Also, it seemed like all of the characters in the book had the exact, same personality-narcissistic, big headed, sarcastic and vain. I kept expecting them to grow and develop as characters, but they never did. It was almost as if the author felt like narcissism is an admirable or heroic quality (News Flash--It Isn't)! Also, the very act of narcissism goes against true love, so the story doesn't make sense. Real love puts the other person FIRST, and self LAST. A narcissist can not experience genuine love, because they love themselves more than anyone else. Gus and Hazel were two of the biggest narcissists I have ever read about.  Another reason I did not like this book is because I didn't like the author's voice. I got the impression that his philosophical views are jumbled and confused, and his views on philosophy are a HUGE part of this book. I kept expecting the characters to come to some kind of an understanding as to what their philosophical beliefs were (because they talked about it constantly), but they stayed confused on this subject and never had any growth. After reading the book, I couldn't even tell you WHAT Hazel and Gus believed. The most I learned is that Gus believes in something. When I read that, I literally went, Huh?Anyway, I gave this book one star, because I didn't like the author's writing style, didn't like the characters or the story, and I would not recommend this book."
2," bought this text book for my high school astronomy class and it got me a big, fat, effing F."
1," This book is woefully, god-awfully bad.How bad?So bad that about halfway through you're actually rooting for the cancer. (Spoiler alert--&gt; Hang in there!)Like ninety percent of the one-star ratings here, I will tell you that these teenage characters act and speak like anything but teenagers.Actually, they act and speak like thirty-five year olds with B.A.s in English and Religious Studies -- coincidentally the age and academic credentials of the author, John Green.The dialogue of a thirty-five year old is very distracting when coming out of the mouths of sixteen and seventeen year olds. The reader is always conscious of the fact that a thirty-five year old English/Religious Studies major named John Green sat at a desk somewhere and typed this dialogue into Microsoft Word.You want to yell at the pretentious Gus and the girl character (jeez, I can't even remember her name, and I only finished the book yesterday), but it's not their faults -- it's the author's.To make my point:Years ago I had a friend and co-worker who was a WWII Navy veteran and an avid reader. We used to discuss and swap favorite books. One weekend I loaned him my copy of Catcher In The Rye. The following Monday I asked him what he thought.He said, I hated it! I wanted to slap the crap out of Holden! I've got no patience for such cynical, self-absorbed whiners!Notice that my friend did not direct his ire at J. D. Salinger."
5," saw this book pretty much everywhere and was hesitant because of how much hype was around it. Definitely not worth the hype. Another reviewer put it perfectly saying that the dialogue was stilted. A lot of people defend the lack of realistic characters by saying that it's a work of fiction and the John Green was pushing the envelope. The characters were not bizarre and unreal because they were smarter than most teenagers or spoke intelligently for being teenagers they were unrealistic because no human speaks like this. However, these things only add up to the one large problem with the book is the fact that it is impersonal. It is about a girl who was somewhat cynical, and trying to be truthful but it had no element of truth. It was a wanna-be Catcher in the Ryeesque narrative but it was too safe. It never entered the realm of being relatable and real, it was lacking the rawness that it needed to make it good. Because of this, I really could not enjoy it. I would suggest any of these books/authors as a substitute for this one:Black Swan Green By David MitchellA Catcher in the Rye By J.D SalingerThe Outsiders By S.E Hinton (pretty much all of her young adult fiction is good)To Kill A Mockingbird By Harper LeeOld School By Tobias WolffThe Great Gatsby By F. Scott Fitzgerald"
1, Book about a complaining teenager. First she is scared to hurt everyone. Then she falls in love but can't act on it because she'll die and hurt him.. Then he dies and she's not really that sad. so clearly dying doesn't really hurt people.
1," This is a very easy read with an engaging writing style and the subject matter is heart-breakingly refreshing with such an unfortunate yet likeable lead character.  However, the romantic interest in our heroine is so far over the top that it renders the plot ridiculous.  I'm far from being a critic of altruism to the point where I believe the world could use a healthy dose more of it, but this book pushes the edge of belief.  I got 3/4 through it before I hit the Home button and removed it from my Kindle."
1, Cute story but not the greatest writing. The storyline is predictable and cliche. Very little character development and it's hard to become invested in their stories. I have no idea why this book became a best seller.
2,"m a pretty normal teenage girl, and i don't read very much at all because nothing seams to catch my attention. The Fault In Our Stars on the other hand was fantastic. I read it in 2 days (not normal for me at all) and would recommend it to anyone and everyone i know (and i do).  Its in my top three books along with Paper Towns and An Abundance Of Katherines both other John Green books, he has inspired me to read more and he is a very talented writer."
1," Whether you think of him as Holt McDougal or as John Green, one thing you can be sure of is his talent. Gus and Hazel's story is amazing, and you will not be disappointed. (Though you may be disappointed that you bought it via Amazon.)"
5," This book was such a waste of time. The hype surrounding this book was ridiculous. I gave it a chance, read it all and at the end just stared at the last paragraph thinking, did they really think this was going to pull at your heartstrings like other works that deal with loss, cancer and teenage love? Not at all. This book is trying to be emotionally poignant and yet, I wanted to chuck my kindle against the wall."
2," Whenever the characters of a story suffer, they do so at the behest of their author - the author is responsible for their suffering and must justify his cruelty by the seriousness of his moral intention. Lionel Trilling from A Gathering of Fugitives.This book is purely manipulative. The suffering is trivialized (cliche after cliche - smart-ass dismissive comments about suffering - silly, immature posturing that disrespects real wisdom or insight with it's artificial profundity.) What was this author's moral intention? He didn't have one. What was his intention? To be cute. To sell a book without expending much energy on language, style, and most significantly, insight. Too much work - that -  when the easy platitudes can be found on-line. This book is to literature what McDonald's is too food. It is  neither."
1, am an elementary librarian.  This title kept coming up on suggested reading lists for me to read and purchase.  I have a K-6 school.  I am always looking for chapter books for my sixth graders to read.  So I purchased the book on Kindle.  Frankly I was disappointed.  The language and some of the content was definitely not appropriate for my students.  I wish I had known that it was basically a high school level book.  The story was okay.  I felt like it was too emotionally manipulative.  I did enjoy the way the title was brought into the story.  I did feel like the characters were true to life.  It just did not measure up to all the hype and high reviews I had read.  Of course what you read and enjoy is always personal and varies with every person.  I could have passed on this one.
1," After reading Looking for Alaska, I found John Green to be an impressive writer with his clever and quirky style and sophisticated subject matter for the audience he was writing for. Then I read Paper Towns, and I started thinking that maybe it was just a fluke. After reading The Fault in Our Stars, though, I was especially disappointed. With all the hype it has been getting, and the fact that it's been turned into a movie, you'd think it would have been one of his better books. But actually, those were just the signs that it was just the right kind of simplistic, underwhelming romance story that audiences have been craving in the past few months thanks to the other adaptations and reincarnations of young adult novels. And sadly, this has been one of the worst books I have read in a while.The plot is a contrived mess, and the two star crossed lovers, Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters, who are both suffering from their own forms of cancer are just unintersting. They seem to lack anything resembling real emotions, and the only time you are aware they are actually experiencing those emotions is when the narrator straight out tells you that that is exactly what she is feeling at that moment: depression, joy, pain, discomfort, etc. There is rarely a moment where they express themselves beyond their ironic, snarky, teenage selves that could elicit more than a little affection for these characters. So when anything important happens, it just falls flat.Overall, the book was just boring and a chore to get through. I regarded John Green as a fairly competent writer, but what happened here? I understand the work put into this book, and the people involved as well as with the movie, but that doesn't make it any better of a book. I'm sorry to say that  this is not a book I recommend. And after all this, I feel like I need to reread Looking for Alaska just to make sure that there really does exist a good book by him, or was I just imagining that."
2," really really wanted to love this book, because really, what kind of heartless bitch could find fault with a story about two terminally ill cancer kids falling in love.  And I believe that it is this same wish that has so many other readers lauding this undeserving book.  Any author who has the courage to attempt to tell a story about two terminal cancer patients has my deep admiration.  Unfortunately as lofty as the aspiration is, the finished product falls short.  The writing is at best, mediocre.One of the biggest problems I had with the book was that most of the characters are not fleshed out; they are empty and boring.  The ones that aren't flat out boring are weak (the father,) horrible (Peter Van Houten) or not developed enough to elicit a sympathetic response from the reader (the mother, Hazel Grace, Augustus' family.) Frankly, nothing about Hazel Grace was attractive so I didn't really give a rip about her.  As I was reading about this uber cool kid Augustus falling in love with the utterly ordinary girl Hazel Grace, the Twilight similarity was impossible to ignore.  Like the Twilight story, I was completely unconvinced that either of the males in the stories would fall in love with either of the females.  There was nothing unpleasant about Hazel Grace (Bella), there was just nothing notable about her.  She never registered on the personality detector.  And I am actually amused by people talking about any comedic tones in the book; like Hazel Grace's personality, they never made a ripple. This book was a huge disappointment mostly because of the potential there was in the premise."
1," have to say, I truly hated this book. The characters were fake and all the EXACT SAME. All of the meaningful parts of the book such as the cigarettes and okay were very stupid. I amm quite dissapointed considering the hype."
2," read this book because several of my students were reading it and would not stop raving about it.  It is not my regular genre.  I tend to stay away from realistic fiction because, in truth, I don't want to read about something that could really happen, especially when that something is cancer.The book for me was okay.  Yes, just okay (and not in the okay that the two main characters kept saying to each other).  The main girl (whose name escapes me right now, which tells you just how much I got into her) was a terminally ill cancer patient who did not want to partake in life because she didn't want to cause others pain when she died.  All of that changed when she met Gus, a cancer survivor, who refused to take no for an answer.I enjoyed Gus' character a lot because of his carefree ways.  I also enjoyed Isaac and the battle that he dealt with.  I think I resonated more with the parents in the story (maybe because I am a parent and can imagine the heartache of watching someone you love go through all of that).I just felt that everything felt flat.  The love story did not grab me the way most relationships grab me in stories.  The middle through ending were predictable (and I'm a big fan of twisted shockers).  The character of the author, although comical at times, didn't feel interwoven as well as it could have been.I know that there will be many teens who wish me diarrhea for lacking in my ability to connect with this story and the epic (my students' word) love story told.  I just didn't feel it.  I teared up only once, when the girl's parents were telling her how they will carry on without her.  Once! And I am an emotional sap.  If nothing else, that in itself told me that the book was just okay. :-/"
1," cried for the first time on page 124, and from there? The remainder of the book (which I could have easily read in one sitting - had my kid not needed fed, and bathed) you could hear the following from me: Oh. My. Gosh. I Love Him! (Or her.) **SWOON** No! No! No! No! No! and just as regularly? Laughter - typically through my tears.We could all tell a cancer story, it sucks. But it's true. I don't know anyone who doesn't have one. My best friends little sister. My Grandmother. A good friends father. It's everywhere. And, Hazel is pretty much right. For many of these people, life becomes a side effect of this evil disease. But John Green has made it relatable. Rather than just looking in on cancer from the outside, as I have often found myself, through Hazels eyes I was able to somewhat experience the effects in a more personal way.One thing that I had me absolutely floored was my ability to get lost in John Green's story lines. This was so much more than just a story about the evil monster that is Cancer. This was a love story, and a very sweet one at that. This was a story about a girl sharing her love for a book.Now, I know that anyone who read the synopsis - anyone who saw the blurb by Jodi Piccoult - can make an educated guess that this one will have some tears. But this book is about so much more than this. It's about Hazel Grace and her amazing ability to fight, about her learning to live. It is about Augustus Waters and his sweet and amazing personality. It is about their friend Issac and their cancer support group. It is about  the parents of Cancer Kids. It is about a book. And a swingset. (Ok, maybe not a swingset - but the metaphor that John Green throws in at the mid 100's? The most amazing thing I have ever, EVER read.)In the end? This was my maiden voyage into the world of John Green, and I was most definitely not disappointed. In fact, this may be one of my top ten books of all time. I cannot say how much I loved it. It was sad, it was beautiful, it was romantic. (And best of all? It was real.)"
3," Yes, I'm not the intended audience at all. 22 year old guy.C'mon though. Remember Catcher in the Rye. That's how 16 / 17 year old adolescents talk / act. Right?This was unrealistic. Green tried too hard. I saw another reviewer say it was like he made the characters sound like him. If you watch one of his YouTube videos, you will agree.The cuteness annoyed me. Cancer isn't cute. The characters had cancer, but it only came up when it was convenient to the plot or when he wanted the sorrowful scene.The mini prologue he ends with I made [the story] up. I found that to be redundant after reading the book."
5," do not typically read books of this nature (with somewhat depressing themes). However, overall I enjoyed it. I will summarize my thoughts for any other parents concerned like me about this book. Grade: B+ / A- (though mostly because my reading preferences tend towards light historical romances). Possible indirect spoilers below, tried to keep them out, but keep it in mind please.Summary of my thoughts: Good book if unsurprisingly on the depressing side of things, more cursing than necessary (for tween readers) but rides the line of acceptability considering the life altering circumstances involved, sexual content is appropriately negligible (present but brief and not gratuitous or detailed; though at least one (sexual) word referenced I could have done without), somewhat snarky dismissal of religion not my favorite, but not overwhelmingly so, alcoholism is addressed but not in detail, and it does a good job of conveying the intense and genuine feelings between the main characters in a positive and healthy if doomed way, and yes, there are some lovely quotes to take note of.This book is for an advanced YA reader, hello metaphorical resonance, and if they are in a flurry to read this, I suggest you read this first in order to determine if it's right for your tween/teen; maturity is a must, but it is well written and a worthwhile read. Now I'm off to find a silly or light romantic story to bring me back from the ledge of feelings caused by the book's ending. Good luck fellow parents. :)"
5," Though there are aspects of this book that I liked, overall, reading it was painful.  Too often when writers try to show teenagers struggling with the philosophical aspects of life and death, the dialogue comes across as forced.  Sadly, John Green falls into this trap.  Very rarely do the interactions between Gus and Hazel ring true.  There were many times I wanted to skip ahead so I wouldn't have to continue reading the unnatural dialogue between the two characters.  If he had stuck with the simple moments, this book could have worked."
2," Contrived, clichéd, unbelievable. Little wonder I read this age group anymore. I saw it everywhere on Tumblr and Instagram and wanted to try it. Halfway through, I sold my copy to my local used bookstore. Sorry, I'll go back to quality fiction."
2," You know that feeling how the last food item you eat before coming down with the flu is forever ruined. For me, it's corn dogs and I'm ok with that. I don't feel like it's really a loss that my last corn dog was consumed at age 10.Now have you ever had that same feeling for a book? I recently discovered that I did with The Fault in Our Stars. Somehow (did I put the book on a hold?) it popped up in my library queue and I read it. For those who don't know anything about the book it's like Twilight, but instead of vampires the kids have cancer. Now I'm not saying the book gave me cancer, but it's not entirely in the clear either. Maybe it planted the seed, I don't know. What I do know is after reading the book I was diagnosed with Leukemia. Now, when I think about the book and characters, my stomach churns as if I'd just taken a big bite of greasy carnival corn dog.You can imagine my surprise when I was upgrading my sound experience in the living room and I stumbled across the book sitting comfortably on our bookshelf. I forgot that my wife had purchased a copy for a work trip. Twenty minutes after the book was discovered, I walked to the nearest bus stop three blocks away and dropped it off for an (un)lucky bus rider to pick up and read. Goodbye, Hazel Grace and team."
1,"m not certain if this is a teen/young adult book, but as a 67-year-old grandmother, I enjoyed it. My 13-year-old granddaughter told me that she was reading it because a lot of her friends were talking about it. I want to stay involved in her life, so I put in on my Kindle. I read it during a two-day drive.I found it to be very interesting and informative. I felt I was reading someone's diary. It provided wonderful insight into how a cancer patient feels about how they are treated by parents, family, friends, and outsiders. Taken from a teenager's point of view, I found it enlightening to know that they can feel 'smother love', cynical about their recovery or remission, and yet still hopeful for a 'normal' life of marriage and children.The personalities of the main characters are well-defined, but subject to change as the story progresses. We come to understand how the parents' feelings affect the daily lives of their cancer-affected children, and how they come to realize that they must let go and let their kids grow.It is funny, happy, sad, informative, and will tug at your heart. I shall check out the author and consider more of his books, even if he is a young person's author. Interested in how he researched such a complex story-line."
1," do not understand why everyone likes this book so much! My reading teacher was really pushing it so I read it, but I was so disapointed! I didn't even come close to crying at the end, like so many people promised me would happen. I thought the characters were overly sarcastic, to the point where it wasn't even funny anymore. The writing was incredibly pretentious; it sounded like the author was just trying SO hard to make this a modern classic, but it just didn't quite work. Every other word sounded like the author picked it out of a thesaurus, without actually knowing what it meant. The plot was actually quite boring and cliche, it is honestly just another depressing cancer kid book that didn't even make me cry. The characters were all so completely perfect, and unbelievable, I didn't find myself at all sad when *spoiler alert* one of the main ones died at the end. The best word I can think of to describe this book is OVERRATED."
4," For a book that lauds itself as transcending the conventions of the sick lit genre, Green's portrayal of terminal illness is one-dimensional overly simplistic.Yes, I do speak from experience. And yes, I know, a youtube friend of his died of cancer and inspired him to write this book. While that's a fine source of inspiration, Green either needed much more research or to pay more attention to said research. I am thinking primarily of his astoundingly insensitive portrayal of caretakers. For those of you who don't know, Hazel's mother is her caretaker, and Green blithely ignores the physical and emotional labor that entails, to the point where Hazel's mom says herself she is not technically very busy. Green, if you had first-hand experience with terminal illness, you know that caring for the terminally ill is often a full-time and demanding job. This is one of many ways in which he fails to accurately portray the reality of living with a serious illness, and it is a slap in the face to the people personally affected by it. When writing about tragedy that affects so many, one needs to tread with caution and respect; Green does neither."
2," The Fault in Our Stars is a beautiful, tragic, funny, and masterfully crafted piece of literature written by one of today's finest authors, John Green. Green explores the reality of living with disease and the nature of fate in the context of the teenage life in his newest novel and does so with an awesome literary prowess that will leave you staring at the page admiring the absolute majesty of how the words form together on the page, and at the same time desperately wanting more. I believe this book to be the best example of his work since his debut novel, <a class=a-link-normal href=/Looking-for-Alaska/dp/0142402516>Looking for Alaska</a>, and this is high praise indeed. Like all Green books this book is profoundly meaningful, while also genuinely funny, and of course captures the honest truth of being a teenager (rough edges, cursing, and sexuality in all). If you're a teenager: read this book. If you used to be a teenager: read this book. If you have or had cancer: read this book. If you know someone who has or had cancer: read this book. If you're reading this review: you should probably read this book."
1," To quote Hazel Grace, the book's delightfully insightful, smart, and empathetic FEMALE (YAY) narrator: Sometimes you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book.That is exactly how I feel about The Fault in Our Stars.This book gutted me, and I mean that in the best possible way. John has found a way to take the reader on such a beautiful journey through this book...it's really a gift, more than a book. It's powerfully transcendent, in the way that John, through Hazel, can make observations about the human condition that are just so goddamn universal. There were so many moments when I literally said, out loud, YES! Exactly. It's also funny, quirky, and nerdy, as you would expect nothing less from a Nerdfighter. And yes, it's sad, but such a beautiful sadness. I sobbed through parts of the book, trying desperately to keep reading through my blurred vision and dripping nose.You MUST read this book!"
5," This is the first time I felt a real need to write a review for a book. To such an Amazing book. It's been 3 hours since reading The Fault in Our Stars , and I am still utterly speechless and awed.This is not so much as a review, but as a reaction to how I felt reading the book. John Green's Characters are so memorable, I knew them, I felt for them, Their joys, and pains, their struggles and triumphs. I cannot emphasize enough how I feel for the main characters of this book, but as a person suffering from much of the same thing they were, I felt a sense of connection I have never felt with any other book of Fiction. Somehow, Now, I am hopeful.This book is for the sick and healthy, for the young and old, for the weak and hopeful, To just about everyone who doesn't mind being touched by teenagers, two in particular, Hazel and Gus, who cherished the infinities between Life and Oblivion.But there is no shortage of fault to be found amid our stars."
5," This is probably the worst book I've ever read. It was hard to understand (real teens don't talk the way the main characters do in this book), and it didn't even have a good or MEANINGFUL ending!!! You couldn't really tell they were even in love. They just acted like really good friends.... So there's no romance in this book. John Green should not have written it in a Teenage girl's perspective because girls DO NOT think the way Hazel did. It was unrealistic and very disappointing. I was expecting this to be the best book ever because of all the hype. With the movie coming out soon, I hope they don't base it totally on this book. Yes, I'm glad I read it, but I never will again. It SUCKED!!!"
5,"ve always enjoyed John Green, which is the only thing preventing me from giving this one star, but I just really don't get the obsession and insane 5 star ratings. I read this before it exploded among the public and snagged a movie release and didn't find myself impressed with it, yet gave it another shot after the hype and stellar reviews...maybe I missed something, right? Nope. I found the characters as pretentious and bland as ever, with no depth to their relationship other than hey, we both have cancer and hate the support group. I found the writing and language boring as well, almost as though it was something written for a high-school short story contest...and it didn't win. I usually dislike giving poor reviews, however, it almost agitates me the type of hype that this book is receiving. I suppose you could just consider this a rant."
2," read this book to help me cope with the death of my 16 year-old sister, who died from bone cancer two months ago. She loved this book, and I guess I was looking for a way to feel closer to her even though she's now gone.I wasn't expecting this book to really speak to me the way that it did. All of the thoughts and feelings that Hazel Grace had in the book were related to how my sister's situation felt to me. It felt just so surreal that someone could capture how my sister's death was making me feel when I myself could not find the words to describe it. It made me finally cry the tears that I had been holding back this whole time.God...I miss my sister. I'm heartbroken that she's no longer here, but now I have a book to reach out to whenever I miss her too much.I love you, Muriel. I always will."
2," honestly expected it to be better based on all the hype it received. This is a good read, a fast read, and a nice story. But it is not a revolutionary work of art. It reads like a poorly researched cross between my sister's keeper and an episode of the OC written by Nicholas Sparks. The plot twists made themselves obvious miles in advance.I liked the characters, kind of, and read it in two days. So there's that. 3 solid stars. Points were docked for the tired plot and terrible understanding of cancer and how it works. Points were also docked because it's cheating to write a novel about kids dying of cancer. Nobody can come right out and tell you how mediocre of a book it really is. If it was a movie, it would have to win an oscar just so nobody would get offended."
5," For a very long time, I have followed John and Hank Green as the vlogbrothers, yet never reading one of John Green's novels. I'm 24, and felt a young adult novel wouldn't touch base well, despite the reviews I've read for every one of his books.Problem was, The Fault in Our Stars struck a little too close to home for me not to read it.I had a bout with cancer like Hazel, and so far have walked out with the help of an experimental treatment. This book retold those times I had, those struggles, and made me realize how lucky I truly am. Even more, I live in Indianapolis, home of John Green and the setting of the book. So much of this hit so close to home.Read this novel. You won't regret it. It doesn't matter your age. Keep the Kleenex's close. And realize the triumph we have in our lives."
3," Too many faults to list.The voice of the teenaged characters is far too intelligent and often whiny and annoying. They bitch so much, and so routinely see themselves as superior to everyone else, that I cared little for them, and actually wished for them to just get on with it and die already.The plot lumbers on, does not race to a finish as it should. I dreaded reading the last half of this book, but was surprised how abruptly and improperly it ended. Still, I was thankful it ended.But I am happy for John Green and his success with this novel, as I would be for any writer.This could've been a far, far better book, and sold only a handful of copies. Instead, it is a mediocre book--at it's best--and has sold hundreds of thousands. Bravo!"
5," just finished reading TFIOS and can't say enough good things about it. It is beautiful and tragic and honest and funny and brilliant. I am not ashamed to say that I cried, and I rarely cry at novels.I feel like the characters might laugh at me for crying; for feeling so much for fictional characters.I'm not going to describe the book other than what I knew about it when I first picked it up. It's about 16 year old Hazel, who has cancer. I think that by not knowing anything more about it, it made the book better. I didn't read reviews because I didn't want to know anything until I could read it for myself. I made the right choice.The Fault in Our Stars is a beautiful, heartbreaking, stunning novel. Well done, Mr. Green, well done."
2, Not particularly well written nor entertaining. Can not recommend to readers of any age. Disappointed as reveiws were so good.
5," This is one of the worst books I've ever started to read. I could not finish it. The first chapter was rude, the kids can't speak proper English (like...I have cancer) and the whole thing is a liberal cliche' from the get go. I stopped only a few chapters in. I've never stopped reading a book this early. The fact that this book is a no. 1 seller only reflects the low-level intellect of this country. Americans feed on Twilight, 50 Shades, and this? Pathetic. HORRIBLE and disrespectful. Please do not buy or read this book. You will thank me later."
2," Okay. The topic is cancer, and so we can't say how truly dreadful John Green's writing is? Oh my gosh. He is not Faulkner, Hemingway, Jack London. He's not anything but a guy capitalizing on our fear of disease. I can't believe all the people fawning over him as if he is the Messiah, or the Buddha. He's not. He's a guy making millions. Have you heard of Love Story---did the same thing. Made people weep over cancer and love."
1," have read quite few books in my own sixteen years, although I've only been reading for eleven, and only books that have a meaning for probably six of those sixteen. Generally, because I read so much, and write so much, I'm slightly detached from any situation in text. I may tear up, but it doesn't have enough behind it to warrant the tears. I read this book in 2.5-ish hours, and and probably one of those hours was spent earnestly laughing through my earnest tears. The words are real, and well put together, and very much felt as one reads them. They suck you in, so you think that some real person is telling their real story. I'm still shaking."
5, saw the previews for the movie and heard everyone talking about it so I paid the $4.99 for it and hoped to read a great book.This book sucked; maybe I was expecting more but I saw what was going to happen everytime before it even happened. I didn't cry once and wasn't the least bit surprised by the ending.
2," This book is excellent, Holt McDougal is an excellent author! I have read all of Holt McDougals books. Some of my favorites include Party Time In Your Pants and The Adventures Of Candy In Your Pants. He wrote Party Time In Your Pants at a very vulnerable time in his life while he was up in Canada looking for Alaska and you can really feel that emotion in his writing. There is an abundance of Katherines also spread out in his writing, probably because of his intimate relationship with (now passed) Katherine McDougal who was legally his sister.This excellent sequel continues the adventures of Candy in the paper towns that were created by Mrs. Manlove (also now passed). Candy meets a young boy called Grayson. The real question this book asks it's young reads is Will Grayson... Will Grayson finally find love? I'm sorry that was hard for me to type. It just makes me so emotional. That question is answered in this text in a very satisfying way, with his frankly gorgeous style of writing I have no doubts that Hold McDougal is the only one who could have pulled this off. At the end of the book there is a very beautiful moment where Candy Stripcakes announces Ah heck. Let it snow! and I think that about sums up this review. In the words of Candy (Holt McDougal) Let it Snow! And may the Zombiecorns never win the war for banks island."
1,"m a middle school English teacher and saw a lot of students reading this book. I picked it up without knowing what it was about, and I was instantly hooked. Hazel is a snarky narrator who falls in love with an equally snarky guy, and they both make this book grimly funny. It's obvious John Green, the YouTube personality, wrote this book...in a good way!There is one slow part towards the middle, and it is predictable, but it's an easy read and something different than I'd ever read before.  If you enjoy young adult lit, you'll like this book.  If you can, try the audio book!"
5,"t would be so easy to give this book a five-star rating that had no meaning.  John Green is a very interesting man who, outside of this specific novel, does wonderful things to teach, entertain, and decrease world suck.  I will admit I was very tempted myself to give his most recent novel, A Fault in Our Stars, a five-star rating because of this, because he deserves it.  He went to great lengths to make sure that each of his readers had an untainted reading experience, which I appreciate and really did improve the experience of reading it for the first time.But, you think to yourself, you did give the book a five-star rating.  Indeed I have given the rating the book alone deserves.  This book has absolutely outdone all of the, admittedly high, expectations I had.  I don't want to go into detail about the specific things I loved about The Fault in Our Stars because it seems almost too personal to share in a book review.  The things I've taken away from this book are the sort of quite lessons and insight that you carry with you and talk about to your close friends deep in the night.The Fault in Our Stars is not a tear-jerker in that it manipulates your emotions to find purpose, but it brings tears to your eyes for the sheer beauty, ugliness, pain, joy, unfairness, triumphs, and pitfalls.  I spent most of the time reading this book in tears, I think tears of mourning lives left unlived and the great injustice disease is.I feel that until now I did not understand, outside being aware of the abstract idea of it, that another person's existence is as real as mine.  John Green has done me the great favor of making this important fact vivid and real to me.  I cannot recommend this book enough.  It is absolutely wonderful and I thank John Green, Esther Earl, and all of the individuals who came to have some influence on The Fault in Our Stars' success.  Not a monetary success or in fame for the author, although those are sure to come, but a success at being real, being loved, and teaching me to be a better person."
4," pretty much loved everything about this book. And I'm not going to lie to you and say it's all sunshine and roses and daffodils, but you could probably guess that much. I've always been a huge fan of John Green and was overly excited when I received the book in the mail. I couldn't put the book down and finished it in about 4 hours. It's been about 3 days since I finished the book and it's something that I can't stop thinking about. I just keep going over the details in my mind. The book is an excellent one and I highly recommend it to everyone. DFTBA."
5," Everyone is entitled to their opinion, right? Quite a few people suggested this book, to my daughter, to read. I purchased it for her birthday, and she was super excited. She read it, over the next few days, and then came to me, saying how much she hated it. It is not an appropriate book for children under 18, and from the bits, and pieces I read, and from what my daughter told me about it, I wouldn't waste my time reading it.There was a lot of strong language in it, and moments of teenage intimacy. It is basically about dying children having sex. If you are into that sort of thing, you will love it, if not, you might want to avoid it."
5," have never felt so incredibly overwhelmed by any other novel.  I laughed, cried, smiled, sighed...And sometimes all of that happened at once. This book is something special, no matter how trite that may sound.  This book touched me. And it feels like the very best gift.The characters are lively and fresh.  The story line, which should be utterly depressing, comes with a lot of hope and inspiration.  The dialogue is fantastic...I cannot say enough good things about TFiOS. I cannot come up with adequate words to express what this book means to me."
1," have been literally waiting (correct use of literally)for this book for half a year.  I can't help but say those trite words, It made me laugh.  It made me cry.  There was alot of crying and even more laughing, but the crying was completely heart-wrenching.  There was a bit of time that I was not sure that I would be able to finish the book over a single line that was just too hard for me to read. I have never felt that strongly about a sentence in my life.Now, I have to say that I have a special bond with the subject matter because I am the mother of a cancer survivor. He is 13, almost 14 and has been NEC (No evidence of cancer) for a very long time. But the fear never goes away.  It lives in a part of your mind that you try not to notice.I cannot say what the sentence was, because it would be a spoiler and above all I want people reading this review to read the book.  So no spoilers, but the sentence is at the top of page 112 and it was said by Hazel's mom.So, please read this book.  It is not only good, but important.  It is hard to find books that are both these days.  The subject matter is true, engaging and terrifying...it will make you laugh, but it will also make you cry. DFTBA"
5," have been waiting to have the money to buy this book because it had so many great reviews. I heard that it was fantastic but I don't know what makes it fantastic. The only part I felt connected to was the part towards the end and it was touch and go. I really feel like I wasted $10 and now it's $4. Very upset by that but what can you do, nothing. Back to the book. I read a lot of books in every genre but this was very difficult to understand and poorly written. Teens were talking like grown people and grown people were talking like teens. It felt forced like someone chose a tough subject to write about and everything else was just thrown in to fill up pages so a book about a very sympathetic issue could be sold. Was there a romance, I don't know because it never peaked. I think the great reviews are from people who haven't read any good authors yet or are just being sympathetic about the issue of cancer. I have family who have died from cancer so yes it is a touchy subject for me but this book, any book, should make you feel something, John Green's The Fault In Our Stars, did not. It's so sad because there is potential to educate people on this subject being a known author, but he didn't do that and it's just sad."
5," had read/heard such great things about this book and was so excited to get started. The excitement quickly ended, though, as I really struggled to both finish the book and connect with the characters. While I could excuse the beyond their years language as I do believe kids in these types of situations are forced to grow up so much faster than the average child, I found the love between them hard to believe. It really felt forced and unrealistic, especially given the limited contact the two of them had. And overall I felt that the book didn't have a good flow to it - the story was choppy, the characters were undeveloped and the story just never quite captured me."
5," had heard so many great things about this book so I decided to read it.  I am so glad I checked it out of the library through my Kindle instead of buying it. I did not like this book at all.While the topic of cancer is not a joke, I felt that in this case it was used to pity the characters.  There was nothing believable about the romance between the two main characters.  By the middle of the book the ending was clear and predictable.  I do not understand how this book got so many great reviews, I just don't see it."
2," Cancer patient Hazel Lancaster has been treated for cancer for as long as she can remember. She attends a support group where she dutifully shows up. Then she meets Augustus Waters. Gus also had cancer and he loves Hazel for who she really is. In this story, two terminal cancer patients fall in love and face important life questions like where we go when we die and how we can enjoy life while we are still able. As Hazel puts it, “I cannot tell you how grateful I am for our little infinity…You gave me a forever within my numbered days (Green 215).” This book did have some good themes, but overall it was remarkably unsatisfactory. The title, “A Fault in Our Stars,” gave some insight into cancer in today’s society. It plays off the theme established in Romeo and Juliet. When the stars are crossed, nothing good will come out of it. Green also did a good job addressing major questions that teens have in regard to death and dying.  These questions include where we go when we die, what people remember about us, and the impact we have on the world. Ultimately, we will never be remembered, even if we want to be. Gus found this to be true. I have read many fiction books and novels; however, this does not qualify as a well written book. It uses casual language which people use every day, making it harder to read because we all hear these wearisome, unexciting words often. It also uses a lot of swearing. Swearing can be good in some cases to characterize someone or illustrate a point, but Green uses too much of it for no reason. Another major dilemma I have is the fact that no one in real life would act the way Gus and Hazel do. What teenager is going to be totally obsessed with a weird book, meet the love of his or her life at a support group and fly half way across the world with them to visit a drunken author? Obviously, Green’s plot is not realistic. Though this book has some good themes and ideas to demonstrate, it is severely lacking in skillful writing, language choice, and probable plot events. So I would say that although this book might have some relevant topics, pick something else on the shelf. You can do a lot better."
2," Thankfully I don't have to be the guy that gives a rotten review to a book about two kids with cancer. I was teetering, but then the author pushed me over to the mostly happy-happy side.Everything started amazing; I relate well with macabre gallows humor. When you've knocked on death's door and have seen the priest standing over your hospital bed, a bit of morbid humor gets you through.Then there was the trip. They had to go somewhere, right? They couldn't just sit in the basement and play video games for the whole book, could they? That whole trip seemed out of place and unrealistic to me--until I read the author's acknowledgement to the Dutch Literature Foundation, thanking them for the two month stay in Amsterdam. Ahhh.Speaking of unrealistic, I have trouble believing a 17-year-old video-game-playing athlete would have nearly the same vocabulary as a 16-year-old study-at-home, read-all-the-time, collegiate student. I get it; he's smarter than the average hunk, but some of the words he came up with were the author's indulgence.And one more nitpick: I don't believe a flight attendant would pour a 16-year-old a drink, even as a Cancer Perk on a return flight from Amsterdam.As for the author: he's smart. You can tell he is well read. And not only that, but he is well-versed in today's internet terms (he has over a million Twitter followers and a popular YouTube channel). This all plays out in very believable verse (aside from the notes above). The narrative is catchy and modern, which helps pull the reader into the story--making you feel like this is taking place today.I was also impressed in the author's research, not only around cancer, but in blindness and limb loss.Overall, the story was a fantastic read: emotional; thoughtful. It would have been an easy five stars if not for the critiques above."
2," think when you read a book that everyone LOVES, sometimes expectations are not met.  Maybe its better not to read too many glowing reports?  If you don't love the book as much as the others, you begin to wonder what you have missed!!!That's the case here.  I liked the book.  It was a different story of 2 teenagers who have cancer and their relationship with each other and those around them over a period of time.  Hazel was a deep thinking teenager with some fight about her.  Augustus was a bit too pompous for me to really enjoy the character....but there seemed to be lots of forced witty dialogue that I couldn't imagine teenagers speaking like that?  In that sense, it all felt a bit contrived.As for recommending it?  I can't.  It just didn't hold my attention or make me want to turn every page to see what would happen.  I don't regret the time reading it but I forgot a lot of it, the minute the story was ended."
4," Where do I start with this book?  I've been a John Green fan ever since Looking for Alaska, a book I desperately wish that I'd written.  Now comes another one that I wish I'd written, but I will have to content myself with writing about it.I won't bother with telling you the plotline - you can read the book description for that.  Instead I'll tell you what this story does for you -or did for me, anyway.The Fault in our Stars takes you apart slowly, lays all the pieces of you out, mixes them up, then puts them back together in a different order. You come out of this story a different person, a little sadder, a little more joyful, and a whole lot soggier.This is the only time I've cried for the entire last two-thirds of a book. By page 117, I was sniffling.  By page 199, I was leaking tears.  From page 204 on, I was a quivering wreck.Lest you think this book is a downer, just know that the weeping comes with equal parts of cheering and laughter as you root for Hazel Grace and her true love Augustus. They are two of the bravest, most likable protagonists to come along in a YA book in a very long time. The emotional weight of the book comes from the fact that we really love these two kids and are hanging in there with them the whole way.If you want to go on a profound, life-changing journey, read this book. If you want to fall in love, read this book.Dang it all, just read this book."
2, thought it was boring and unexciting.  I expected it to be better since there is so much hype about it.
5,"f you liked The Bridges of Madison County or, God forbid, it's sequel (who's title fortunately, escapes me) then this might be the kind of book you like. It's not badly written, just wildly improbable. Sort of like John Green himself there is a slightly irritating feigned insousance in just about all the characters. It's a potboiler."
1," bought this book hoping for a signed copy from the author Holt McDougall only to find some joker scribble in the name John Green. Fix this,  Amazon!"
2," As soon as I received this book, I couldn't stop until I had devoured each and every word of it. I nearly went through a box of tissues and yet found myself laughing amidst the tears. John Green has most definitely out done himself with this book. If you enjoy reading good literature, then this is one that you can't afford to miss."
5,"n selecting this book I wanted my heart to be touched.However, as my fellow one-star reviewing predecessors have said, The Fault in Our Stars is pretentious and annoying. It is characteristic of what sells on today's homogenized bookshelves - a charming male lead (contrived completely of his ability to formulate sentences by his use of overlooked adjectives), and a cookie-cutter female lead who does nothing other than exist. We've seen this before. Many times.The story opens with some sense of intrigue, yet as it progressed I found myself becoming uninterested with Hazel and Gus's cliched romance. And as the inevitable approached, I actually found myself wanting to put the book on the shelf, forget it, and move on. Yes - I was so unattached to either character that I didn't care who died or when.And that's what brings me to to this: In selecting this novel we quickly come to know the basic plot. Therefore we set our hearts accordingly. We hunger a fantastic revelation that will make us walk away feeling refreshed and eager to pursue our life in its fullest capacity. Yet, The Fault in Our Stars does not deliver what is expected. And you walk away upset to your computer, venting to Amazon hoping that another poor soul like yourself doesn't fall into the same money-making trap.In short, this novel is a fantastic read when in the hands of the proper audience. Lest we forget, we all enjoyed The Catcher in the Rye as teenagers but later came to find ourselves cringing at the antics of Holden when we revisited Salinger's masterpiece as adults."
5,"n spite of my reluctance to read about cancer, since my mother died of it just over 1 year ago, I took a chance anyway.I really wanted to love this book, and after having read the thousands of glowing reviews, I was sure it would be so...Well, turns out I couldn't disagree more with the 5-star reviews.Hazel and Augustus are not especially endearing or even likeable, even though they are youngsters with cancer. I repeat: youngsters with cancer. And yet they did not manage to move me at all. I've never met any teenager that speaks like them, even if some of their ideas were colorful and deep. But seriously, most of the time their conversations felt like I was being fed pseudo-philosophy by the author. I understand many were shocked by the speed with which they started their relationship and then jumped into bed, but in all honesty, when you know the clock is ticking you can't really afford to waste time, so that wasn't really an issue for me. Their parents, on the other hand, were great characters and extremely relatable. Van Houten, well...let's just say I don't know if his character helped or worsened the whole thing.Maybe the fault is mine, because I thought the characters were going to walk us through what they were feeling - both physically and emotionally - and how they faced their impending death. Instead, all I got was another teenage love story, which would've probably been fine had I not had these wild expectations about the seriousness of this book.That's why I don't understand the hype. Seriously. Every time I decide to take a chance on a best-seller I end up disappointed. If this is what the best-seller list is all about I want nothing to do with it. And since this was my first experience with John Green, I don't think I'll be giving him a second chance either: trying to jerk tears out of the readers with a pitiable love story is not writing - it's called manipulation."
2," Originally posted on my blog: www.book-scents.comThe Fault in Our Stars is something I've put off reading for forever. The subject matter scared me! Kids and cancer. That is a recipe for heart aching disaster for me and for my heart's sake, I put it off. However, with the movie coming out and all, I wanted to read it before watching it. I mentally braced myself. I started reading, preparing to have my heart ripped out.Now, I don't know if it was the hype or the fact that everyone touts it as a masterpiece, amazing, life changing and all that but... I feel like I didn't have that same connection with it that everyone else did. Which is kind of disappointing to me. I feel like I need to inform: I cry easily. Very easily. I get emotionally invested in all books or movies and I cry during them all the time. I expected to cry. I teared up but I didn't have the gut wrenching sobs I thought I'd go through. I'm not heartless I swear!! The story was sad and touching but I felt disconnected from it.I think one of the main things that made me feel the disconnect was the dialogue. I realize that Augustus Waters is supposed to be witty and funny and clever and everything but I just can't imagine a 17 year old boy talking the way he does. 17 year olds just don't spout eloquent monologues on the spot! Or even craft them ahead of time as beautifully as he did! It just didn't seem plausible and sometimes Augustus and Hazel's dialogue just came off as pretentious to me. Don't get me wrong, Hazel's snark made me smile but most of the time I found myself tilting my head to one side and thinking, really? did this speech just happen?I can practically see the mob coming for me now. *hides* Granted, there are amazing quotes from this book. They're poignant and insightful and I love it -- but it really didn't seem natural coming out of a 16 and 17 year old.Maybe the dialogue was what took me out of the story enough that I didn't cry. I'm not sure. I don't know what it is. The story was sad to be sure but this book didn't leave the lasting impression on me that I expected it too."
1," Well I am still thinking about The Fault in Our Stars even though I finished reading it over three days ago.  If you judge how good a book is based on how often you think of the story once you are finished, then you could consider this one a winner.  For me personally, there was a lot of hype for this book, so I went in with high expectations.  While I found the characters had real to life attributes and attitudes, I also found their outlooks very different than expected.  Maybe that is part of the draw of this book, it is the epitome of  the unexpected in this reader's opinion.  Hazel and Augustus are a rare pair and an unlikely match in some ways. They just get each other and there is the element of understanding that probably no one else could even get close to in their situations.  It was refreshing in a way to view their unique perspectives and it really made me ponder about the tough subject of cancer and how it really affects people. So why did this reader not give the book five stars?  Ah, well I hate spoilers and I refuse to put one in here.  Just suffice it to say that while I understood why the book ended the way that it did,  but it completely frustrated me!  Also, I was not understanding at all of the universe wants to be noticed instead of any direct reference to God, a supreme being or an after-life. Personally, that sucked all the hope and comfort out of a terminally ill cancer patient's future.  Don't we all need hope and something to cling to, like faith?  Even if you aren't a person who is Christian, most people believe in some type of an after-life and the fact that Hazel really doesn't believe in that at all, bothered me to no end!  Everyone NEEDS hope!!!!  Rant over, you will have to read it for yourself and decide your own thoughts.  I believe that the story will draw you in as it did me, and perhaps you will appreciate the ending more than I.Rating:  Language and teenage sexual references"
3," ****POSSIBLE SPOILERS****After a lot of thought, I think I have nailed down why I was not blown away by this book. I read it because my young teenaged daughter wants to read it, and I always try to know what she is reading. I also had been told how awesome the story was by adults in my life. Please keep in mind, that this is how I feel about the book and I am in no way trying to say that no one should read it (everyone should read what they want and then make up their own mind) or that if you loved it, as an attack on you.First I will say why I gave the book a generous two stars:1. The pace was good and didn't drag-that helped me get to the end a lot faster.2. I loved it when Augustus' parents wouldn't let them watch a movie in his basement.Now for why I was so disappointed:1. The characters' development was non-existent. I never connected with Hazel nor Augustus. The fact that they had cancer was almost an after thought; and the struggle, arc and growth that you would expect from a plot with two teenage cancer patients was just not there. I also feel like we were never even given a chance to get to know their families either. The supporting characters were more like stage props than the SUPPORT that a supporting character provides a story.2. I figured out the dramatic/traumatic twist of the story half way through. Not only did I figure it out, but when the scene happened, I found it to be very ANTI-climatic.3. Language...I am adult and when I read an adult book, I am totally prepared for language. This is advertised as a teen/young adult book and let me remind you that one reason I read it was to see if it was appropriate for my daughter to read. I don't necessarily mind when a book meant for teens has one or two little profanities, especially if it is in the correct context of the situation the character may be facing; but the language in this book is ridiculous. There is no good reason for the majority of the cussing other than to have teenagers cussing. Ironically, the one instance that I DID NOT have a problem with is when Augustus drops an f-bomb. It fit the scene and what his character was experiencing in that moment. Now, I am in no way saying that it is RIDDLED with profanity, because it isn't. I just didn't see the reason for the cussing that IS there. To me, it had no purpose.4. The pain didn't seem real. Cancer, and especially cancer in children is a horrific thing to contemplate. I never felt their pain, their fear of dying, there anxiety. That the fact that either one of them could die soon was the reason for their utterly fast and all engrossing relationship was not communicated well. The cancer was made to be more of an annoyance and the parents of the children with cancer especially so. I HATED how Hazel and Augustus treated their parents' concern for their wellbeing and how their parents were written to be these blubbering, annoying individuals with no depth. I was especially disappointed in the idea of cancer perks. Even if that is true, the fact that Augustus at one points acts like he thinks it is ridiculous in one part of the book, only to manipulate people with it later in order to get what he wants (like champagne on a plane) really got under my skin.So, there it is. I am sure that most people wont like my review because they love a book that I don't, but that's ok. I don't expect everyone to love the books that I do and that's just fine. That is what makes people and people who write about people so special. If we all liked the same things, there would be nothing left to write/read about."
3," Chrissy's 5-star reviewDid I enjoy this book: This is one of those books that I have been wanting to read for quite some time. I am so glad that I took the time to read it. It was unexpected.I heard a lot of great things about this book, and I was worried that I wouldn’t like it or that it wouldn’t live up to the hype. This book was as good as everyone had said. It lived up to the hype.Okay, let’s get into the book. I thought The Fault In Our Stars was very real, gritty. I couldn’t imagine being that age and facing my own mortality. The kids–Hazel, Augustus, Isaac–they didn’t sugarcoat anything. They were real, bitter, upset, trying to fight. I enjoyed that. It made me connect because it seemed more true. I rooted for them throughout the book. It wasn’t rooting for a longer life, although that was part of it. I was rooting that they got the chance to live life.As I was reading, I did something that I hardly ever–more like never–do, I skipped ahead. I read parts and found out what was going to happen. Not because I didn’t know what was going to happen, but because I wanted to be prepared for it. Not that you can ever truly be prepared for death and dying. I just needed to know ahead of time. Seriously, I don’t do that. When the final Harry Potter book was released, I avoided the news, internet, people, etc. until I read it. I like to be surprised by books. I like to find out the story as it unfolds. With The Fault In Our Stars, I couldn’t wait. I had to know.This book isn’t all sad all the time. It is romantic; it is sweet. There were a lot of wonderful laugh out loud moments. This surprised me, but didn’t. I would think that when you are going through something like this, you would need to find something humorous. Something to make you laugh. I loved Hazel’s friend Kaitlyn’s line about Thin Mints. That cracked me up. The egging was hysterical, especially when the mother came out of the house.These are the words that sum up The Fault In Our Stars for me: real, funny, sad, thoughtful, sweet, romantic, angry, tragic. This is a book that I will probably read again.Would I recommend it: Yes.Belinda's 5-star reviewDid I enjoy this book: Yes. Amazon recommended it to me based on my reading choices. It looked interesting so I bought it.It’s kind of creepy how well Amazon knows my taste in books. The Fault In Our Stars is a beautiful and poignant story of teens battling cancer.It’s the kind of book where the bad guys win in the struggle between teen vs. cancer. It’s a sad book but one worth reading. Green takes you on the journey with Hazel and Gus. Like all teens they’re trying to see where they belong in this world. Unfortunately, they also know that they won’t belong in this world for very long.Fortunately for us, they made a strong impression for the short time we spend with them.There’s a quote at the end of the novel that I love. Fearing he’s losing Hazel to illness, Gus said, “ . . . you don’t get to choose if you get hurt in this world, old man, but you do have some say in who hurts you. I like my choices. I hope she likes hers.” It gives me goose bumps every time I read it. There’s nothing like youth and tragedy to make a novel sparkle. Well done, John Green.Would I recommend it: Absolutely."
2," THE FAULT IN OUR STARS tells the love story of Hazel and Augustus. Both, incredibly funny and intelligent, and both, diagnosed with fatal diseases at young ages. For Hazel, she’s lived with her lung issues for years, everyday knowing that it could be her last. Augustus; however, was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, but was classified as in remission after losing half a leg.The duo meets at an illness support group that Hazel’s parents make her go to. The chemistry between them is undeniable and they soon start spending all of their time together and learning more about each other. This leads to Hazel having Augustus read her favorite book – An Imperial Affliction – which ends abruptly with the reader asking questions. Hazel desperately wants to meet the author and find her answers before it’s too late for her, so when Augustus offers her his “wish” from the Make-a-Wish Foundation, they go on their adventure to Amsterdam to meet Peter Van Houten, the author with all the answers…..or so they think.After a less than productive meeting with Van Houten, Gus and Hazel spend some quality time growing closer in Amsterdam. This is when Hazel finds out that Gus’s osteosarcoma has come back. Once the pair is back home, Hazel spends the time she has left with Augustus showing him how/why his life has turned out exactly the way he’s wanted it to.Never has a book made me laugh so hard to the point of tears and then cry just as hard, but from sadness. This was a good book. I read it in two days and when I wasn’t reading it, I was trying to figure out when I would get to read it again. I loved the characters, all of them – even Van Houten. I also really wish An Imperial Affliction was a real novel cus I wouldn’t mind reading it.I was hesitant at first to read TFIOS because I had heard that it was so sad. But I am so glad I did. It has become one of my favorite books and I’m sure that if I were to reread it – no matter how many times – that I would still laugh and cry in all the spots I laughed and cried in before. That, to me, constitutes an amazing book. And who are we kidding, could John Green ever write a bad book? No. Probably not. :)"
5," * I'm an old guy in my 50s and thus well beyond the target audience for this book - which to my puzzlement - has been labeled as a work of Young Adult Fiction.* I'm not going to waste your time and go over the plotting and themes of The Fault in Our Stars.  Many others - thousands in fact - have already done that in a wonderful way.* I'll just say that before I turned to page one - that I went in with a healthy dose of skepticism about The Fault in Our Stars - because other so-called Young Adult titles - e.g., the Hunger Games, the Divergent series and the Harry Potter series - in my mind, did indeed feel, in my mind, justifiably within the marketing implications associated with the Young Adult label.* But in my view, The Fault in Our Stars takes a BIG fork in the road for many of us older adults - that's off-the-charts phenomenal.  I read a lot of literature and non-fiction - and I myself could NOT believe how I got sucked into this book.  Its content is so beguiling - and its prose so effortless - that I found myself not thinking about how well-written, how exquisitely expressed its themes - which in turn made the clock melt away.  As I have often written elsewhere, this should be the dream achievement of all great writers, i.e.,, to compose words and phrases and ideas that makes me unaware of an author's writing style.* I DID NOT have a problem with the hyper-intelligent teenage characters in this book - sounding wiser than their years.  Please don't diminish the achievements of The Fault in Our Stars because of this singular criticism.  Confession:  I had a cancer scare when I was 19 and I know what went through my mind facing life and death issues - at an age when everyone else was out partying.  I have kept a diary since I was 15 - and I know how this experience - accelerated my maturity and gave me a sudden grasp of what was, until then, impenetrable existential themes previously beyond my reach.  The thoughts purveyed by the teens in this book came naturally - as I remembered how much my life back then - was freighted with more urgency, e.g., trying to put my best face on for pals - while coping with what felt like the cruelly numbered days moving forward.* Please, for older adults having problems with the overly wise dialogue spewing forth from these teen characters, please do this:  Just add three or four years to ages of the characters, i.e., pretend Augustus and Hazel are in their early 20s, pondering seemingly obscure life issues.  I guarantee you, the believability of their dialogue will still feel authentic.  I went through these very conversations and dark observations so many years ago.  Regardless, I myself was fine with everything in this book.  It did NOT feel pretentious to me.* What's strange is The Fault in Our Stars has been out for more than two years.  My regret is I was SO LATE to recognize its achievements - because I did not, until recently - seriously embrace the acclaim it has long received from its readers.  So I apologize for my tardiness.  This book ends beautifully - with worrisome clichés avoided.* The Fault in Our Stars is, in my view, a major work of fiction in a suburban setting - with grand themes presented in a straight-forward way.  It is tender and humorous and inflicts blunt-force trauma that bolts you to the floor.  I confess I choked up many times, enough so that I said to myself - you know, if I was a teen again - without the experience of the many years that have long since passed - that I would be a bawling wreck.  I would've had a tough time going to work or school the next day, paralyzed by contrasting emotions of being in love for the first time - while being hyper-aware of our small place in a universe filled with billions of other humans for whom life goes on with seemingly less urgency.* In sum, this book reminds me of how we're all just passing through - of how we're likely to be forgotten by other people arriving two generations after our demise - but who still, via the young words of Augustus and Hazel - can re-experience something beyond our earthly existence, something that feels eternal."
5," When I began reading this novel, my first quick impressions were that it was clearly well written but the knowledge that the lead character was a 16 year old girl with stage 4 cancer was a bit worrisome, because well, the end most certainly is inevitable and would be hurtful so did I want to put myself through that?  I am generally not a Nicholas Sparks kind of gal when it comes to stories, not my thing.  I continued to read, to spite that feeling.Now that I've finished, I am so utterly happy to have made the journey and I'll say, maybe even lucky to have done so.  What I got from this wonderful story was such incredible thankfulness for life and friends and family and my simple, but life-fulfilling love of books and my own unique view of the world.What runs through this book as a thread, a beating, thriving heart - is love.  The love we feel as human beings for children, parents, lovers, friends, the world in our eyes and stories.  It is woven so skillfully, so thoughtfully.  I read so many books and they make me feel many emotions, but most internally.  This book on the other hand made me smile so many times, made me laugh out loud and yes, cry out loud, but not for the reasons I assumed when I first began reading.I am an instant fan of John Green.  He doesn't play with words, he guides with them.  He chooses them perfectly, he doesn't go too lightly or too heavy.  It is like the baby bear's porridge in the Three Bears, just right.  There are so many thoughtful moments in the book, so many times for us to reflect on the world, on our family, our own thoughts and feelings.  This kind of book brings something to the reader and those books I find great value in.I cannot recommend this book enough.  It is the reason books exist and should always exist, they can reveal and therefore, enlighten, the human heart."
5," This is the first John Green book that I've read and not sure I really understand the nerdfighting discussions, but I enjoyed it enough to give the author another shot.The book is witty and fun, even with the impending doom that is lurking in the background (protagonists are dying from the beginning).I really enjoyed that it didn't (not much of a spoiler here...) have a happy ending, although I think more and more books are turning to the more realistic endings without always having a happy finale.Both Hazel and Gus made me laugh at times - the interaction between them and the poking fun at the Literal Heart of Jesus just didn't get old to me!  And even though others mentioned it being annoying, I really enjoyed the cigarette discussion of not allowing the killing mechanism its power to kill.What I didn't love was that the characters seemed unrealistic to me.  They weren't believable as teenagers.  I will take the argument that if you are a teenager that has known they were dying for years, maybe there's a maturity elevation that happens more quickly than the norm, but I really wasn't able to really get drawn into their personalities.  Along the same line, I felt the love story was too forced.  I didn't fall for either of them, and never felt their love for each other.  I think it needed to be a bit deeper of an emotional connection for them.The other part that left me with a bad taste in my mouth was the Van Houten character.  His final backstory was very predictable, and his personality was quite artificial.  I feel like Green needed something bigger than dying to form the plot around, and I understand that, but adding this extraneous author character in - especially the 2nd time he shows up - was weak writing.  The story behind Van Houten left me with no sense of closure.  And (now a little more of a spoiler...) the ending with the Eulogy written by Gus and sent to him was silly.  Gus would know that by his terribly miserable character, he wouldn't do what was asked of him by re-writing it.  Gus, if so in love, would have left that directly for Hazel's parents to find or Hazel herself to find.  He wouldn't have mailed it to Amsterdam to be unnoticed and scoffed at - they knew that he was a heartless man at that point in his life.I wrote a lot of bad, but please note that I did still like the book a lot, but wish that there were fewer moments that felt forced.  But even through those, it was a memorable story of love and life and self-realization and I will try other books of his!"
5," ~4.5/5So, I'm feeling a little unsure about this book. And so I'm not totally sure what to say about it. I feel like I kind of don't think it was amazing, but it was amazing. And there is no reason for me to not think it was amazing. Maybe it was just so much, and I'm overwhelmed and very unsure or something. Also, I feel a little biased and pressured, and like I should only say amazing things about it. But I also don't feel like there's really anything not amazing about it in the first place. And I don't really know what rating to give it. I feel like, maybe, it doesn't really deserve a 4.5, and yet it also deserves nothing less?I'm just all kinds of conflicted. (But, I swear, I'm going to be honest throughout all of this review.) (Also, I promise, I'm not going to spoil anything big in this besides general plot. So, Spoiler Free!)So I understand what John Green (I kind of want to address him as John and not Green. But that's unprofessional, isn't it? [Not that, you know, I am professional or anything.] And yet, as a Nerdfighter, that's what I always think of him as. Maybe I'll just call him John Green through all of it?) was trying to say with all of it. I get the message. And it was awesome and completely well done. And I might talk more about it later, but I don't think that's what I'm going to focus on in this review.I am going to talk about Hazel, though. Ahh, Hazel Grace. First of all, I want to say how well John did at creating a real girl. Especially because, as a (you know, mostly) normal teenage(-ish) girl, I related to her in a lot of ways. She's a bit cynical, and not all that sure of herself, and she says 'um' quite a bit and ends a lot of what she says in a question. And I love how she thinks about boys, and just living in general. And she's smart, and in college even though she's sixteen (with a completely understandable and logical reason), and she's honest (at least to herself). She's a teenager, even if she does have cancer.And, ohhh, Augustus Waters. (Also, I want to mention that I love the names John Green came up with. They are brilliant.) I don't even... But I do, I do know what to say about him. He is simply amazing. He wants to mean something, and he's fun, and he likes Hazel and doesn't see why she shouldn't know this. He's just... full of swoon. He is all swoon. There is so much swoon with him that I don't even know what to tell you besides that you have to read it to fully understand the amazing-ness that is him and Hazel, when they are together and not. And I like that the drama wasn't pumped up very much or anything. Even when they have problems (that would usually cause a big scene or something), it isn't too tense, it's not dramatic. It just is what it is.And I wasn't expecting what... happened to him, to happen to him. Especially not before her. The situation was different from what I'd expected when I started the book, and I'm glad. It turned out different, in a  very good way. Well, not very, but, you know...Also, you guys. I'd read several reviews and seen lots of people talking about it, and how it was full of all these emotions. And, since I'm not the type of person that cries at things, I was like, 'yea, okay', but my interest was piqued. And you guys, everyone was kind of right. A lot of the book is just fun and more fun, and there are a ton of cute moments between Hazel Grace and Augustus. It's much more funny than I thought it would be, like with moments of the three just joking around, which I really enjoyed. And, yea, there are several moments in the book where Hazel is by herself and thinking about things, and I enjoyed them, but I didn't think they were overwhelmingly upsetting or anything. But then. But then, you guys. A scene came up about Augustus. And I was completely caught off guard.I knew it was coming; it was obvious that it was coming. And even when it started, I was like 'aww, sad', but then, and I think I might have just put myself in Hazel's mind and imagined it for myself, but then I thought 'oh, there are tears in my eyes'. I'm not even kidding. This book brought me so close to crying, closer than anything I've read before. And it was amazing. Sad, but amazing.And then there's Isaac. He's one of their friends, who goes blind. But him and Augustus play violent video games together, and then him and Hazel play vocal video games, and he has a moment of denial and hard realization that's a bit sad (and honest, and I genuinely enjoyed it), and he's just generally awesome.We didn't see too much of anyone else's parents (although what we did see was usually pretty humorous or sad) besides Hazel's, who we saw often. She's close to both of them, and they were pretty awesome. Her dad, in particular, was so sweet, and very sensitive (and cried often). And she jokes around easily with her mom, for instance, when they take a trip with Augustus. Near the end, they got a bit pushy, but otherwise were pretty cool.Also, the subject matter. It made me a little wary, but it didn't put me off from reading it or anything, because I was much too excited for that. And I haven't even read much about people with cancer, or many novels with sick people. But he did it really well. It was (I'm assuming this, because I haven't, nor have I ever been around someone who has, experienced this,) realistic. And I'm pretty sure he knew what he was talking about, as there were several technical words and stuff thrown around, and I know that he did a lot of research (not that that he couldn't have been making it all up, though). He wasn't afraid of showing the ugly parts of it. It seemed very honest, with the way everyone reacted to it, and thought about living and dying, and how they're all treated because they're sick, like with the Perks and Support Group. (And I liked the, depression is a side effect of dying thing, in particular. There were several parts of the book that made me think, That's a nice/interesting way of looking at things. There are just so many little things that matter so much in this book.)And whole thing with Van Houten and An Imperial Affliction. That's just... hm. (Kind of messy? And a bit sad?) There's the big similarities. With the endings, for example. And it is a bit frustrating, but I get it. So, fine. Fine.The book has John Green's general way of writing. It's his style. He's a bit subtle and honest and a little dark; just him. This book included text messages and letters and little things like that. They added more character to the story, more personality to the characters. I liked it.It was good. It was amazing. It wasn't amazing. It was all of the things and not, all at the same time. But aside from all that, I really enjoyed it, maybe even loved it, and I would suggest it.[P.S. Thank you, John Green for creating this book with such amazing characters. And, also, for signing so very many of them. I appreciate it. (I appreciate you.) (Best Wishes.)]"
5," Get your affairs settled, pets walked, food made, fave shows set up on DVR, because once you begin reading you will NOT want to stop, for anything.I have heard mixed things about John's other books (Looking for Alaska &amp; Paper Towns) so when presented with the opportunity to read this I have to admit I was NOT expecting such a phenomenal novel.As with all new books I get, I skimmed a few pages, unlike the OTHER books I did NOT stop skimming until it was 430am!I wish I could emotionally detach &amp; look at this book &amp; review it constructively. This story will do everything to your emotions, BUT make them detached.Hazel &amp; Augustus are teenagers, obviously destined to be lovers &amp; best friends, and meant to die long before they normally should.A cruel twist of fate drags them together. The Cancer Kids Support Group.Before you think this will be a dreary &amp; sad book bout cancer &amp; kids that die from it, please think again. While cancer is in their lives it has not taken them over. We are not bored to tears with medical lingo &amp; incessant chatter of chemo &amp; it's side effects.A few medical conversations take place, but they add to the story not control it.As we live through their eyes &amp; become immersed in their story we cheer for them. We know there will be no unrealistic OMG THEY FOUND A CURE FOR THIS RARE CANCER moments &amp; I respect the author for not insulting our intelligence by even leading us to think it is possible.We want Hazel &amp; Augustus &amp; their friend Isaac to live the best life they can, while their health allows it.We want to support them &amp; be there for them. That's all we can realistically do.Isaac is a mutual friend, also from Cancer Kids Support Group. His story line adds depth to the overall story. He shows us how these kids act when a cure for cancer doesn't always mean a stereotypical happy ending &amp; how sometimes sacrifices must be made to save a life.It's easy to see how friendships forged under these circumstances are so strong &amp; true, as fleeting as they may be. They truly learn to take it one day at a time &amp; to appreciate ALL life has to offer. From a sunrise to petting a kitten to playing a video game with your best friends.Hazel is taken on a vacation with Augustus that changes her life in so many ways it makes you dizzy with emotion.I was introduced to what seemed to be a strong supporting character &amp; his role was chopped to hell. Peter Van Houten, the alcoholic author they went to Amsterdam to visit. His role confused me a bit. I understood where John Green went, at the end of the story, but Peter Van Houten could of been a stronger, stable, side character. He was such an integral part of the story &amp; was kinda wishy washy when it came down to it.The other small gripe I had was that these young kids had Dawson's Creek syndrome. Sometimes they spoke a bit too mature for even bright 16 &amp; 17 year old kids.Despite a few small fly in the ointment type annoyances this novel had me engrossed from beginning to end.Hazel &amp; Augustus (Isaac's too) parents were simply awesome. They were what you would imagine a family in their position to be like. Staying strong together in front of their child &amp; crying like helpless babies together behind closed doors, waking up &amp; doing it all again. I liked that, I liked seeing they were human &amp; felt the stress &amp; helplessness &amp; unfairness of it all. It was real. Too real.This novel will definitely invoke strong emotions in us all. We will rage at the cruelty of cancer yet be glad for every single moment of happiness Hazel, Gus, &amp; Isaac have. Together &amp; apart. Isaac was a supporting character but he really struck a chord with me. I keep mentioning him because IMHO he WAS the strongest of them all.We think we know where each character will end up, but we don't. John Green has truly crafted a story that will play itself out in your memory long after you close the book.The Fault in Our Stars starts with cancer &amp; ends with life"
2," bought TFIOS in one of the stores where their tour will be, and mine was, alas, unsigned. Good news for me is that I had, on the ride to the store, seen the description of what to do if it's NOT signed in the book release video on their channel (vlogbrothers). In short, email the author at sparksflyup(at)gmail(dot)com and give the following information:1)Your name2)Your address3)Where you bought the bookIt may be a good idea to take a photo of your receipt or a quick low-res flip through of the blank pages before the book starts... but the where you got it is very important on the distributor end; the problem is a distributor problem. He did sign 150k pages to go in the front of the book... but some of the distributors apparently failed to include them when binding the final product together--my guess is they printed them prematurely (it's obviously a bad idea to try printing everything in one place then shipping thousands of miles when you can print a hundred miles from major hubs instead)... He's fixing the problem; just Keep calm and DFTBA and you'll be rewarded for awesome.The book... well, 223 people have already said what I could and more. What I WILL say is that it is NOT simply a children's book and should not be limited to something-kids-read... Sure, I enjoy DFW and Vonnegut (Kurt, not the cousin twice removed who did Gods of Greenwich). That does not make this any less a great book for anyone ~15 and up than it makes all the classics we happened to read in grade school. While much of the content is modern (the Internet exists in his works; somehow America's Next Top Model got mentioned without any odd copyright blockage; this isn't a Moulin Rouge story where someone simply suffers-modern drugs/hospital facilities are part of the routine), there are layers of depth that defy calling this kid's fiction or temporary pop literature that will be forgotten in 100 years. Like the works of Gaiman, I truly hope this isn't forgotten, as it's the most honest look I've seen at the subject matter but despite lives revolving around cancer, the story is not strong because of how it tackles cancer.TFIOS is strong because of what John Green's just-plain-GOOD-at, creating characters you care deeply about. It doesn't make you cry just to make you cry or force laughter, either. The main characters are fleshed out so well that you laugh and cry because you're sucked into their world and get it at any given moment, whatever the it may be. You could read it, not emotionally attach to the characters, and still say, Wow, that was really well-done because it IS well-done. However, you more than likely will find yourself genuinely liking and connecting with the characters. What I appreciate most (and other oldies like me that have read it and talked with me about it have agreed on this point) is that despite being far, far older than the protagonists, I'm not reading it from the outside; I'm not simply connecting with the pain of the parents or the quirky beautiful connection Hazel and her father share from quite early on. I connect more with the youth and again this comes down to a strength, a conscientious effort, in Green's writing: he honors youth instead of simplifying them. He doesn't dumb down their experiences, whether they are trivial, serious, light, or exasperating. He keeps them genuine and doesn't talk down to his readers or tell the story's importance TO you. He lets every reader, from the youngest to the oldest, find the meaning themselves; he doesn't frustrate with the annoyance of things like explaining every bit of history you might not know--he lets you get interested and look it up yourself. This book deserves full engagement and will get a couple more reads by me before winter's up, as I know there is much that, despite taking my time reading, I want to delve further into (well, what isn't purely fictional). This book is worth owning, and I say that as someone who has taken to donating my funds to the library and reading materials then sending them back to be shared by any and all. I'm glad I bought two copies, not just for the two tickets to the event, either... This will be an extremely special gift, and if someone you know does enjoy reading novels, this is one book I give a very rare 5 stars and full endorsement (if they enjoyed The Hunger Games, another I don't think is JUST young adult friendly, the way people care about Katniss/Gale/etc is how I can best sum up how they'll care about Hazel/Augustus/etc)."
5," just finished reading this book. Like not even five minutes ago, so the emotion is raw and exposed. This story is breath taking, and if you're reading this thinking that this book will just be some sappy romance, you've got it wrong my friend. John Green doesn't take us into another world, he takes deeper into our ours. I loved this book because of its truth. It's not sugar coated, and I loved that. I mean, when you sugar coat  the truth, it's not the truth anymore. It's a lie. So, by reading this, I can truthfully tell you that every emotion of mine was brought out. I saw the world in the eyes of someone who was deep, thoughtful, and thought provoking. That person was Hazel Grace Lancaster. Hazel has terminal cancer, and she spent most of her time thinking about death, before Augustus Waters. Augustus is a fun, lovable character that I instantly fell in love with. These two characters are brought together at a support group, and Augustus is there supporting his friend Isaac, who has to get surgery and will be permanently blind afterwards. That's just the beginning. As you read this, you will be taken through an adventure that contains love, hope, loss, survival, laughter, etc. I recommend this to every person. Not just teenagers, but EVERYONE. I really did learn something from this novel. Right  now, I just have this sense that I'm suddenly completely aware that I'm alive, well, and breathing. Before this book, it didn't seem like such a big deal, but now it is because I know that some  people don't and will never have that sense of comfort. I am so completely aware of how lucky I am now. Read this novel. You won't ever forget this. I know I won't. Five stars is the highest I can go, but I say infinity stars."
5," this was my first and possibly last YA novel. i took the word of another middle-aged woman and ordered it. while i admit that i did get sucked into the storyline, and even cried a couple times (partially attributed to hormone imbalance, i suspect,) the pretentious language of practically all the characters drove me crazy. i guess the worst part of this experience was the relentless hammering of Meaning and Deep Thoughts . completely heavy-handed and overwrought. better to say less than too much, would be my advice to the author. but he will never take it because there are thousands of kids and other readers out there giving him 5 stars.as a mother of girls 12 and 14, i was totally bummed when hazel and gus had sex. i cannot hand this book over to my girls anytime soon because of this. (and they might have actually enjoyed this book.) i can only imagine the conversation about the sexual encounter going something like, well....i guess if you are BOTH dying of cancer any day and you don't have to worry about pregnancy and STD's, you can have sex. but ONLY then!i wish YA authors would understand that when they write teen sex, 16-year old girls think they have some kind of endorsement for it. from the author, from the characters they admire. permission and encouragement, given to them from someone who doesn't even know them, care about them or love them. i will return back into the world of adult fiction and not look back, thanks to the fault of this overly-written book."
5," This is my first John Green book, and I only wish I had found this author sooner. This book did so much more then entertain me and take my mind from reality for awhile. The characters were incredible. Hazel is dripping with sarcasm, witty,beyond intelligent, and comes across as an old soul. I feel John Green did an incredible job of creating such a complex character that was quite believable, considering what she was going through. Augustus Gus, was old mature beyond his years, yet still written extremely well. The story line of teenagers facing terminal cancer is not one I would readily jump to read, but I am so happy I did. I laughed, I cried,I felt the heartbreak, and the emotional roller coaster the story takes you on. I finished the story wanting to start from the beginning and 're-read it again, because it left such an impression on me. I think this novel should be expanded and not placed in just the YA genre. As a 45 year-old woman, I would recommend this book to anyone that believes in true love, for anyone that believes in hope and beauty, for anyone that believes in life is an experience that cannot always turn out as a happy ending, but it is well worth the journey. I hope this book becomes one that will be given in schools as those on reading lists for students. I believe this book will be a significant contribution to literature in years to come. Thank you for such a wonderful, poignant, beautiful love story that transcends life and death. Happy I read this, and will read it again. Definitely one of those books that you go back to and read again, because it's that good."
3," So....I finished The Fault in Our Stars, and even though I had already predicted the ending(I have a bad habit of that....) it still was a shock. It's one of those endings that's terrible on the narrator that makes you want to smack the author for doing it. But....it's real. Truth is, life isn't full of happy endings. Life sucks, people get sick, and people die. And John Green portrayed this fact perfectly in The Fault in Our Stars.I've heard people complain that it's unrealistic. I seriously can't understand HOW it's unrealistic. I personally found it to be very honest and real. It's probably one of the most honest books I've read in a LONG time. Moving on to another complaint I've heard. 'Guys shouldn't write from a girl's Point of View.'. I'll admit, I was a bit worried when I found out that the book was from Hazel's point of veiw, and not third person. The only time I've ever read a book that was written by a guy, in a girl's POV, it was straight out bad. John Green has proven that you CAN successfully write in the POV of the opposite gender.Yes, this is a sad book, but there's alot of comedy in there too. I laughed for 10 solid minutes towards the end of the book. My chest hurt, my eyes were watering, and I couldn't breathe all because of on little page. Even thinking about it now gets me laughing.All in all, I suggest this to anyone who likes to read. It's honest, heartfelt, and true to the core. Maybe it doesn't have wizards from a foreign land, or vampires that sparkle, but it's an amazing book that deserves a chance to be loved by someone."
5," didn't like this book. The characters didn't ring true to me. They were overly precocious and basically unlikable. A little too cool for school. I found myself instead of deeply reading passages of their rants, I would say out loud Blah, blah, blah. I kept reading hoping it would get better but it really didn't. It was overly wordy in some places but not enough detail in other places to keep my interest. I didn't know Greens target audience was young adults, so for this old women and cancer survivor, I couldn't relate."
5," read this because it was a choice of my book group. Despite all the hype, I didn't enjoy it. Many books in the young adult category cross over and work well for all ages, but not this one. It's definitely geared towards very young teens. The characters are not believable, any of them, and I found myself not caring about them, despite the obvious intent of the author to raise huge amounts of sympathy in his readers."
1," The Fault in Our Stars is profound in its unflinchingly honest portrayal of young people living with cancer. I was moved and my eyes were opened to an experience that is alien to me. The beauty of Green's writing is that he was able to tell the story of children and cancer without making a depressing book. It was tragic at times, but it was also sardonic, witty, romantic, and intelligent. The characters were not saints but regular people who happened to have cancer. I fell deeply in love with the two protagonists, Hazel and Gus. Sometimes I forgot how young they were because they ruminated and bantered in ways far beyond their years. In any other story, it would have been unrealistic. But, in this story, it was a logical side-effect of cancer. Face to face with mortality at an age when most consider themselves invincible, the characters would naturally think more on death and religion and life's true meaning than the average teenager. They weren't necessarily wiser, just more cognizant. I hope young people will find and read this book. It isn't the paranormal or dystopian fantasy that so many teenagers gravitate toward, but it is very real and gut-wrenching, dramatic and funny. This book will resonate with me for a very long time, and I highly recommend it. Note: The novel does contain language and sexuality that might make it inappropriate for younger teens."
1,"ve never read anything by Mr. McDougal before, but this is an amazing book. John Green can only hope to aspire to the power of this book that has his name on the front. If anyone knows where to locate any more work by Mr. McDougal, it will be very helpful. I now have Don't Forget to Be McDougal tattooed several places on my body because of the impact this book had on me."
5, Holt McDougal is a really great author.  He kind of reminds me of the guy who wrote Looking For Alaska.
2,"t may be a tour de force for the author to speak from a girl's point of view, but he flunks in speaking from a kid's point of view.  How many video game playing 16 year olds rap about Shakespeare, T.S. Eliot, William Carlos Williams . . . .  And she didn't even go to high school."
5," heard so many good things about this book; it even won the Abraham Lincoln High School Reader's Choice Award. The story is a great attempt by a male adult author to write about the way a teenage girl with cancer diagnoses deals with her situation. The story was interesting. But as I read, the author seemed to communicate one thing to the readers while he had the characters do the opposite, which I found frustrating. Maybe that's the point, but I didn't enjoy it.And for trying to give a realistic glimpse into a life some wouldn't otherwise understand, I thought the characters presented a lot of pseudo-knowledge and even misconceptions. This was what ruined the book for me. To be fair, the main characters are teenagers, which increases the possibility that they believe misconceptions because they're so young. And perpetuating misconceptions is a pet peeve of mine. Other readers may be just fine with the information the characters represent, even though they know it's slightly distorted. I just hope readers know better than to take everything the readers say and do as realistic.Overall: Great book for teenagers to step into the life of someone with cancer as long as they take its contents with a grain of salt."
2," got my copy the day after release and finished it same day!  It was a fantastic book (but in the lyrics of Hank Green, it wasn't Harry Potter) and i am already going through it a second time, cause i am that odd.  I am also hunting for a Hanklerfish or Yeti, mine was neither (it was signed in green however, one down!).  Now the book did not make me cry, as sad as parts were, and i think the reason was John did a fantastic job bringing Hazel and the others to life.  I knew Hazel wouldn't want pity, so i didn't.  I loved Hazel's view on having cancer, and while she did act so teenagery sometimes, which honestly she should, it didnt make me dislike her any less.  Loved Gus as well, especially the Christmas Tree line (i dont think this is spoilery cause if you havnt read it, you shouldnt know what this is.) and his laid back goofy attitude at the whole cancer thing.  I was also smiling at a few locations mentioned that i've seen in vlogbrother videos.  It did remind me of Looking For Alaska a tiny bit, but whos to say that is bad?  (just reminded me of the before and after, the stories are nothing alike)Overall, thank you John for such a wonderful read, and thank you to everyone who helped him make it great!  DFTBA and Best Wishes!"
2," This is only more evidence that America needs a catharsis. Plot development? An attempt, just an attempt at characterization? This is dreck, and if you gag on it, there is something to be said for your taste in literature."
5," didn’t like this book. I’m an adult, but I had heard a lot of buzz around it and knew there was a movie coming out, so I decided to read it. Other than that I knew nothing about it or the author until I finished reading it. As others have mentioned, this is written in the voice of the author. All of the characters have the exact same personality, and none of them develop enough for me to really care what happens to them. I had heard this novel was so sad, such a tearjerker, but it didn’t elicit any emotion from me, probably because the characters felt so unauthentic and unrealistic. The worst part of this book was probably when they went to Amsterdam. It was so incredibly boring and the scenes with the author were lacking. Not one part of it was believable. I can’t believe John Green went to Amsterdam and spent time there and then this is what he wrote – a generally awful and terrible dull advertisement for the city.I could go on but I won’t. It’s just hard to believe that this has created so much hype. It doesn’t live up to it at all."
1," Short version: this is a Nicholas Sparks story for teens. The most noticeable feature to me is the author's characterization of the main characters. Meet Hazel and Augustus, two teens who have the emotional maturity, acumen and vocabulary of two 35 year old literature professors. Another reviewer well said: this is what Green does: he creates characters that talk like, well, middle-aged men—characters who have the philosophical background, verbal expression, and vocabulary of people much older than them. The adult doctors, nurses and parents bumble around in the background of the teenagers' firm grasp on life, pain and death. Green expertly gives teenagers a world in which they imagine themselves to be--a world in which they have come to understand the Meaning of Life, and they patiently abide the adorable, sometimes infuriating, attempts by adults to impart wisdom."
2, didn't think the book was well written - it dragged on and on without interest. I agree life for children living with cancer is heart breaking but the story line was very thin and predictable. It was a wasted read for me.
2," Had I not been desperate for something to read that was reasonably priced, I would have paid more attention to the fact this this book was written for teens. I am way out of the teen market and did realize this book was about teens but thought it was written for an adult state of mind. I did read this book and finish it but was greatly disappointed in the stilted dialogue and corny plot. There are some children's books that I'd still love today, A Secret Garden, for example which is so richly written with a fascinating plot and characters worth remembering. I'll be curious to see what they do with the motion picture of this book but from what I've seen the characters in the film don't resemble the ones in this book. Next time I'll be much more careful when choosing a book that I'd probably love."
1," Why I Picked It UpOkay, to be honest, the reason I picked this novel up and actually read it was because my friends had read it and basically forced it upon me. I had been eyeing it, of course, because of all of the hype surrounding it. But I actually picked it up at the force of my friends’ hands.PlotThe plot of The Fault in Our Stars is a well known one: the two cancer patients, one terminal, one in remission. The love of all loves. The tears that accompany those who dare pick up and read such a sad book. So I’m not going to take the time to spell it out for you. The plot of the novel wasn’t the kicker with this novel. The point of this novel was the feels. The feels you feel when you read about these poor kids suffering from such illnesses.OtherSince I’ve read this novel, I have been referred to as heartless by the teenagers in my school who think that they are avid “readers” just because they’ve read this novel. That being said, I didn’t blubber like a baby when I read this novel. I didn’t shed a tear. Was it sad, the situation these characters were in? Of course it was. Unlike the accusations I’ve faced, I am not heartless. I am just desensitized to many things that occur in a hospital setting. I want to be a surgeon, a trauma brain surgeon, so I can’t be that affected by things like death. I will see it frequently in the future. That being said, maybe it was the fact that I knew what was going to happen in the novel. But I am quite certain that that is not what it is. The simple explanation is that it did not tug on my heartstrings like it does so many others. That may make me unsympathetic, unfeeling, or any other word that people may thing to describe me after this. But it is how I felt and there is no amount of words that people can call me that will change the fact that this book did not make me cry.Leading Lady“There will come a time when all of us are dead. All of us. There will come a time when there are no human beings remaining to remember that anyone ever existed or that our species ever did anything. There will be no one left to remember Aristotle or Cleopatra, let alone you. Everything that we did and built and wrote and thought and discovered will be forgotten and all of this will have been for naught. Maybe that time is coming soon and maybe it is millions of years away, but even if we survive the collapse of our sun, we will not survive forever. There was time before organisms experienced consciousness, and there will be time after. And if the inevitability of human oblivion worries you, I encourage you to ignore it. God knows that’s what everyone else does.”Now that that rant is over, I can talk about the characters. Hazel’s character just did not do in for me. She sounded like some 50-60 year old professor with the vocabulary that girl was throwing. I know, I know, she’s wise and worldly because she is a terminal cancer patient and all. But I don’t find that true. I’ve seen terminally ill patients during my internship at the hospital this past year, and no one there reminded me of Hazel. But regardless of that fact, she was a very well written character. I don’t really have any more opinions on her simply due to the fact that I could not relate to her character at all.Leading Male“‘I’m in love with you,’ he said quietly. ‘Augustus,’ I said. ‘I am,’ he said. He was staring at me, and I could see the corners of his eyes crinkling. ‘I’m in love with you, and I’m not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things. I’m in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we’re all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we’ll ever have, and I am in love with you.”’”Augustus Waters. He, on the other hand, I adored. He was charming and sweet and funny and romantic. He wasn’t my favorite book boy (le gasp!) but he was okay. View Spoiler »ConclusionThe Fault in Our Stars was not a bad novel by far. It wasn’t the best novel, or the saddest novel, but it was well written, engaging, and it was an overall good read. Although it didn’t live up to the extremely high expectations that I had set, it is still one that I can whole-heartedly recommend. I was one of the few that didn’t absolutely die over love for this novel, and that is fine. I know many people love it, and I’m sure if you give it a try you would too. It just wasn’t the best one for me."
5,"m sorry to say this but I found this book to be overrated. Before I read it, I heard a lot of positive things about it. For months and months, my friends would remind me that it was one of their favorite books, that they highly recommend it, that it's written beautifully, it made them cry, etc. I'm not sure if my expectations were too high but anyway! I drove to the B&amp;N, bought it, and read it in two days. However, I read the first half the day I bought it, then months went by and I never even bothered to finish it. But I don't like reading a book half finished, so I read the last half and I thought it was grossly overrated. I don't know if this makes me a bad person for not liking a book about two people falling in love, who happen to be sick. I thought the writing was maybe too shallow and/or simple. I know I'm a guy, but that doesn't mean I don't like reading a tearjerker every once-in-a-while. Hell! I read The Hunger Games and thought it was incredible! No comparison but it's safe to say, this is one book I cannot stand. I usually never say this, but for once, the movie actually looks like it can exceed the book.The only thing I found interesting was Augustus and his views of society and the way he decided to live. For example, the character puts a cigarette in his mouth but he doesn't give it the power to kill him even more, he doesn't light it. As he says, It's a metaphor! I thought that was genius!In conclusion, whether the book was too simple or shallow or depressing, I did not like it! The fact that the writing seemed like it was written by a 13 year-old probably had a lot to do with it. Now I know I should be the last person to comment on English and Grammar, but I'm not an author, nor do I plan to be one. Seriously, dedicate two to three days at B&amp;N and read it there, don't buy it, you might not like it!"
2," ok, so this book is really dramatic but the author writes it in a weird way.I mean, the writing is so cheap and tacky, as if a teenager wrote it.I cant believe that every 16 year old is all like omg omg im crying!The romance=disgusting because its weird and inappropriate for children.No way its a bestseller.This book should've not even been published.By the way I would recommend the maze runner series way better.Maze runner is awesome"
1, This book was disappointing after all of the hype. This just felt like another version of A Walk  to Remember.
1," What can I say about this book.............That I cried for hours after finishing it, or that I learned a lesson about this amazing thing called LIFE?  To think how many people go through life without the chance to fall in love with a person that understands them for who they are, and for now what they are, I feel sorry for them.  Hazel and Augustus are two people that you cannot help feel sorry for, from the first page on, but their story of love, hope and their appreciation for life is one not to be missed! Be ready though, if you remember Erich Segal's Love Story from the early 70's, this makes that story very mild, have many, many many tissues ready.  Read it!"
2," This book was actually way too cheesy and I don't understand what all of the hype was about. I wanted to like his book, but I just couldn't get past the cheese factor"
5," John Green has a decent way of portraying relationships and writing dialogue: though not entirely realistic, both are able to affect readers and make them sympathize with the characters and their situation.Although I couldn't consider reading this book a total waste of time, I found it was entirely forgettable. Perhaps a good term for it would be light reading, which is definitely not what you want this book to be because it deals with death, sickness, and the tragically short existence of human beings.All in all, it was an OK effort on Green's part but it fails to pull readers into the story, and leaves no lasting impressions."
1," can't believe I pour myself through the torture of reading books I know will have a sad ending. But I do it over and over, and I will continue to do so if only to absorb the beautiful deaths of my fictitious loved ones. To the people who say this book was bad and not about cancer, I hate to sound portentous, but you're completely mistaken. So what if it's not about cancer? Cancer isn't the bad guy...it just wants too be alive as John Green beautifully illustrated in this novel. I fell in love with Augustus Waters, and I may just have to read this book again. Maybe it's my version of Hazel' s favorite novel."
3," Before I started this book, I had this thought that I might not like this book. Which was crazy because I saw all of these glowing reviews of it on Amazon and Goodreads and I thought it might not live up to my high expectations. (If you go read some of them, almost everybody cried at some point while reading it.) Now that I finished it I think it's my favorite John Green book ever. (Sorry Paper Towns) It was so amazing that I'm afraid if I continue to write a review about it, that I'm going to spoil it for somebody. So I have to stop writing. now. So you can go discover why I love this book so much."
5, Good story but didn't  care for the authors style of writing.  Would not buy any more of his books
5," The author writes well and some would believe real.  But I would not go out of my way to read something so without hope.  Yes, these things happen all the time, but the main character is so depressing and morbid, why read it at all.  Someone with cancer reading this may well think what's the use.  I would prefer someone who at least has some semblance of hope or at least some quality of life.  The main character in this book didn't even enjoy her first time sexual encounter.  I wouldn't want a young person reading this to think there is nothing beautiful in life.  Nothing to look forward to."
5," This book was such a disappointment.  After all the hype I had to read it.  I started it four three different times and only made it a few chapters before finally committing to it (because I heard so many good things about it).  If you are a Debbie Downer this is most definitely the book for you.  If you want to read an entire book focused on terminally ill teenagers this is the book for you.  It was so depressing (and not in the really deep story that makes you cry kind of way), it was poorly written and it was just a drag - plain and simple.  There was so much filler in this book (ridiculous details about video game play and useless things like that).  At chapter 20, I finally gave up and skipped ahead to the final chapter just to be done with it.  Honestly, not my cup of tea but, soooo many people loved it so it must just be me!"
2,"nitially, I approached The Fault in Our Stars with excitement having heard so much about it, but that quickly fell apart and I assure you that it's not because too-high expectations. It was just bad. The novel is essentially a love story between two cancer kids. Green does his best to keep his style unadorned and create a specific voice for Hazel, the protagonist. We get the picture: she needs an oxygen tank to breathe and she's best friends with her Mom. And while her life is not what anyone hopes for, Green uses humor to keep the novel from being of the overly sentimental variety. Okay. But from there, things fall off. How you ask?1. Augustus Waters is completely contrived from the dialogue to his need for metaphors. He is essentially a cardboard cut-out of a dreamy teenage boy.2. Green uses a novel both Hazel and Augustus read as a crutch to support their love story.3. The third act's step away from realism or simple plausibility shows way too much conscious effort.4. Hazel's voice is inconsistent and tiring after 300 pages.I don't recommend this. I'm sure there are better cancer stories out there. With this one, You'll rip through it and wonder why you even bothered in the first place."
1," loved this often bittersweet story of teenagers with cancer. The dialogue is great and the characters grew on me even more as I read along.  The relationships are well-written and it won't be easy to forget the book or the characters for a long time. This is the first of John Green's books I've read, but I'd like to read more by him. This book will appeal to young adults but it really is for all ages to enjoy.The humor is well-placed in the dialogue and there isn't really anything I didn't like about this literary novel.  Highly recommended."
2," What on Earth is all the fuss about this book? The characters are pretty much unbelievable and mostly not at all appealing.  The story is highly improbable.  The most authentic aspects are the descriptions of the disease process and the parents' reactions to impending and actual death.  This story felt more like an updated remix of the tear-jerker Love Story from the early 70's...melodramatic and maudlin. Mercifully, it was a quick read.  I'd suggest seeing the movie, but I can't encourage prolonging the life of this blather in any circumstance."
5," So I wanted to love this book about star crossed teens, but their personalities made it difficult. I am a smart person and knows my smart people and no one speaks the way these two teenagers speak. Although I shed many tears reading this novel, I did so more for the memories of a loved one that passed away from a long battle with cancer than from the relationship between the characters. This is a poignant novel about cancer and death and loss, but as for relationships, the writer misses the mark by a long shot."
2," This book is the saddest, happiest, funniest book I have ever read. It has a sad ending that made me cry, but when I read the beginning and middle I could not stop smiling. If i could find love that strong I would be the happiest person alive. If that person left I would be the saddest. This book has perspective of both sides. It will teach you a lesson on love, hate, empathy, sympathy, and friendship. I would recommend this book for ages 11-16 as I am age 11. I could not put this book down. Neither will you!"
2, John; I understand you don't write for the older readers and target younger readers. However as an older reader that has enjoyed all of your work and is a proud nerdfighter. I must say this is one of your all time best works. I hope that I will have a chance to speak to you again in Chicago next August. Your writing always touchs my heart and I know anyone that buys your audio book will be deeply touched by this story.Thank you for looking deep inside my heart and telling this amazing story.Jeff
5," My problem with this book is that as  a cancer survivor, I met a totally different bunch of cancer patients around me. All of them, including me, were basically brave, cheerful and in a strange, unexplainable way, peaceful. These kids are stuffed with a precocious form of cynicism and - sorry - arrogance, implying: we are so special because we are the doomed. For me this is a cliche that has nothing to do with the Real Thing, and frankly, I am glad that it doesn't.Thus, only 2 stars."
5," All of them. The Fault in Our Stars was was on John Green's finest works, and in the time I spent reading the book I sobbed, I smiled, I laughed, and then I sobbed again.Though in some aspects it mirrored John's previous novels (<a class=a-link-normal href=/Looking-for-Alaska/dp/0142402516>Looking for Alaska</a>,<a class=a-link-normal href=/An-Abundance-of-Katherines/dp/0142410705>An Abundance of Katherines</a>), it was in every way its own storySome dismiss this book before reading it because they claim  can't handle a story about a girl with terminal cancer. The Fault in Our Stars is much more a poignant take on the human experience than it is a book about cancer.Buy this book. Buy it for your friend, your neighbor, your parents, your niece, nephew or child. This book is one for the ages."
2, was really excited to read this book. I had heard great things about it. I work at a pediatric hospital and many of my coworkers had read it. I will admit that I read the book in about 3 days. It was hard to put down but throughout it I found myself annoyed with the characters more than anything. I did appreciate some of the struggles/stereotypes that they talked about that cancer kids deal with. I just felt that the characters complained/whined/made fun of everything. Everyone said they cried reading this book and I didn't even come close to shedding a tear. I think I was just annoyed and ready to be finished with it. It just didn't live up to the hype for me.
5," laughed, became angered, but most of all cried. Screw The Notebook, THIS is the true tale of love and loss of this generation. To warn you, the last four chapters will make you cry more than when you probably cracked your phone screen that one time at band camp. Not only is John Green the master of modern romance tales but also he makes Hazel and Augustus's love  trueand believable one. I cannot tell you how much you HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK. 100x HELL YES!!!"
2," After hearing so many good things about this book, I thought it would be the best book (or at least one of the best books) I ever read. But, alas, it was just another romance book , a chick flick. There were no funny parts, no emotionl moments. This book is proof of what a disappointing species we humans have become. I mean, crying over fictional characters? Yes, this book might be good to someone who likes romance, but for someone who likes The Lord of the Rings, it is horrible. The most action was when Gus and Hazel had sex. Maybe I read the wrong book. Or maybe, I just listened to to the wrong people. This book was a waste of my time and money."
5, This is buy far one of the worst books I have ever read. What even was that absolute garbage. John Green has no idea what its actually like to be a teenager. This book is so unrealistic I thought I was reading a book about 18th century seniors. These kids are so pretentious and so not likeable I spent the entire novel wishing they would both die as soon as possible. putting a cigarette in your mouth and not smoking it is not a metaphor its stupid.
1, This was a heart-breakingly beautiful love story about two teens that brought tears to my eyes. I originally saw the motion picture first which had me bawling my eyes out. So I had to get the novel which made me bawl even more. I can't tell much without giving away spoilers. But what I can say is that it is a great book that'll give you a different perspective on life and just how precious it is to cherish each moment we have on this earth.
1,"ve been hearing about this book for quite a while on good reads.99% of my friends gave this five stars.I think I went in with extremely high expectations and this turned out to be just ok for me.I've checked on good reads and there are only a handful of people who agree with me.So that being said, I would not let my review deter anyone from reading this book.It just wasn't my cuppa!!!"
5," OMG This has to one of the worst books I have ever read! I mean seriously, people, just 'cause it's about sad subject matter compounded by the characters ages doesn't make it a good book. What is with all the five star ratings? I just don't get it.NO, and I mean none that I know on this vast planet of ours, teenagers talk like this. Hell I'm 30 and I barely have such depth in my conversations - ever! C'mon. It reminds me of a literary version of Dawson's Creek. Only adding to the usual teenage angst, the author decided, to really get the extra punch, he'd throw in a little tug-at-your-heart-strings-illness. And Kudos, he succeed, cause the majority of the population love this over-written book.Hazel has to be the most un-likeable protagonist I've ever encountered. She bitches at her parents, she bitches at Gus. She bitches at everything in general. And yeah, okay, I get it. She's got more on her plate than most teenagers. But I hate that her Cancer is used as a tool (albeit it a poignant one) to drive the weak plot, rather than an emotional connection to the distress that Cancer causes.Now, Gus I actually liked. Although I'm not sure why since he entertained Hazel's bullsh!t from day one. The scene with the cigarette, I mean really? Who says that to someone they know all of five seconds?Oh and don't even get me started on that author of An Imperial Affection guy. WTF! So dragged the crap out of the plot all for a two second window of light at the end.So not to miss the whole Romeo/Juliet spin on this, I get it...can't ever be, cancer is their unfair faith. See this is the point where I want to become furious that an author has used something so devastating in its wake, so powerful in its effect on society, to drive a half-assed romance. Not okay, so not okay. Think I'll read some Shakespeare next time. Even a 500 year old guy is more in touch with teenage terminology!"
3, THEY KEEP WRITING NEGATIVE VICTIM-BASED BOOKS. LIKE PERKS OF WALLFLOWER AND THE REST OF THESE SOB STORIES.THERE ARE POSITVE TOPICS AND MEANINGFUL GROUND TO COVER. STOP WITH THE TALES OF WOE.
2, There are so many words that describe this book and the unique thoughts portrayed in it that I decided that none of them are good enough. It's more than amazing it's beautiful and insightful beyond compare. This us the best book I have ever read. It has opened hmm eyes to a new world; the truths in this book are breathtaking. I know I will never fully understand this book but I will always fully treasure it.
1," Even though the characters are wise beyond their years and exceptionally gifted, they are so likeable and realistically portrayed that I was drawn into their lives and shared their passions. I am by no means a young adult (have not been one for decades!) but I enjoyed this book so much that all Green's books are now on my To-Read List.  Highly recommended to Young Adults of all ages.."
5," don't get the hoopla...then again, I'm not an adolescent girl, so maybe I'm not meant to.  I didn't find much to like in this book.  The plot is obviously sentimental and the characters are not very likable.  That being said, the one character I did find worthwhile was the villain in the book...at least he was complex.  I would recommend the book to teenagers (and their moms?).  They seem to adore it."
5,"nitially, I couldn't put this book down.  It had me, hook, line and sinker early on............for about half of it.  Then it just fell flat.  Plot points were spun to the point of being ridiculous and unbelievable.  When I finished I was deflated and disappointed.  Coulda been one of the memorable ones but, alas, I will only remember it as to how disappointing it was on the whole."
2, The characters in this book were so unrealistic!  They are supposed to be teenagers but sound like nerdy Harvard graduates or something.  I have never known a teenager who speaks like these characters do.  I also couldn't ever really get attached to the characters.  Even Hazel who narrates the whole book felt distant and cold.  I didn't enjoy the book and wouldn't recommend it.
3," won't spoil it for you, but this book really hits home with its message in the last chapter. It's a book that raises philosophical questions about your own life and life choices, helping us all reevaluate and accepting where we are and being thankful for the choices we have made and/or inspired to make better choices. A great easy read for any preteen, teen or adult."
2, The story is tragic yet you laugh more than you cry.  John Green can certainly write.  I love his style and humor.  Parents beware that this is a great book but not appropriate for too young.  I would think 14-15+  I would suggest you read it to make sure and so you can discuss the mature subjects throughout.  You won't regret it - It really is a great read.
5," really wanted to love this book. I didn't. I found it very pretentious and annoying. The plot was extremely forced, in my opinion, and the teens in this book DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT talk like actual teens in this time period talk. The dialogue is very awkward and forced. Perhaps the story is nice and cute, but the execution didn't work for me one bit."
5, really liked the way it was written.  I just did not love the characters too much - I know that sounds horrible to say.  But even if you take the cancer away they are too pretentious.  I wanted to really like the book because I heard good things about it.  Maybe I am not the demographic being that it is a YA novel.  It is just missing something...
2, Three in our family read it.No one liked it. That's two seniors and one seventeen year old male. We all felt the dialogue was unrealistic. These kids were written to sound like they had PHD's in Philosophy. We all bought copies sorry to say
3," really wanted to like this book. I am not part of the John Green fandom, but even I heard about this book.This book reminded me a lot of the show Gilmore Girls and the movie Juno.  Obviously the themes are quite different, but the writing style is, to me, very similar.  The characters in these works are so clever and so brilliant that they become caricatures of themselves.  It almost felt like Gus and Hazel were playing the role of long-suffering-cancer-patient-with-attitude.  There was something so disingenuous about them that I had a hard time feeling attached to them.I also feel slightly guilty for saying this, which is odd.  It is possible to be both fighting cancer and be annoying.  I almost felt like this book was a bit of a dare:  John Green is daring us to see who is willing to say that a teenager who is suffering is also pretentious and bothersome. I am willing to take this dare.  I found Gus and Hazel to be annoying, and I think it is possible to be dealing with great suffering and still have a personality type the just doesn't click with others.That being said, I thought the relationship between Hazel and her parents was far more interesting then the relationship she had with Gus.  Honestly, I got teary at the scenes between Hazel and her father more then the scenes between Hazel and Gus."
2," can't stop crying. I just- NO. WHY John Green??? WHY?!?! Just- *wipes always tears that keep falling*Okay. I'm okay.Okay.Always.I believe something needs to be said-actually, a lot of things need to be said but I need to say this first. I totally recommend this book to be listened to instead of read. For me, I got the luxury of reading it on my kindle and listening to it but I found so many weird dance words that I couldn't pronounce so with the audiobook help, everything was much more convenient. Additionally, the narrator had a beautiful voice that was played well.Due to my incoherent mind, this review will be a rather horrible sob of mix matched words.Hazel Grace is a cogent female heroine. Beautiful, smart, relatable, strong and realistic person. John Green, you are amazingly cruel yet awesome at the same time. I hate you for many things now, but I love you for more reasons. For example, the characters you created in this book. Augustus Waters....I don't think I can say anything without leaving spoilers, and I hate spoilers so let us say that he was equally strong, and had some adorable charming features.The chemistry Hazel and Gus had was phenomenally the best I've encountered for some time. It was just so perfect and not dragging on and on. I just love them sooooo much!!Death is great. No really, if the author can properly incorporate it, it is essentially a masterpiece. The Fault In Our Stars successfully made me cry for a long time, just sobbing and wailing. If I ever find out that there was a sequel, which most likely will not happen, I'd flip out and write a one million paged rant. I have no idea where I've been these years, why didn't I read his earlier?!?!? Once again, I'm sorry guys but I don't feel quipped to write a thorough, educated/posh like review. Nevertheless, this book should not be missed."
2," then it becomes silly and unconvincing. Where is an Editor when the writer needs one? Please try again, John green."
5," There is no way that I can even attempt to write a reasonably cohesive review for this book.  As Augustus said, My thought are stars I can't Fathom into constellations. So I leave you with some random thoughts:1. This book transcends targeted reading audiences in both reading level and genre.  In other words, whatever you like to read, whether you like to read, if you haven't read this book...go read it.2. This is not a book about cancer, death, or love...this is a book about life.  And for better or worse cancer, death and love are inextricable pieces thereof.3. You will cry though out this book, so make sure you have tissues handy.4. Ironically though, most of the time, you will be smiling through the tears.5. If you are human, as I presume you all are, this book will make you view the universe differently...or rather view how you view the universe differently, or how you wish the universe would view you, or even just what exactly the universe is...6. At my ripe old age of 38, I have yet to ever re-read a book (not counting picture books read to children)...this is the first book going on my newly created To be re-read list.Source: This book was a gift from a book club friend"
2," This was just another usual teen young love book. I don't understand what the sudden crazy hype over this book is all about. It's worth reading at least once in your life, but not something to craze over about.Overall: Witty &amp; funny, but MUCH TOO overrated."
5," You will laugh. You will cry.This book will simultaneously warm and break your heart.This book arrived 3 days before Amazon said it would. I opened the package, took a moment to stare at the lovely green J Scribble in the front, and then immediately sat down on my couch and read. In the 3 and a half hours it took me to experience this novel I only got up once, and that was to move to sit in my bedroom when I realized it was about to get sad. There are no weak moments, every page is a dream. I was laughing and crying simultaneously. And when I reached the end, I was sad that the journey was over, but I did not feel the emptiness or desire Hazel and Augustus felt at the end of their fictional novel. All good things must come to an end, says the cliche, and it definitely holds true for this book. This is my favorite of John Green's novels thus far and after this success I only look forward to his next work even more."
2," Never in all my life has a book affected me the way 'The Fault In Our Stars' has. I became so enveloped with the story, the characters and their strength. After I finished reading, I felt as if I lost my best friends. The quotes in this book are fabulous as well as the lessons the characters learn. I will forever keep them with me."
5,", sadly, am not as articulate as the masterful John Green, but I will try to describe how wonderful this book is. I think the best way to describe how this book made me feel is to use what John Green said when he answered a question about how this book was supposed to make you feel: You feel all the things. I found myself, multiple times, literally laughing and sobbing at the same time. This is one of those books, you know? That you know will be a big part of you for a very long time. And I do sincerely feel that everyone would be bettered if they were to read this book."
5," There are no words for the emotional journey this book takes you on. I have rarely felt so deeply for a fictional character as I do for Hazel.Bravo John, your best yet."
5," have been a longtime fan of John Green and his other wonderful books. However, none of them quite took a hold of me like The Fault In Our Stars did. It was so incredibly moving, romantic, whimsical, tragic and honest. I fell in love with these characters within the first couple of chapters as felt for them up until the end. This book had me laughing out loud and sobbing in front of complete strangers.Fantastic job, John. You truly are a writer gifted to tell the tale of witty, loving, honest teenagers who truly make you feel something."
5," John Green is no doubt an amazing author. I went into the book with great and high expectations, I was not let down. Green snags you up, and pulls at your heart strings and makes you fall in love. It is worth the buy, I promise."
5," My original tweet:Hannah Mae @hannahmaetion10 Jan: I want to drown in this book and never come up for air. #tfios @realjohngreenJohn Green's reply:John Green @realjohngreen10 Jan: But I want you to read my next one, so don't die yet.I think that's about all I have to say."
5," tend to hate reading books about people with cancer, particularly when not written by people who have truly had the experience. I feel like, often times, these books tend to be made for the sole purpose of trying to make you try, and it tends to feel forced, and not very fun to read. This book is extremely different. I feel like John really brings his characters to life. It's so nice to read a book about a character that you truly want to be friends with. I laughed, I cried, I loved it."
5," ...Please, just read this book.It will contribute in a positive way to your experience as a human being. And no, it's not just for people who already read John Green, or who are Nerdfighters, or who are literary. Anyone can pick up this book and be lost in it nearly immediately.Not sure if you will like it?If you can answer yes to any of:Are you smart? You will like it.Are you a teenager? You will like it.Are you an adult? You will like it.Do you know what a metaphor is? You will like it.Do you feel? You will like it.Do you sometimes wish that you did not feel? You will like it.Do you wonder, in your heart sometimes, whether you are a good person? You will like it.Did you study English or Religion in school/university? You will like it.Do you think that the formal study of English or Religion has been made unnecessarily stupefyingly boring? You will like it.Do you slurp up pop culture as though it were delicious soup? You will like it.Does the exercise of relating to others confuse and sometimes terrify you? You will like it.Do you breathe? You will like it. Even if it will make you stop breathing periodically.John Green has asked that his fans post no spoilers, and so I won't. Everyone deserves to come to this book on their own terms. It makes it really hard to write a review, however, that doesn't consist of Hey, take my word on it as a totally random person off the internet whom you do not know and is totally uncredentialled - you must read this.So, instead, I'll say:Every once in awhile a book comes along that makes you wish either that it had more pages or that you were a slower reader, because you have fallen in love with it as you go along, before you even reach the end, and are worried about never being able to come new to something so good again. That's this. So, please, just read this book."
2, Okay so this is the BEST BOOK I'VE EVER READ!!! I love it so much! It's been the first book that I read in less than 3 weeks. I read it in 3 days! It is also the only book that has made me cry. It takes A LOT to make me cry! I NEVER cry especially at books and movies. Some how this book touched me in a way I didn't know a book could. It was fantastic. I don't think it has a genre because it has aspects of every single genre. I love it so much! I re read it after I finished it the first time. I've never re read a book. Thank you John Green for this wonderful book. I will never forget it. The Fault in out Stars is now my favorite book. I've never had a favorite book and now when people ask I'll say THE FAULT IN OUR STARS!!! LOVE iT! You must read it!!
5,"m not usually one for young adult fiction. Even when I was a younger adult and teenager, I prefered more sterotypically adult books, romances, horror, and fantasy (which I suppose can be argued is for any age, really. But it's not generally about teenagers and their school problems, like YA books are).But a friend of mine introduced me to John (and his brother Hank) Green's fabulous YouTube vlogs, and after a year of watching them, I decided to pre-order The Fault in Our Stars (admittedly, it was partially because I was truly impressed that he SIGNED ALL 150,000 copies of the first printing! Talk about dedication!)I foolishly had the book shipped to my school address while I was still away for winter break, so I instead read Looking for Alaska and Paper Towns. By the time I got my copy of TFiOS, I was addicted to John Green's writing. TFiOS is beautifully written. It's funny, it's quirky, and it makes you cry. It's definitely different from his previous books; for one thing, it has a female narrator, and for another, it's darker, deeper, and far more impactful. it's not his first book dealing with death, but it's the first time I've gotten so attached to the characters that, even knowing from the begining that this book probably wouldn't have the happiest of endings, I was truly sad when one of the character's dies. I had really started to feel like I KNEW these characters.I still don't think that YA fiction is my favorite genre, but I will happily continue to read anything John Green writes. I just love his style, his humor, and his way of creating characters that really feel like people I could know. TFiOS is a true masterpiece.(I also want to add that this book has made me completely fall in love with the name Augustus. It doesn't have to do with the character, it's just such a great name! I have no idea why John Green chose it, but it is absolutely perfect, and SO gorgeous...)"
5, Ever stay up to 2am sobbing and laughing your way through a novel? I feel emotionally drained and spiritually revitalized. Oh the power of well crafted literature. Thank you John Green for The fault in our stars
5," was alternating between crying my eyes out and laughing hysterically throughout the whole book. (Which, although disturbing to watch, makes this book the MOST ENGAGING READ ever.) If that wasn't enough, John Green is able to weave  words of wisdom that has the reader examining his/her own life. Yet the novel is still a truly realistic, raw story.I'm ready to read it again even though I just finished it an hour ago!"
5,"ve read every one of John's books, follow him on Facebook and watch the Vlogbrothers videos.  So I'm sure my stalker-like admiration colors my opinion, but I think this is his best book yet!  The characters are funny, smart, surprising, and very real!  Looking for a book that will wring every emotion from you?  I laughed, cried, and even yelled a couple of times.  On the surface it's a story about teens with cancer, but underneath it's really the story of two (three if you count Isaac) teenagers dealing with life in all its glory and pain -- falling in love, playing video games, fighting with parents, and dealing with the side effects of cancer.  Yes, it's inevitable that you will be brought to tears, but John's story is not manipulative or cloyingly sweet -- this is not a Hallmark movie, but everything we've come to expect from this author.  You won't be disappointed."
5," had pre-ordered my copy of TFIOS once John announced that he would be signing them. My expectations for the book were pretty high since I had already read his previous books and loved each of them equally. When I got my copy I immediately sat down that morning and started reading...I didn't stop til I was finished. This book made me laugh, cry, and hope for the future. This book not only makes you cherish the life you've been given but also gives you hope to find a love like Hazel and Augustus had. The love story of Hazel Grace Lancaster and Augustus Waters is like no other. The Fault in Our Stars is yet another amazing book written by John Green. DFTBA."
5," This was an amazing book. It was definitely a sad book; I cried more during this book than any other I've ever read, but there is a lot of humor that comes with it. The characters are wonderful and realistic.This is definite must-read not only for John Green fans but for anyone. This book doesn't have as strong language as some of his other books, which I personally liked.The Fault in Our Stars is absolutely wonderful!"
5," ...because my hanklerfish and his J-scribble friend had somehow found themselves encapsulated between the front cover and the page stuck to it. Then I read the book. Now I'm gonna read it again. I've never before sat down and READ a book, as in really delved into it and not come completely out for 30 hours kind of READ, but now I have! John, if you somehow hear or read this message, I just wanna say thank you so much for Hazel, Augustus, Isaac and Phalanxifor and I forgive you for raising my expectations of a girlfriend/how to be a boyfriend. It was beautiful."
5,"ve read all of John Green's novels, I've watched almost all of his videos. He is an inspiration.The Fault in Our Stars is a book that should be read, digested and passed on to someone else.I read the book in a 24 hr period, and in a time of my life that I really needed a book like this.My Mother in Law is dying of Hodgkins Lymphoma. I pre-ordered this book before I knew what it was about, and before she was diagnosed. When I realized what the book was about I didn't know if I was going to be able to read the book because I didn't want to reminded of what cancer was doing to her. I read it anyways because I knew that John wouldn't let me down, and he didn't.I then passed it on to my 15 year old nephew because I knew that it would inspire her as it has inspired me to be strong for my mother in law, my husband, and my father in law.READ THIS BOOK. and then pass it along to someone else."
5," finished the book a few days ago, and I find myself thinking about it numerous times a day. This is not a book you read, say huh and then forget. After the mind-blowing event of reading it, you will find yourself dissecting, thinking, and analyzing things and conversations in the book throughout daily life. This is a book that will pull at your heart strings, make you cry, make you laugh, but most of all, it will make you think.I love book that make me think.And I absolutely love TiFOS.There has always been a weird protected spot in my heart where Alaska lives as one of my all time favorite characters, and now Hazel and Gus are there too.Great job, John."
2," Admittedly, I was a big John Green fan well before this book came out. And I also preordered it the week that it became available for preorder.I can honestly say that this is his best book yet.I finished the book in a single day, being unable to put it down, reading half before I went to work and the other half as soon as I was out. The book made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me contemplative of how things affect us in life. I won't write a detailed review because I fully believe in knowing as little as possible before reading a book (or when it comes to it, seeing a movie and watching a show), but I will be passing this book around to people who won't buy it on their own and encouraging other bookworms to buy it for themselves.In a month or so I will reread it to recapture it and also to gain perspective on the rest of the book based on the whole book.(PS - not really relevant to the review, but my copy was signed by a red sharpie! :-D )"
5," The Fault in our Stars is heart-wrenching, romantic in the most worldly and genuine interpretation of the word, indelibly thought-provoking, exceedingly symbolic, and spectacularly funny.John Green has done it again. He has recreated with merely imagination, influence, and ink the completely characteristic and honest mind of a teenager, while acing a new challenge: the mind of a teenage girl. I reiterate, John Green has done it again, and this time he has done it even better.Simultaneously clever, tragic, and hysterical, with equal doses of realism, hope, and heartache, The Fault in our Stars is an striking and valuable truth. Hazel's narrative seems to put into words the indescribable bits of us that come along seemingly at this one time in a life, while doing complete justice to the kinds of emotions that none but the terminally diagnosed fully comprehend.Most importantly, John Green never undervalues the intelligence of his readers, and he presents a broken that somehow remains whole world to a young adult audience in yet another raw and real novel. To me, this is what sets John apart.As a 16 year-old girl, I'd like to give you a suggestion. If you're thinking about purchasing this novel, I recommend you do so as soon as is humanly possible."
5," would not consider this a book review, as you have at least a hundred others to convince you to read it, however, I would like you to consider something.You will see in reviews here and there people mention the language used by teenagers in this book. In fact, after spending a sleepless night reading this book cover to cover, I came away thinking Kids just don't talk that myself. But then I took a walk at four in the morning in the brisk cold to consider what I'd just read and this is what changed my original opinion.John Green has often stated that we, as humans, do not imagine others complexly. This book is John Green's hopeful novel of two teenagers that ARE able to imagine others (and their lives) in a more complex manner than what we believe young people are capable of. John, quite simply, believes that young people are more than just surly, angry, underage hormones that walk and talk. He knows that, given the chance, young people are quite capable. They are artistic, capable of critical thinking, compassionate, intelligent and so much more.This is the story of two such teenagers."
5," There are no words that can adequately describe my feelings about this book. Through every page John Green weaves his tale about 16 year old Hazel Grace Landcaster and 17 year old Augustus Waters with perfectly timed humor and profound thoughts. His work on The Fault in Our Stars is absolutely beautiful. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and even more importantly it will make you think - reflecting, on the real meaning of life. TFiOS is intellectual in it's construction and it's cast of characters will leave you amazed as it takes you on a roller coaster ride that only goes up, to quote the book.Keep some tissues handy and get ready to enjoy this amazing book by an equally amazing author. The concept may be simple, but the story and the emotions that drive the characters are very deep and complex. It's brilliant. It's beautiful. It's profound. It's heart-warming. You simply can not go wrong with this book."
5," John Green is my favorite author, by a long shot. When I heard about TFiOS, the plot didn't really interest me, but I was afraid I would say I loved it just because I loved John and I didn't want that because I respect him too much. As the release date got closer, I became exceedingly excited about this book. I had preordered from Amazon, but I wasn't going to receive it until 3 days after, which happened to be today. But on the 10th, I realized I would not be able to wait 3 days to read it, so I drove to WalMart and bought another copy. I read it instead of studying for finals, which probably wasn't the best idea, but I regret nothing. That being said, I will admit TFiOS did not live up to Looking For Alaska, but it's probably tied for second with Paper Towns. This book is about teenagers with cancer that met at a support group in the literal heart of Jesus. That's all I'm going to say about the plot so I won't spoil it for anyone, but I will say it made me laugh out loud and cry real tears. After I finished it, I went to bed with the book, hugging it. That may sound weird but.. whatever. Read this book. You won't regret it."
5," just finished reading The Fault in Our Stars. First of all, I will say that being that I just literally put the book down, I am going away from it with that feeling in your heart and the back of your throat. Its a very familiar feeling because its the one where you're trying to choke back all the tears but you just can not hold them back. From a complete non-spoiler perspective, as I would not want to ruin such a wonderful piece of literary work by spoiling it for others, I will say simply that if there is one book that you ever read, let it be this one.It captures the fears, desires, and wants that we have when faced with adversity. In this age, we see so many fantasy books out there that involves vampires, werewolves, witches, wizards, and mythical-magical beings. The Fault in Our Stars is based on fiction, as Mr. Green states, but it has all the components that could very well happen. I wish so many times, as he says in his acknowledgments, that THAT miracle should exist. I want it so bad because I've lost so very many people that I love dearly to Cancer.As I was reading the book, I recollected the times I spent with those people. He describes it so well because the things that these characters go through are nearly identical to what I have seen my own mother go through at her young age of just 38.TFiOS will definitely make you laugh, cry, lose yourself in the deepest thoughts, make you wonder what if questions, and then you'll have this strange (or in my case anyways) realization that we are in fact mortal. These shells that hold our souls, personality, hopes, dreams, loves, fears, anguish, and all those emotions make us human. My mother died of Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma when I was 14. I am now 30 years old but those memories of her are still incredibly instilled in my mind and I see her now through my memories I have of her.Anymore that I may say regarding this novel will unintentionally reveal spoilers and I will end this review now. I will only say, in closing and reiterating, that if there is one novel that you read, let it be this one. You won't be disappointed and I think that it has left me with a lot of answers to questions I've carried for a very long time."
5," 'The Fault in Our Stars' is heartfelt without being sentimental, wry without being cynical, funny without being crass, smart without being condescending, sweet without being sappy. It's both heartbreakingly hopeful and refreshingly honest.In short, it's John Green's finest novel yet. Which, if you've read his excellent body of work so far, is saying something.John Green writes astonishingly well in the voice of Hazel, a teenage girl with terminal cancer. The story of her survival, her friends, her parents, the books she loves, the hopes she hangs onto, and her growing attraction to the clever and charming Augustus Waters comes at us through Hazel's own words - often funny, sometimes angry, sometimes sad, always real.Let's be clear: 'The Fault in Our Stars' is not a cancer story. It's a story about a girl who happens to have cancer, and that distinction is what makes it so powerful and resonant and authentic. Hazel and Augustus come through with the clarity of truth, as do their parents and friends and those they meet along the way.I lost count of how many times I laughed out loud while reading 'The Fault in Our Stars,' and the times I paused to think about some of Hazel's observations. I know I cried on page 90, and tears came again at the end. I know I'm glad I read it. I know I learned something new about myself because of reading it.In the ocean of human experience, and in John Green's own words from one of his videos, 'The Fault in Our Stars' makes me grateful to be a little boat, full of water, still floating."
5," A novel like this only comes around once every so often. So eloquently written, Green's words spring to life and paint a story that is simultaneously heart breaking and yet full of such beauty, love and hope. On every page there are phrases to be remembered.Do yourself a favor and read this book. It's one of those Lifechangers."
5," You should read The Fault In Our Stars by John Green. It came out not even two weeks ago and I've already read it twice, and I can't stop thinking about it, and I want to read it again even though I finished it 12 hours ago.  Yes it is technically Young Adult fiction but who cares?  This book is so well written and thought provoking that I think it will speak to so many people.  It's a good book that's funny, sad and smart.  JUST READ IT... you won't be sorry."
5," am a huge John Green fan, this is the first book I read by him and I have now read all of the others. He is funny, smart, witty, and even if you aren't a teen, you will love this book. Read anything and everything by John Green, you will laugh, cry, and probably become a better person. Really though, this book is amazing."
2," Even if you don't have cancer or know a person with cancer it is a book worth reading.  Two young people meet fall in love, and it's a story that gives you hope...Reading it I could see Gus and Hazel together as a couple...amazing writing draws you into the story and you won't be able to put down till it's done"
5, am a cancer survivor. The way he portrays the people in his book is nothing short of miraculous considering he's never had cancer. I looked it up on Wikipedia. He got his insight into the world he portrayed so beautifully from the work he did in a Children's Hospital. This is one of the best books I've ever read.
5, This book made me laugh out loud and cry at the same time. It was beautifully written. I though the characters were so believable. I would highly recommend this book for high school age (some sexual content might not be appropriate for younger ages) or adults looking for a fairly quick but fabulous read!
5," think this book has a few good points, e.g. how cancer was dealt with, but in general, The Fault in Our Stars is just ok. The plot twists are glaringly obvious and the novel lacks creativity and intrigue. Further, the characters are awfully two-dimensional for the length of the book."
5," read this about a year ago, and I have read it around 5 times since.  It is an amazing book, and Holt McDougal has become one of my favorite authors!  I haven't purchased my copy yet, because I'm holding out for an autographed copy.  I patiently await the Holt McDougal squiggle!  One day I will have one, whether I purchase it or meet him face-to-face.  Fingers crossed for the latter.  ;)"
2," decided to read this book because all of the girls at school were reading it, and I wanted to give it a go, though I suspected that I wouldn't like it. Most of the people who enjoyed reading this book didn't read much and are total opposites of me. My best friend read it, and she hated it. She advised me not to read it, and I should have listened to her warning. Needless to say, I hated it. (Warning: Spoilers Ahead!!!) First of all, she (Hazel, the main character) tells the reader straight from the beginning that she is not pretty. A few pages later (Literally! Page 16, Chapter 1), a random stranger (Augustus/ Gus) tells her that she's beautiful. She then yells at him for smoking (Yes, yells at some dude she just met about smoking), and it turns out, he doesn't actually light the cigarette, it's a metaphor (Come on, Hazel. Why didn't you think of that?) He then proceeds to invite her over to watch a movie, and she goes to his house (Hello?! Stranger Danger, anyone?) She even says that he could be an ax murderer, but what the heck? Her life is boring, and she's depressed, so it's fine. Her mom actually let's her go to this stranger's house,with no question. The book continues with icky, gushy romance stuff, etc. Hazel is constantly reminding the reader of how hot Gus is, and what a deep thinker he is, and ooh he's so amazing! And then when he tries to kiss her, she panics. Either you like the guy, or you don't. Make up your mind! Hazel has this weird obsession with a book called An Imperial Affliction, about a girl with cancer. The book doesn't really finish, and Hazel just needs to find out what happens. So her and her boyfriend visit the author in the Netherlands, and it turns out he's a drunken lunatic. He tells them that they're going to die soon, and that people are only nice to them because they have cancer. How is a teenager with cancer going to feel when they read that. There is more cheesy and slightly inappropriate stuff, and before you know it, Gus is dead. Hazel then gets hysterical, and is not very nice to anyone, especially her parents. Then she finds a letter from Gus about how great she is, and the book ends. It starts depressing, and ends depressing. This book took me two days to read, and those are two days of my life that I'll never get back. I look forward to seeing the movie with my best friend for amusement. Lesson learned? Life is bad and never will be good. Also, there are some truly horrifying books in this world."
5, can't get past the terrible dialog. No teenager talks like the dialog in this book. None.I understand and appreciate the themes and messages in the book. But I literally burst out laughing at the dialog. I don't understand how people can't overlook how cheesy it is.
1," The Fault in our Stars is a young-adult fiction, romance novel written by John Green. The female protagonist in the book, Hazel Grace Lancaster who has had cancer in her lungs for 4 years is trying to live a normal life. Hazel has many thing in her life that prevent her from living normal, one being a support group she must go to every week in order to “help” her with her depression. The first support group meeting they have in the book Hazel runs into a kid name Augustus Waters. Later into her support group she ends up seeing Gus staring at her, the whole time. When Hazel walks into the parking lot Gus is there running after her waiting to say hello. The relationship of these two beings develops into something bigger, Hazel does not want it to on the other hand because she feels that she is a ticking time bomb that could explode and hurt anyone in her way. With a few bumps in the road these two lovebirds had almost made it.  The Fault in our Stars is an incredible book that can be inspiring to many people to show them that it will pay off to live life in the moment and to not live life in the past nor the future. Most of the time people think about the future or worrying about what happened the days before, but in the book The Fault in our Stars John Green shows through his characters Hazel and Augustus that it is only the present that counts. An example of this is when Hazel did not really think about the effects that could happen from her having cancer and going on an airplane but she instead chose to feel happy about doing something that her heart would follow. In this book John Green also shows how when one's unhappiness and not living life in the moment can affect them and people around them. One example of this is when Hazel was scared to let anyone into her life because she felt she was a ticking time bomb ready to explode. The author used this metaphor to show how when one day she passes she’s going to end up “destroying” the people who love her, which means she is thinking and living on what’s happening in the future.  The Fault in our Stars is overall a great book and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a funny, thrilling, and a tragic reality of being alive and in love novel. The Fault in our Stars is an amazingly crafted novel and could teach you the true meanings in life."
2," had no intention of staying up all night reading The Fault in Our Stars when I borrowed it up from my library’s digital book collection last Saturday, but somehow I did. I also had no intention of speed-reading through it, sobbing my eyes out and emptying a whole box of tissues in doing so, but I found myself staring at a pile of soggy tissues and wondering WTF I was thinking picking up such as sad book. (THIS IS WHY I HATE READING SAD BOOKS) Regardless of my hatred of a sad ending, I still found it in my heart to fall in love with The Fault in Our Stars.Maybe it’s because one of the biggest themes of the story (not letting chronic illness rule our lives) hit home on my own chronic illness journey. This book was so relate-able in a way that anybody affected by chronic illness could draw comparisons to in their own lives. I respond well to characters I can relate to and I know that other people do as well. The Fault in Our Stars is one of the rare books where I didn’t hate any of the characters. It was fascinating how Green depicted these characters, it was really interesting to see how John imagined people would respond to facing their own mortality.Hazel has spent her terminal diagnosis worried about how her death will affect her surviving family. She rarely cries or complains (unless someone says something stupid in trying to show sympathy – this happens to me often as well, so I mostly applauded her), only worries about her mom and dad putting their lives on hold to watch their only child die. Even though Hazel hates to admit it, I found her to be an incredibly inspiring and selfless main character. She is definitely one of the best young adult fictional role models out there, in my humble opinion. Reading about her struggle has taught me I need to stop and think who is listening before I complain about my aches and pains. The only problem I had with hazel is that she hated V for Vendetta!! How is that even possible??Augustus was no slouch in terms of main characters, either. He feels a lot of loyalty and love for his friends – even when others may consider said friends to be bigger pains in the butt than they are worth. Gus is also pretty swell at reading people, and it was fun to watch him maneuver Hazel into finally living.To sum up, Hazel and Gus were stellar main characters. They found a way to live life to the fullest for as long as they were given in a way that healthy people might never understand, but I do. People who scoff at learning life lessons in fiction, should read The Fault in Our Stars. Hell, everybody should read this book – even if you are like me and hate shedding tears or sad endings. Hazel and Gus are so worth the price of swollen eyes and a runny nose. You’ll need an inconvenient amount of tissues, but you’ll come out of the love story of Gus and Hazel glad you finally read it. I sure was!"
5," As someone whose life has been intimately touched by cancer, I was extremely hesitant to read The Fault in Our Stars by John Green. Regardless of the positive reviews, bestselling status, and movie adaptation, I simply was not ready to subject my emotions to a book about the awful disease. As time passed, however, I was overcome with curiosity. A year after cancer invaded my life, I finally broke down and read the book that everyone was talking about.Sixteen year old Hazel has a terminal case of cancer. An experimental drug has held the tumors at bay, but the threat of the disease remains. Her lungs regularly fill with fluid and she requires the assistance of an oxygen tank to help her breathe. There is no denying the truth. Cancer will kill Hazel. But there is much more to to this character than her illness. A voracious reader, college student (she completed her GED while undergoing treatments), and fan of America's Next Top Model, Hazel shares many attributes of a typical teenage girl. At the insistence of her overbearing mother, who fears her daughter is becoming a recluse, Hazel finds herself at a weekly support group for  critically ill teens. She grudgingly attends the meetings, but the shallow sentiments of the group leader and rotating group of teens (it's hard to keep a consistent membership when all of the members are terminally ill) do little to interest Hazel.It is at these meetings where Hazel first meets Augustus Waters. A lanky, attractive, former high school basketball star, Gus lost one of his legs to cancer. The young man seems to live life by his own rules. For example, Gus frequently places an unlit cigarette in his mouth, a metaphor for controlling  something that has the power to kill him. The two immediately hit it off, bonding over literature and philosophizing about life and death. As their romance blossoms, they face the ugly truths about cancer and the ways the disease will inevitably affect their relationship.John Green does an incredible job of accurately portraying the horrors of cancer and the way it shapes the lives of those who come in contact with it. As a young adult novel, this book could easily have fallen into the trap of romanticizing a love story about teens facing the hardships of a disease. Fortunately, Green's characters are written with the kind of depth that allows readers to naturally become enraptured in their story. It is great to see an author write intelligent characters who are smart because of their thoughts and actions. . . not because he told us they were! There are no against all odds or wisdom beyond age sentiments in this story. Rather, the character grapple with the fear and unknown that comes with a terminal diagnosis. We see the horrific toll that cancer can take on the human body, mind, and soul. Yes, cancer largely influences the story, but it is the incredible, once in a lifetime kind of love between Hazel and Gus, that makes The Fault in Our Stars the rare, must read book that it is."
2," read this book a while ago and thought it was brilliant, to the point of almost perfection.Reading it again, I have now come to the realization that it is...well...not.I'd like to mention that this first point wouldn't have been made by me had it not been for another helpful reader who proclaimed that the ending is totally predictable. The first time, I honestly had no idea. The second time (though this answer may be a bit biased having already known what the ending was before picking up the book), I realized that the ending was predictable beyond words. Like a suicide victim, the signs are all there for anyone to see them. I mean (I'm only doing this because I feel as if everyone in the world is already aware of the ending) Augustus talks about dying throughout the entire book even though he seems perfectly healthy. Then, would do you know? Hazel gets über sick. It's totally obvious. I feel as if John Green had his devious plot twist already anointed, and maybe he was TRYING to make the reader see the truth. I don't know. Point is, the end is way more predictable than it should be. I like being surprised. But then again, that's just me. Maybe you hate surprises. I'll never know.My second point is the dialogue. Dialogue is fun! Dialogue is easy! Dialogue seems to flow right from the pen! The hard part is making it sound realistic, which Green did not manage to accomplish. If Hazel and Augustus were any two actual teenagers (especially living in Indianapolis, I'm sorry), they would not be speaking through words like haram and entendre and soliloquy. Even the most intellectual of teenagers do not speak like this. Even the most intellectual of ADULTS do not speak like this. Though their conversations are fun and easy-going, it's not realistic which sort of turned me off (in the book sense of the phrase, of course).I noticed while reading the Hunger Games again (I was on a read-everything-over-again marathon), John Green said that THG was brilliantly paced. And it was. (At least the first book was, but that's a whole another realm). This book, however, was not. I found myself saying, multiple times, Wait...that already happened? The first time I read this, I admit, I thought the pace was gold. This time, I found myself disgusted that two virtual strangers would go on a trip together, while in love!, after meeting each other merely like what? Two days ago? That's what it seemed like to me. It was too rushed. The whole book seemed to just be leaping to get to the ending.My last argument against this book is the tense. I am 97% sure that this is something normal people do notice (and 100% sure that there are 4,000 things I did not notice that normal people did), but I am not a normal person. After having started the feat of a novel myself, I realized that words flew easily, dialect flew easily, plot was a snowball rolling downhill at exorbitant speeds; but tense was the hardest thing of all. By far. So I don't blame Green for his mistakes. After all it is such a tiny thing. How strange that the tiniest little things stump even the greatest of authors? Most authors write books in past tense, because it's easier. But Green challenged his writing capabilities and attempted present tense, which is really cool in my opinion. That being said, he did butcher it in a couple of places. But then again, we all do sometimes.That being said, I want to say that I did really enjoy the book. It was an easy read, and took me only about 3-4 hours to finish. But that's what I wanted. It's not mind-blowing or all-encompassing. It doesn't reach out to all people and touch their hearts in a soothing embrace. It doesn't satisfy the needs of every crazed romantic. But it is enjoyable, and it made me laugh. It was very funny, something that I really like about Green books--no matter what they are, they're always funny. Obviously a good thing. It also made me cry, which is huge. I often judge books like these on their ability to make me cry (call me a masochist, whatever), something that this book did. Why would I judge a book in such a horrible way? Because if the book makes me cry, it means I actually care about the characters (or it means I dropped the book on my face while reading on my bed and it was a hardcover and it really hurt, but that's not the case with this book). And if I care about the characters, it means the author (sacred things that they are) wrote them well enough and deep enough to the extent of apathy being lost. One of the major downfalls of all great books is character development (or lack thereof). Green, however, managed to create a deep, though slightly boyish (it's understandable), character with real-life feelings and real-life emotions (though no real-life dialect). And she made me cry. It was brilliant.I guess my point is that, though the book has many mistechnicalities, it's not past the point of salvation; it was still thoroughly enjoyable."
5," With so many reviews, it'll be hard to come up with anything that hasn't been touched on, but I liked it enough to add a say or two to what's here.The negatives seem to focus mostly on the book's plot and language being rather contrived. Um, I hate to state the obvious--but it is fiction, folks. Actually, I don't read much fiction myself, but I found the book a wonderful window into a world not many are privy to--that of the young who have lessons we can learn from as well. That in itself is probably too foreign to many readers; they can't stand the thought of young people with a message (I'm in my 60's, btw).It seems like the naysayers must be robots who like their fiction safe and always predictable. And, of course, one of the book's very themes touches on the wild and totally unpredictable ride the dying trip can involve. It does often alter perspectives, sometimes dramatically. It does make life seem almost metaphorical. In general, you can't lump all people of any age into one type, especially those on the terminal illness slope. Judging the book's characters on that basis is odd; the author had a tale which he handled well. Actually, I did think a bit of the plot was contrived--guess what? It's fiction! But obviously, it touched a lot of people.I came to this book not colored by anything the author had already written, nor have I seen the movie version, other than YouTube snippets (movies by their nature usually diminish one's book experience). And, as mentioned, I rarely read fiction anyway. But I found the book to be a quality presentation of what remains unseen and sanitized by most, so kudos to Mr. Green's take...I found the characters quite real based on what I myself have observed.It's a remarkable tale, and sure, the plot isn't universally applicable (fiction, remember!). Nor are the characters robot-like--they even speak metaphorically sometimes (horrors!). But if death doesn't bring out metaphors, what will?"
4," The Fault In Our Stars is hands down one of the BEST books I've read. I read it in less than a day, couldn't put it down.Hazel is fighting cancer, has been since she was a young Preteen. With her mother's pushing, she starts going to a support group for cancer patients. That's where she meet's Augusta, the one who will steal her heart and give her the love that they both never thought they would never have.Augusta is now cancer free and one leg down. He will have Hazel stepping out of her comfort zone and experiencing new stuff, instead of the way she was living. Only being around her parents and watching ANTM.A book is what brings them together. With this book, it will have them open up to each other and try to figure out why the author hasn't wrote a squeal and why he stopped writing it how he did. She has questions and they need to be answered.Using her one wish... to of course go to Disney Land, Augusta let's her borrow his. He's held onto it all this time and now they will finally be able to sit and talk to this author about the book that brought them together.I SERIOUSLY CAN'T GIVE THIS BOOK THE REVIEW IT NEEDS. IT DESERVES A REVIEW THAT I CAN'T WRITE, IT'S JUST THAT GOOD. I CAN'T PUT IT INTO WORDS.Fearing she will be a grenade to Augusta, that when she does finally die from her cancer she will destroy him along with her parents. This is why she isn't letting herself get close to him, but he wants her to be his grenade. They have the love that some can only wish for. They have true love.This book had me laughing, with her and Augusta's words. It had me balling like a baby.I applaud John Green for writing a book in a females perspective. WOW, he did such a wonderful job. Like I said, I couldn't put it down and read for a solid 5 1/2 hrs straight. I had to finish it.I can't wait to see this amazing book turned into a movie and see the characters I fell in love with on screen. FINGERS CROSS THEY DO THIS BOOK JUSTICE!READ ON!!!"
5," This book is a story of a quiet tragedy, love, and an undeniable reality. Parts of it are thought provoking, parts funny, and parts heart wrenching. As a parent of a child who has health issues and a brain tumor(thankfully benign) and as a former child who has faced death and a life of drs, it was particularly heart breaking. The parents in character. Their grief both before and after death, their fears and the mother's propensity to celebrate everything, their lives revolving around keeping their child alive, the quiet desperation was authentic.My complaints about the book are likely heard in many other book reviews of both this and any other book out there. Similar to Hazel's complaint. What happens to her?I've read other reviews who say that teenagers can't possibly speak this way. I've had friends who spoke that way as an inherent part of their personality. They were deeply reflective and confident in their beliefs. We had witty conversations. Not all teenagers dwell on looks, cars, football and who's hooking up with who. I say these reviewers have never known a sick child. It doesn't even have to be cancer. A child who has a chronic illness for example endures treatment, Dr visits, and knows more about disease and sacrifice than any healthy adult would dream. A child who is dying even more so. Facing mortality or morbidity strips away so many of the meaningless details of life. It forces one to face who you really truly are. It gives you fear, for yourself, for your loved ones. It causes pain that you are the sole reason those who love you look haunted and cry at night. Sick children are the same as adults when you strip it down. They carry the same burdens, hold the same hope, and are subject to their own inherent personalities."
5," John Green writes a horribly wonderful story about life, love, and cancer, with disappointment and reality on the side, in his novel, The Fault in Our Stars. Hazel's parents believe that she is depressed and they force her to go to group therapy sessions. She completely hates group therapy until Augustus Waters shows up, an osteosarcoma survivor. Thinking that Hazel looks just like Natalie Portman in V for Vendetta, he invites her to watch her doppelganger movie. And thus, the story of faulty fated love begins.Hazel is the girl I'd imagine a friend with terminal cancer to act like. She's blunt, witty, honest, intelligent, demanding, and full of spirit. What she shares with her readers is edgy and open, a diary spray-painted on downtown buildings. The connection readers feel with Hazel beings with sympathy. As she describes her illness and the waves of honesty swell and crash upon the reader, that sympathy turns to understanding and, in eventually, empathy. With Hazel's blunt force trauma of words, readers get it. They can grasp what they may have never experienced. Throughout the novel, which is just over 300 pages, readers see all sides of living with illness. There are situational examples of fear, hope, love, joy, depression, jealousy, despair, surprise, and preparation.The Fault in Our Stars focuses on Hazel and Augustus, depicting how they help each other to live a forever in a limited infinite. When Hazel shares her favorite book with Augustus, he has the same reaction she does: how can an author write a book without an ending? Luckily, Augustus has saved his wish so the two teens can fly to Amsterdam, where the author lives, and ask him what exactly happened to the characters after the last sentence was cut off and the story ended.The Fault in Our Stars was a miracle of misery, it had me laughing out loud and quietly crying in a subsequent nature. The only, dare I say, problem I had with the novel was the dialogue. I felt like the terminology and use of the English language was too old for Hazel and Augustus. Certainly not very often, but a few times, I had trouble imagining that a girl of sixteen, or a boy of seventeen, would have such advanced conversations. But, now that I've said that, I loved the way they spoke. I wish everyone spoke with such honesty and a highly developed vocabulary. It helped the quotes from T.S. Eliot et al fit right in."
4," This book is not just about cancer. Nor is it just about love. But when both concepts are combined, Gus and Hazel become alive in out hearts and minds and leave us wondering about the true meaning of love and life,and how to live it right. I can't quite thoroughly explain how much this book has, and still is, left me thinking about how metaphors are everywhere in life- surrounding us, haunting us with ideas of a universe that our minds cannot fully comprehend. Because intelligence such as these two people  have shared can only take us so far, and in my mind, The Fault in Our Stars, even in the title, suggests that we will never know, but we can live as though everyday is our last, and that sometimes, we don't need a whole understanding of the world for our hearts and souls to be whole. John Green has written such a philosophical book for such young people, and I believe that it's popularity has been reached by the inquisitive and restless minds of this generation, young people who are beginning to understand the themes in the book, not only the plot, which is quite extraordinary as well. I read the book months before the movie came out, and I loved it so much. Life doesn't have to be perfect for love to be extraordinary is such an incredibly thought provoking theme, as well. As for the events in the story, well Hazel and Gus are two teens with cancer....but this is not just a cancer story;  cancer is only the hamartia, or fatal flaw of these characters, as everyone has one. Hazel, the narrator, expresses that she fears that she is a grenade, as she is so sick that if she passes, she will hurt the people that love her most. Hazel has lung cancer, but has not allowed it to completely take her over, as she has a favorite book- An Imperial Affliction-  a rather cynical, pessimistic realism of cancer and dying, which she finds rather agreeable and falls in love with the book. When she meets Augustus Waters, a clever, equal to her own cynical but intelligent personality, the two travel to Amsterdam to consult the author of the book on it's disappointing and abrupt ending... and this is where I feel a metaphor was put in by the author (no spoilers though)  They fall in love and we discover that even people who seem perfect do of course have a fatal flaw....as the ending will most likely leave you in tears. The book itself and the ideas presented in in most likely leave you realizing that there is no true meaning of life, but that life has meaning, if you can understand that.Maybe I'm rather over thinking it, but John Green, no matter how eccentric and hilarious, wrote it perhaps with this in mind- that when presented with a beautifully written book, readers will most likely let their minds travel to the unknown and un- comprehendable.It seems to amaze me,  since my own mind cannot fully be fathom into constellations of thought, that Green could write such a meaningful book with such intricate little universal bits of genius, and still stitch a plot of wonder, humor, and incredible characters. I would recommend this to anyone of ten and older, as it is sure to be a contemporary classic"
4," am VERY ANGRY.  Why it took me so long to read this book? Before the movie I didn't know who John Greene was and I LOVE Reading, so what happened here? Why this book didn't cross my path. Why my BookWhore Friends didn't tell me about it? Why? Why? Because I needed to read it today. No two years ago. Today.What can i say that haven't been said? There's a quote i love a lot : No Two Persons Ever Read the Same Book.  That's so true.  So this review will come from the bottom of my heart.I learned everything about cancer and chemotherapy when I was 13 years old. I don't say I am a Cancer Survivor. I always say cancer didn't survive ME. Hazel and Gus are so much like me. Gus was so much like me. This book made me relive all those years of Pain, Loss and Survival. That being said. I will review now this masterpiece.This books is Beautiful. Inspirational. Real. Touching and Heartbreaking.  The way John Green wrote it, I can't say he did a good job. Good is a weak word. John Green did a Powerful, Believable, Awe-inspiring story about Cancer. About Cancer patients. Teenage Cancer patients.This book has a strong message. Life doesn't end because you have cancer. Everybody is going to die eventually. We are not immortals. We have to live everyday like it's the last. Love with all our heart and soul. Live without fears. Love without regrets.I laughed. I cried. I fell in love all over again with the idea of love.  I know what you are going to say: Life is cruel and unfair. We all know that. We don't always get our HEA. We all know that. The important thing is Living. Experiencing. Loving. Making memories.Love can't be measured by how long you have been with someone or by moments spent together. Love can't be measured. Period. Love just happens and It's INTENSE. So if you have the chance to fall in love for a week, a month, a year . . . If you get the chance to fall in love, let it happen. It might be not easy. It might hurt. Just keep in mind. It will be worth it!I Don't Recommend this Book. I will tell you, YOU HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK.Five OKAY ✭✭✭✭✭ stars are not enough.Thank you to John Greene. This is the kind of book that will be close to my heart until the day I die ( Not forever because I'm not a god, I know ) and Thank you for Hazel and Gus.But, Gus, my love, I cannot tell you how thankful I am for our little infinity. I wouldn’t trade it for the world. You gave me a forever within the numbered days, and I’m grateful.”"
5," When I first came across this book several months ago I wasn’t sure I really wanted to commit to reading what I just knew would probably be a depressing, tear jerker of a book. Don’t get me wrong I love good emotional books, but it’s like pulling teeth for me to go into a book knowing its probably going to leave me depressed.  But, like many of you, my TV began to be flooded with the trailer for the movie version, it’s like The Fault in Our Stars was screaming at me from every which direction to just get over my reservations and jump on in!I am so glad I jumped because this book was nothing like I feared.  Yes, I cried but instead of being depressed it was almost as if it left me feeling uplifted.  I know crazy right?  How could that possibly come after reading a book about teens with cancer?  Honestly, it’s hard to explain but if you don’t read any further in this review, please just know I think this book is one everyone should read.  Don’t miss out because you will not be able to walk away unchanged.  The Fault in Our Stars is powerful, emotional, wonderful and its a definite must-read!The Fault in Our Stars is told in the voice of main character Hazel.  A young teen who has been fighting cancer on and off for the last several years and who now needs the assistance of a breathing machine.  The cancer keeps trying to claim her life but her body isn’t ready to give up.  She has good days and bad ones and outside of her parents and the support group she is forced to attend she spends her life watching reality TV, taking classes at the local community college, and reading.  She’s read her favorite book, an Imperial Affliction, more times than she can remember, it’s as though the author is speaking directly to her.  Like he knows all about her and her fight with cancer.  The book’s ending is abrupt, just like her life potentially could be, and she desperately seeks the answers as to the outcomes of what happens after.One day at cancer support group she meets new comer Augustus.  She finds herself intrigued and these two start off down the road of friendship, eventually falling in love.  Augustus has never met anyone quite like Hazel and he cannot help but fall for her, however, hopeless it may seem to fall for a girl whose dying.  These two and their passion for an Imperial Affliction leads them on a quest to meet the author and finally have their answers.I loved both Hazel and Augustus.  Their outlooks on cancer and their life, came across as genuine.  They’re just teenagers who drew the short end of the stick of life.  Forced to grow up and miss out on some many rites of passage.  Their stuck between death and life, trying to make the best out of a crap situation.Their friendship, camaraderie and love for one another completely changes each of them.  I truly enjoyed seeing them find their humor in such crap circumstances.  Honestly there were multiple points in this story that I found myself crying ugly tears while laughing hysterically.  Obviously this was written by an incredibly talented, genius of an author.  Please take my advice and read The Fault in Our Stars for yourself, I don’t believe there is any way you can walk away from the experience disappointed.  I just hope the movie turns out as great as the book!"
5," had every intention of being one of the people who didn't absolutely adore this book. Not because I'm being mean or cliche or any other insult, but because after knowing what it was about I didn't expect the book to pull me in like it ended up doing. To be honest when I first started reading, I didn't think I was going to love it. You see, I was expecting a great book, but I was not expecting a book that would be just world shattering. Let me tell you, The Fault In Our Stars is much more than I expected, it is an emotion draining, yet comical masterpiece.After reading this book, you sit here wishing Augustus Waters were real because he would be an embodiment of all that is good in the world. I just adored Augustus in every way. His titled gait attached to a sexy fella, his love for action books and movies, his brain that can easily morph the worst situations in humor (I lit up like a Christmas Tree), and his words that (regardless of what he thought) are so beautifully written.There is a delicacy that I am writing with when I write about these characters, but in truth they are nothing close to delicate. They are strong and filled with so many layers. Hazel Grace, who is only sixteen and yet deals everyday with cancer, with being an early college student, with falling in love so hard yet still worrying if everything will be destroyed. However, regardless of everything she deals with, she gives all of her strength to others who need it and doesn't let something that she can't control stop her.The characters in this book are inspirations. Cancer or not, they would still be inspirations just because of their attitudes and wills to not only live, but love. I truly don't think this book is meant to be a sad one, but it will pull at all of your emotions and lord help me, I'm so damn glad it did.Other than Will Grayson, Will Grayson, this is my first true John Green book and I am utterly amazed. His writing is just...so good. I know good is such a mediocre adjective, but I mean so good that there is just no point in finding a better adjective. I love the humor, the impressive vocabulary, and the way that he makes you feel his writing. This book just blew my mind and I absolutely adored it.Ps. Brooke Lynn, I am SO sorry it took me so long to read this. I am obviously an idiot for not picking it up the moment you send it to me two years ago. *kicks myself* YOU ARE THE BEST!"
2," was not sure how I would feel about this book at first, just because of the premise of the story. I am so glad I decided to read it. This book is about so much more than cancer. It is about living your life, and not letting yourself become a side-effect to your illness. Hazel is a strong girl who is afraid that she is just a grenade to her parents and the people around her. Her mom tired of her sitting around the house being depressed makes her go to a support group with other kids that are either fighting cancer or in remission. I really liked the characters and felt that John did a great job with how they interacted with one another. She seems to have found a friend in the group named Isaac, a boy who has lost his eye due to his cancer. Upon Isaac's insistence he convinces his friend Augustus also known as GUS to come with him one night. And when Hazel notices him eyeing her the whole night she is not sure what to do. After all she is just a grenade you know. I so want to tell you more about the story and I could talk about a-lot of it but I want you to feel it for yourself. Just know that the relationship that those two have is special. We all hope to live forever but how do you deal with it when there becomes a time-stamp on your life? And although it is a fictional story you could feel real emotion. From the kids and the parents. Speaking of Hazel's parents LOVE THEM... They just want their daughter to have the best Life that she can no matter the length in a live everyday like it is your last kind of way. The story moved at a great pace and I could NOT put it down, in fact it left me with a book hangover.. If you love adventures and a bit of mystery, as there is a story with in the story, you MUST read this one but you might want to have the tissues handy just in case."
5," They met in a cancer support group:  Hazel Lancaster, a sixteen-year-old victim of thyroid cancer that has migrated to her lungs; and Augustus Waters, seventeen, in remission after bone cancer cost him one leg.Their eyes connected across the room, and an instant spark ignites between them.As love stories go, this one might seem unlikely, and as romantic characters, some might question these two.  But from the very first page, it was impossible not to sense something special between them.Narrated in Hazel's first-person voice, we are privy to their intelligent and witty dialogue, with its hint of sarcasm.  We learn more about them from these moments than any other back story could offer.  The story is set in their home town of Indianapolis, Indiana.Hazel's favorite novel, which she has reread several times, is called An Imperial Affliction, by Peter Von Houten, and is narrated by a dying woman.  Because the story ends mid-sentence, Hazel is obsessed with finding out the ending for the other characters.  After Augustus also reads the book, the two of them develop a plan.  To visit the author in Amsterdam, compliments of the Wish foundation.What happens to the two of them in Amsterdam?  Are they able to find the answers they seek?  What do they do when Van Houten shows them a disappointing flaw in his character?  And what unexpected truths does Van Houten later share?In the final moments of <a class=a-link-normal href=/The-Fault-in-Our-Stars/dp/B005ZOBNOI>The Fault in Our Stars</a>, we are gripped with the reality of what will surely transpire for these individuals...and for us, since we are now invested in their destiny.  From Van Houten's book, Hazel and Augustus have gleaned this philosophy of sick kids as side effects, a way of accepting their situation:Cancer kids are essentially side effects of the relentless mutation that made the diversity of life on earth possible.These characters are like real people, and as such, have their good days and bad days.  Sometimes their frustrations come out like an explosion, while at other times, the characters glean the necessary support from their group and their families to live each day to the fullest.  I liked the characters because they are not like the superficial teenagers that are often spotlighted in YA books.  For this reason, I enjoyed them and wanted to root for them.  The fact that they are unusual does not make them less believable, as some have noted, but makes them likeable.It is impossible not to feel connected to these two characters and to empathize with how their lives have taken them on a journey they would not have chosen for themselves.  But without this journey, they might not have met.  Was this destiny the fault of their stars?  An unforgettable story that will live on past the final page.  5.0 stars."
5," can't stop thinking about this book.  It has invaded my dreams.  I try to keep up with what my two granddaughters are reading and I always go and read what they tell me they've been reading for school.  For school?  My just-turned-thirteen year old younger granddaughter is reading about adolescents dying of cancer?  And she's assigned this book?  Won't it scare her?  Give her nightmares?  Make her cry?  And if it does those things, is that supposed to be a good educational experience?I don't know the answers to those questions.I read it.  It's like nothing I ever ever read when I was her age.  Sure, I read Dostoyevsky when I was her age.  And there were some pretty scary things happening in those books.  But -- it wasn't in the 20th century and it wasn't in this country, and it hadn't even been written in English.  so I was safe.  It wasn't going to, couldn't happen to me.  And besides, it wasn't assigned reading.  I read those books inside the books I was supposed to be reading.  You know, the textbooks were big and the library books were small and I could read them without anyone knowing I was reading them.  And I think that the fact that the books hadn't been assigned made me feel safer reading them than I would have felt if they had been assigned.For many years I have had a peculiar kind of respect for the people who wanted to censor books even though I thought they were completely wrong to do so.  But at least they seemed to have respect for the power of books to have an impact on how readers could have their experience of life, of the world, changed by what they read.  It seemed to me that many of the people who decried the calls for censorship didn't have as much belief in the power of literature to have life-changing influence on readers.So -- should 13 year olds be encouraged to read book like this one (and the other book by John Green that she told me was also important to her -- the book with Alaska in the title)?  It has certainly led to some interesting conversations between us.  And she seems to be handling what she's read quite well.  But how can anyone handle something so grievous as the relentlessness of a disease that kills children?  I don't know.But we do agree that the book is beautifully written.  And the characters are absolutely real to us.Why is this book relegated to the category of young adult?How soon will I stop thinking and dreaming about the book?  Because I confess that the things I worried about disturbing her have disturbed me."
5,"m going to come out and say I hadn't heard a word of this book until I'd gone to the movie theater where it was advertised legitimately everywhere. I spend more time reading than anything else so I decided, Hey, The Hunger Games was pretty good; why not? Blindly, I spent the five bucks and started reading. No matter how good or bad a book is, I'm one of those avid readers that just wants to know how it all ends so I read and read and read until my eyes burn. I finished the book in less than a day.Good News, first. It's quite obvious a lot of effort went in to creating the book and I'm guessing Green has a fascination with the very existence of existing since this is a concept frequently expanded on.(SPOILERS AHEAD: BEWARE) Hazel, the main protagonist, is a strange character with an interesting view point on the circumstance she is in. Like some have said, the story is basically hopeless: beginning, continuing, and ending with nothing gained nor lost. I think that's what Green was trying to portray since cancer is often a hopeless disease. My mom had thyroid cancer while pregnant with me and I can't say that she had much hope, although she is still alive today.Back to Hazel, she virtually begins as a cancer patient who doesn't believe in love before becoming a person with cancer who fell in love, but still finds it to be a strange concept while rejecting the idea of heaven altogether. She's not wishy-washy or a Mary Sue, rather a whole new type of character that I hear as just a monotone voice in the back of my head spewing philosophical-insight with no real belief in what she's saying. She's also awkward. She doesn't know what she wants and seems to be completely sheltered from everything, unless it's cancer related of course. While I understand this, it also seems unrealistic.Her parents are otherwise static characters, not changing very much until the mid-end when (SPOILER) Augustus is about to die. He's literally on his freaking deathbed, days away from meeting the Grim Reaper, and her parents start complaining about not seeing her around anymore. It's a bit of a put-off. I can understand why they fear how many days they have left with her, but she has far more time than the half-alive (or half-dead) Gussy, Gussy, Gussy. Let the kid mourn her first true love!Augustus is the perpetually charismatic, easy-going, intelligent while also sort-of funny boyfriend. The exchanges between him and Issac were perhaps my favorite since they showed the relationship of two friends that rather forget and deal later, one of the most realistic situations in the whole book. He remains this happy-go-lucky guy (SPOILER) up until Amsterdam when he-after leaving the center of the Virgin Diagram-tells Hazel his cancer has spread to his entire body, marking him up as terminal. Their remaining time is spent in a repetitive cycle in which they talk about death, discuss the universe's need to be noticed, kiss, nap, repeat. It's sad with an undertone of hopelessness, the key word of this novel that is never even used.Issac was hands down my favorite character. While his appearances were few, he held the most... unapologetic tone of them all. He was blunt while being rude in a way that offended no one. The loss of his girlfriend was rash, but the reasoning was quite understandable.Bad News: I don't feel like this story is all it's been cracked up to be. I purchased it thinking I was going to get a thought-provoking novel that'd only encourage this desire to see the movie, but I'm less than disappointed. I'm still going to see the movie simply because well, I'd like to see how the director adapts it and perhaps, even improves on what lacked in the book.What I received was most likely the sequel to The Imperial Affliction with a side of overly advanced vocabulary where it wasn't needed. Teenagers don't speak the way these teenagers speak; I would know considering I am one and, without meaning to be vain, the more eloquent of speakers myself. Hazel and Augustus's love story was meant to be something that it wasn't. It's tragic, yes, and hopeless from the beginning, but it wasn't much more. They never found anything in one another other than someone else who had cancer and, in a nutshell, didn't really believe anything would get better-with or without the disease.So, all in all, it's a decent three starred book (more like 2.5) and I'm hoping the story will become something worth the money on the big screen. I'm not sorry I read the book because it was different from anything I've read before, in the best and worst way possible. If you read this and are in debate on whether or not to read the novel, ask yourself this:Do I want to read a perpetually hopeless story of a girl and boy who both have a high risk of dying from page one that are made out to be star-crossed lovers, but really are just two kids with a limited lifespan and too much time on their hands? If yes, don't read it. You're kidding yourself. If no, give it a shot; what have you got to lose? (besides $4.99)REASON BEHIND THE STARS:The book took a lot of time to write = 1 starThe book is well written, no grammar errors, etc. = 1 starThe idea is not one I've come across before, therefore it deserves a certain amount of attention because I was surprised to have read something different. It's creative aspects are not to be downplayed, but it's emotional connection is lacking = 1 star.Overall: three stars - Certified: C+ (Graded on a curve.)"
5," Original review posted here:  [...]Inexplicably popular books take up the vast majority of shelf space in bookstores across the country. When John Green's The Fault in Our Stars was released, I had heard about it briefly and saw the rave reviews come flooding in. The only reason I could think of for this sudden, acclaimed reception was that John Green is the author. Only, I hadn't yet discovered that in order to fully determine the quality of something one has no clue of, one must endeavor to investigate said thing to make a concrete proclamation. Consequently, as a good reviewer and reader always should, I took it upon myself to investigate this book before the movie comes out on June 6th. The Fault in Our Stars proves to be a lovely--albeit heartbreaking--story sometimes clogged by forced existentialism.The story begins in Indianapolis with sixteen-year-old Hazel Grace attending her cancer support group. She has had thyroid cancer all her life, and it has spread to her lungs despite the lack of tumors in her body at the moment we meet her. In the support group one day, she meets a seventeen-year-old osteosarcoma survivor, and consequential amputee, named Augustus Waters. The two hit it off, and we begin to see that they're both incredibly smart and genuinely fond of one another. The relationship blooms over the course of the story as Augustus manages to help one of Hazel's dreams come true: to meet her favorite author and find out how a cliffhanger novel that the man wrote turns out.The characters in Green's novel are very, very well drawn and developed on a real scale; I found it incredibly easy to think that this is a story that could have happened with currently-existing people. The emotional rollercoaster Green sends us on is a sort of thing that happens every day, and granted, I think anyone who picks this up and knows that both of the characters are at-risk for cancer recurrence. Nonetheless, the description of what happens (I refuse to tell you) is so accurate, that my heart squeezed in on itself the further in I read. For those of us who have had failing loved ones, Green's novel makes it a process that comes as a thing easier to accept than do a lot of novels along these medical-story veins.While the characterization and story was believable, poignant, and very well done, there are moments within the novel that clog it beyond being reasonable. For instance, what drags the story down is the frequent--and often indecipherable--existentialist parallels that Augustus makes. Hazel, in fact, makes observations about life and the way the world weaves itself together with meetings and partings in beautiful little snippets; for instance, she makes several references in different places about how the shadows and light mingle together when trees cast the shadows of their branches on her and Augustus. Augustus has an unfortunate tendency to ramble and make little to no sense when speaking of...well, whatever it is he starts trying to sound important about. Overall, the story itself progressed nicely: beginning, middle, end, filled with complications and obstacles and pain, as a good story should be. The thing that dragged it down was the forced philosophy.Alcohol and drugs didn't play a massive part in the story, but they were certainly present: Peter van Houten drinks frequently to avoid life, Hazel and Augustus have champagne a few times, and Augustus has cigarettes he holds in his mouth but doesn't smoke (as a symbolic representation of facing that which can kill you only if you let it). I don't think prescription meds count as drugs here, but they're in the novel too. The only violent action would be when Hazel flips Peter's scotch glass up in his face after he's very rude to her. Profanity is present throughout; nothing gratuitous, however. As for sensuality, two people are seen making out in public, and Hazel and Augustus do end up having sex, though we are not shown it.After having read and evaluated how The Fault in Our Stars reached popularity, I can see how Green's writing skill in storytelling and developing earns well-deserved praise. However, everything that could have been cut and replaced to avoid clunkiness and clogging, should have had that done so. Here we are, though, with a final product that is good, but not the best it could be. In terms of connecting humans as we are where we stand, I think Green does a lovely job there. Despite its flaws, The Fault in Our Stars is an excellent story, reminding us that indeed we are limited in our time here on Earth. Every second counts, but not every second needs to be filled with meaningless attempts at forcing philosophy into our lives. God will lead us if we let Him; and when He becomes all we need, He Himself shows us the beauty in His life, as well as the beauty in our deaths."
3," Being the mother of a 19-year-old, I have had plenty of opportunities to read YA fiction as I have read many of the same books my daughter has.  When I try to compare this to other novels geared toward this demographic, the books that come closest are the Harry Potter books.  Wildly different genres with one group being highly imaginative fantasy and the other nitty-gritty life, but they are on par with each other.  The reason I say this is that neither book talks down to their intended audience.  They assume young readers are intelligent, thoughtful readers, and can process story lines beyond those that are typical.  While The Hunger Games and Divergent are both best selling movies and books, this book is much better than either of those in my opinion.It was very interesting that when I looked at other reviews, a common complaint was the way the main characters spoke and their advanced maturity level.  In direct opposition to this reaction, my first reaction to the book was how WELL John Green captured the teenage mind and spirit.  To be frank, the vast majority of teenagers seem largely concerned with Justin Beiber, what they are going to wear, and what celebrities are in the news.  However, that is a stereotype that doesn't hold true for all teenagers. During the years of needing to drive my daughter and her friends around because they were too young to drive, I have heard words and phrases come out of their mouths that were very similar to much of the dialogue of the book.  One review specifically noted breakfast exclusivity as something no teenager would ever say and I can assure you there are teenagers that would think, and say, something exactly like this.  I think John Green has done one of the most outstanding jobs of representing the teenager as I have seen the species, up close and personal.An outstanding book that will appeal to both YA and adult reader, as young adult fiction should.  Excellent"
3," The Fault in Our Stars is one of the best books I have ever read. No, it is not a fantasy book full of sword fighting, dragons, wizards, and monsters. It is a drama/romance book about two teens named Augustus Waters and Hazel Grace Lancaster who meet and fall in love at a Support Group.  But these two teens aren't completely normal teens. No, they are not vampires or werewolves. They are cancer patients.  John Green writes this book in a most amazing way that contains no fault. Instead of tossing numerous characters at you, he gradually introduces you to them one by one. Hazel Grace Lancaster is our narrator of the story. She is always very honest and fascinating. We learn that she had lung cancer and as a result, has to carry around a portable oxygen tank, which Hazel calls Philip, that delivers oxygen to her crap lungs that suck at being lungs. Hazel is depressed at the beginning at the story, so her mother sends her to a cancer support group, where she meets Augustus Waters, a 17-year-old teen who has a prosthetic leg. Augustus instantly falls in love with Hazel, while Hazel just wishes they can be friends. Hazel describes herself as a grenade meaning she could blow up any moment and hurt Augustus. While Augustus is no-evidence-of-cancer, Hazel is still very sick. Knowing she could die at any time, Hazel wishes they just be friends.  Hazel introduces Augustus to her favorite book, An Imperial Affliction, a book about a girl who has cancer which ends right in the middle of a sentence. Hazel and Augustus are both extremely curious about what happens to the characters. Hazel has written the author, Peter Van Houten, fan mail about what happens to the charachters several times, but he never responded. Augustus manages to get ahold of Houten's email, which he gives to Hazel. Hazel then emails Houten the questions she has about the characters. Houten replies he can not tell her by email because Hazel could copy it and make a sequel. The only way Hazel can find out if she meets Peter in person. The problem is, Peter Van Houten lives in Amsterdam, and Hazel's parents don't have the money to travel and Hazel has already used her one and only Wish.  Green then writes out a serious plot twist. Augustus has not used his Wish yet and is also eager to know what happens to the characters from An Imperial Affliction. Augustus then volunteers to use his Wish to take Hazel and her mother to Amsterdam. The two travel to Amsterdam where they go out on a romantic date, go to the Anne Frank House, visit Peter Van Houten, and kiss for the first time and become a beautiful couple.  The rest of the book I will leave for you to read. This book is inspiring, beautifully written, fascinating, and keeps you on the edge of your seat.  And the ages? I would recomend for  mature 11-13-year-olds for a brief sex scene, which is not at all graphic, language, and underage drinking.  This book is beautifully written. You get so attached to the characters that you love them. I could read this book over and over again and never get tired of it. You will laugh, you will cry, you will smile, and you will frown. John Green writes one of the greatest romance books for teens in the 21st century. I would give this book a billion stars if I could. There truly is no fault in The Fault In Our Stars."
5," Between my inner critic so desperately wishing to unleash itself on the many flaws of this book and my inner sensitivity that wants to hug a pillow and cry. I must admit, there were many times during my reading of this book that I wanted to delete it from my kindle and begin something more worthy of my time. Despite my incessant urges and blatant agitation with the author, though, I somehow managed to complete it.First of all, let me repeat what everyone has already said: the characters are severely underdeveloped and lack any sort of individuality to distinguish them from one other. Hazel and Gus in particular seemed to speak...similarly (and my word choice there is being generous), their dialogue always excruciatingly pretentious and beyond the realm of teenage thought. Not to mention Green's obvious misunderstanding of teenage girls, especially their jargon. Mr. Green seems to believe it is acceptable to voice his own honor society brain--usually attempts at literary criticism-- add a well-placed like or and stuff or whatever, and like think it's appropriate or whatever to say a teenage girl like thought it up and stuff.That being said, it is excruciatingly difficult to bash a book written about cancer patients, especially since my best friend died of brain cancer. And parts of this story reminded me of her, minus all the silver lining and teenage babbling. So with her in mind I turned off my criticism and tried to overlook the stuff that royally pissed me off so that I could think of a nice comment to make about this book. Here's what I came up with: a reader could read this in one of two ways, 1) focus on the cancer aspect and become as annoyed as I was at how unrealistic it all was or 2) overlook everything to arrive at the conclusion that this is a somewhat distracted and abstract romance novel. To look at it from a romantic's point of view, it is very sweet, touching, and refreshing. To read it expecting a cancer story will direct you to a very displeasing and depressing read. That may not seem nice in its bitter honesty but it's all I've got.So my advice is to refrain from reading this book unless you can make the intended main focus a secondary one."
5," Love this book. The book contains so many aha moments for a person who lives with a chronic disease (in my case almost daily migraines, with no hope of a cure, or even effective treatment), so many moments of direct moments where you feel connected to the main characters and moments that just give you hope, that I can't say the book was no more than simple enjoyment. It was an experience. Yes, I want to gag reading that myself, it sounds so corny, but I'm not sure of a better way of explaining the book for me. It's also extremely hard to know where to start such a review.I guess I can say that the book first really touched me when Hazel, the main character in the book, suffering from terminal cancer, describes herself as a grenade. Meaning, as she herself says in the book, I wanted to not be a grenade, to not be a malevolent force in the lives of people I loved. Hazel feels that her life (one of unending physical pain for her, emotional pain for her loved ones, since the whole time knowing her they know they will experience untold pain when she dies) damages those who are closest to her. As someone with a chronic disease, I know this feeling all too well, and before reading those words could not have explained that feeling of the positives of your life being outweighed by the negative consequences for those around you. First, let me say that being chronic, in medical terms, means that you suffer from a disease whereby it's effects dominate, at a minimum, 15+ days every months.  I had always thought of this fact as simply a medical number, needed for diagnosis realities. But today I realized that it means more than a number. It means that you suffer, overwhelmingly, from the disease and it's side effects (for chronic migraine sufferers, that means unrelenting physical pain and overwhelming nausea) more days in the month than otherwise. Meaning you spend *more than half of your waking days* in pain and suffering rather than the lack thereof. Meaning, at it's core, you have more bad days than good days in your life. You spend more time in pain than you spend with even the possibility of a good day (a day day being defined more by lack of pain, than by the ability to actually have good, enjoyable life experiences). So, needless, to say, you spend a lot of time inside your own head. Because you are extremely limited in your ability to be out and about and physical and enjoying life. So, yes, you spend a lot of time, a ridiculous amount of time, considering the value (or lack thereof) of your life, especially to those around you. You weigh, on a daily basis, whether you are more of a blessing or a burden to those you love.In the book, Hazel is able to focus on the fact that, as a child, a teenager for whom her parents are still responsible, her value to her parents is untold (of course, this brings with it its own responsibility and weight). For me, as an adult, I am more privy to life's responsibilities outside of those that relate to human relationships. For example, medical bills. If you are living with a chronic disease, you are a constant drain on the financial resources of those around you (rather than contributing). Your doctor appointments cost a fortune. Your medications cost a fortune. You are constantly in need of the help of others, draining their time and energy. You receive a bill, say, for $329.00 for the latest doctor appointment, and ask yourself if receiving the medical ramifications of that appointment (more often than not simply a renewal of your pain medications, which keep you on *just* this side of the edge of suicide) is more important than the negative financial effect on your family (i.e. odds are likely they cannot afford this doctor appointment, forget the next one 2-3 months later, and the next and the unending future doctor appointments stretching out before you). So day after day, week after week and year after year, your weigh the value of your life... you ARE a grenade. The question is: is the pain inflicted on those around you while you are alive (i.e. physical, psychological, financial) heavier than the pain you would inflict on them when you die?What this book does for readers like me is to try and REFRAME the question constantly cycling in our heads.  Instead, the question needs to become:  does the good you contribute to the lives around you have value in and of itself, separate from the fact that, as a grenade, you will, inevitably, cause them pain both while you are alive, and after you are dead. Because for those with a chronic disease, there is never any doubt that your disease will kill you. In this book, it is cancer that will kill Hazel. For someone like me, with constant migraines, it is likely mental health related (i.e. suicide out of overwhelming depression that life is a constant cycle of pain, rather than a constant building up of memories, most of them good and enriching and enjoyable), or a stroke or heart attack (likely to happen much earlier in life due to the damage caused to your body from constant brain damage and stress).The next, therefore, big aha moment of truth in the book is when Hazel talks to her father about the meaning of life, and he says that it relates to the universe wanting to be recognized or acknowledged. Meaning that we go on day after day not so much because of God and the possibility of an afterlife and what have you, but simply because there is *something* inside of us that demands recognition in this world. Hazel, while attending a cancer survivor support group, mentions to the leader that she wants to die (due to the unrelenting physical pain). And the leader responds by saying, Yes, of course. So why don't you? And, yes, the automatic response is that you don't kill yourself because of the pain such a death/suicide would have on your loved ones. But, upon more, deeper, thought... you realize it is MORE than this desire to protect your loved ones from pain. (noted by Hazel in this scene in the book) Most of us can't describe that feeling of why don't you die? We simply know that *something* keeps us around, and yes, maybe it is the universe's demand that IT be recognized, appreciated and valued. In the book, Hazel's boyfriend, Augustus, says that those people who *notice* the universe are those who perhaps best understand this... meaning the artists (musicians, physical artists, and even scientists in their own way), the ones who celebrate life and the universe. It's not those who try and leave the biggest footprint on the world, whether by doing great acts or being heroes or doing amazing things. Therefore, even if you, yes, live a life dominated by disease, which leaves you incapable of doing big, heroic acts, and instead focus on the small world around you, you can live according the universe's demand that it be recognized.And yes, as to the question of being a grenade, and causing hurt and pain to those around you, in whatever form... as Augustus says so beautifully at the end of the book, You don't get to choose if you get hurt in this world, old man, but you do have some say in who hurts you. Meaning that those who love you and have relationships with you, yes, you WILL hurt them, but, out of love, they have made the choice to be hurt by you, because their relationship with you has enough value (in the aforementioned scale of good versus negative value) that they'll take the pain in exchange for the good.With all of this (way too personal information) said, the book is a beautiful story about a boy and a girl. Two characters who, if you are a thinker, will feel like your soul mates, or people who would get you. They are both brilliant and hilarious (laugh out loud funny!), and it's a huge joy, and a privilege, to share your time with them. And yes, the book will cause you heartache and tears, but your time with these characters is, by your own choice, worth the hurt for the joy untold (too many to count or measure, as the dictionary defines) in the experience. HIGH RECOMMEND."
5," Since it was released, my friends have been telling me to read this book. About how fantastic it is. How beautiful, wonderful, and amazing it is. Let me tell you, they weren't wrong. I read this book back in December, but haven't written a review up to this point because ALL THE FEELS! I was spoiled before I read the book, which resulted in a steady stream of tears the entire time I was reading it. I picked it up when I saw my local indie had a signed copy, and after a couple days/weeks, I started reading it. I swear, I flew through that thing in a few hours straight, it was SO good!For the 1% of you that haven't read TFIOS, the main character is Hazel Grace Lancaster. She is a cancer patient. Her disease has been nothing but a death sentence since the day she was diagnosed. Fun, right? :) BUT, Hazel is one-of-a-kind. She faces this disease head-on, with humor, love, and a smile. She always has something to say, and she thinks some fairly deep thoughts. I really liked Hazel as a protagonist, and loved reading her story.The male protagonist was Augustus Waters. That perfect boy that every girl dreams of? Yeah, that's him. Augustus is witty, thoughtful, and often, outright hilarious. He's also a cancer patient, but has been in remission for many months. Augustus has learned that, when faced with your own mortality, all you can do is live each day to its fullest. Augustus wants to leave his mark on the world, and that's something that I admire.I cried and cried and cried and cried while reading this book. As in, there was a non-stop river of tears running down my cheeks. The book lived up to every expectation I've been given and then some. Also, it's very quotable, as one of my friends has proved by quoting it at us 24/7. Some of the best quotes are definitely That's the thing about pain, it demands to be felt. and Some infinities are bigger than other infinities. Just think about it, there's an infinity between one and two, but there's a bigger infinity between one and three. It kinda makes my brain hurt. Also, whenever someone says Okay. Okay. I get very near tears. There is no doubt in my mind that I loved this book, and I give it a full five stars!"
2," am not a fan of reading a book just because it is going to become a movie. In fact, I was adamant that I was not going to read this book because I had already seen the trailer and being the person that I am I had already guessed what was going to happen in the end. But everyone is entitled to be wrong once in a while and though I did guess the right ending I did not guess how I would subsequently feel at the end of this book.First let me start of with why I  ended up reading this book I was so adamant about not reading. Well my roommate decided to spontaneously or not so spontaneously buy it. Unlike me when she sees a preview for a book that has gone mainstream and is being made into a movie she just has to read the book before seeing the movie. I on the other hand could care less. But ironically enough it was while waiting for  a video to buffer that I picked up her copy of The Fault in Our Stars and began to read. Once I started I stopped only once and it was because you can't consciously move out of your dorm and drive four hours while simultaneously reading a book. Or at least I can't.This book was about more than true love, it was about more than crying about the unfairness of life, it was about more than a young person's battle with the horribly ever-present cancer. This is about...well quite frankly I do not know what it is about. And I refuse to try to express what it is about or to philosophically relate it to real life. Most of the time I never read the author's note but this time I did and on thing Mr. Green said was that the story was fiction and in no way shape or form should we take it to be based on a true story or even remotely real. But yet when I finished the book I was convinced that it had to be based of someone's real life story because I was crying my eyes out over a book filled with figments of Mr.Green's imagination which was crazy and ultimately I wanted to cry over a real person.So I then read his acknowledgements where he mentions Ester Earl and well I started to relate her to the book and realized that I was doing exactly what he didn't want me to do. But I couldn't help it but Ester Earl is not Hazel Grace, Earl is real while Hazel and Augustus are no matter how much I might have sadly and happily wanted them to be. I should be relieved that this story is fiction which I am but at the same time I'm not.I doubt this review will ever help anyone but this book is a rare find. Most book are a fantasy of life but this book is life. Not because it is sad and has cancer and death. But because it made me come to the horrible realization that everything just is. I,too fear oblivion like Augustus, I don't have cancer but I am dying and isn't that the crux of it all. We are all dying and unfortunately we can't prevent who gets taken up in the worldwide of our prolonged death so aptly called life. This book encompasses all that and more so well if your up for it, read it."
5," Hazel, a terminally ill teenager, meets Augustus Waters at a Cancer Support Group. And nothing is the same again.I was about a quarter way through when I realized two things- 1) I might have also fallen in love with Augustus Waters. 2) I had a strong feeling that I should probably go to bed because I wanted to read uninterrupted and I had a sneaking suspicion about what was going to happen and wanted to be alone when it did. This could, sadly, be due to the fact that a well meaning, but utterly clueless adult spoiled the ending for me early last year. While I reassured him that I totally knew the ending already (I didn’t and had kept clear of any spoilers til that faithful day), and that he should be a little more careful when describing the book to people (he said he would be), I was deeply saddened that I knew the ending and that now the story might not resonate with me as much. Perhaps that is why it took me so long to read it. I have owned the book since January 2012.In any event, I shouldn’t have worried. Knowing the ending didn’t detract at all.I won’t say anything different than what others have said before me, so I will summarize.Hazel’s wonderful. She’s a free thinking, dark individual whose honest and raw narration is heartbreaking and inspiring.Augustus is marvelous. He is awkward teenage, lyrical prose romance on paper. He is optimistic and a force.The story is powerful, emotional and well written. This is by far my favorite Green book. His writing is perfection here, able to describe and summarize the essence of teenagers, love and mortality without being preachy. He doesn’t look down on his readers or characters; he instills a sense of realism, allowing the readers to transport themselves back in time when they were teenagers and feeling everything so acute, so rare, for the first time. And then he cuts your heart.Well done, Mr. Green.Thankfully I went to bed. I don’t know how I would have faced the world otherwise.Rating 10 One of The Best"
5," The shear amount of attention of 5 star reviews that this book got was what made me want to pick it up. I went into it knowing nothing of the book, the author or the plot, in any way. What I discovered was a new favorite author. The writing is just phenomenal. I found myself laughing while reading and pausing to think about what I had just read. John Green is a very talented author. The characters in this book are wonderful as well. Very likable and relatable in some ways. I do agree with other people who say that the characters in this book are a bit unrealistic, for their age. I understand why John Green chose to make them teenagers, but if the characters were a bit old, the dialogue that they have would make more sense (those, it is important to note, that if the characters were older, a lot of other aspects of the book would be greatly altered as well, likely making this book greatly less amazing).I loved Hazel Grace, the main character, and Augustus Waters, the other main character. They are a great duo and are kind of made for each other. Their dialogue, while unrealistic in my opinion (as explained above) was so clever and so funny and just adorable and perfect. The type of humor in this book is great as well. I really love how John Green pays close attention to the small details relating to the characters and how they think. Its just wonderful. I was not as moved by the story as others were, though the story is incredibly moving. I thought that the book ended beautifully, though for some undefinable reason I feel a little let down. I am not sure why though (maybe I just didn't want the book to end?).All in all, this book is a definite must read. The hype around it is for good reason. The writing is just out of this world and the story itself is very beautiful. I am happy that picked up this book to see what all the fuss was about. The only reason I am rating it 4 out 5 stars is because of the unrealistic elements in the book that turned me off just a tiny bit. Its still an amazing book that everyone should read though!"
5," The character development in this book was excellent. John Green does a great job of translating character to persons dealing with cancer--be it first hand or being the loved one of someone with cancer.  The emotional responses vary with all the different stimuli, age range, etc.Honestly, everyone pitched this book to me as super sad, but great book. Although it was sad (I mean it's about cancer kids, of course it's sad), I was more interested in how they were dealing with everything than considering the morose side of the book. I think the fact that I knew from the beginning that Hazel has cancer and is dealing with it made me more numb to the cancer side effects that occurred. I felt like the author did a great job keeping it realistic and interspersing common adolescent problems with the undertones of cancer.The book besides being about the love story between Hazel Grace and Augustus, was also mainly about the search for the end of Hazel's favorite book. A Cancer Book as Hazel calls it, the book ends without a proper wrap up (in the middle of a sentence) where the reader is to understand that the main character became too sick to write anymore. [spoiler]******************************************************About a third of the way through the book, I had a sneaking suspicion that John Green would do the same thing to his readers. Although it wasn't exactly the same as the fictitious book, I still hoped for a little more out of the ending. I actually was expecting Hazel to die at the end of the book, so the twist that it was actually Augustus that succumbs to cancer was a knife in the chest, but I think it was a really good literary decision. I just wish the author would have told us what ultimately happened to Hazel.  I would have liked a nice epilogue, maybe from Hazel's mother's point of view (as a counselor?), talking about when Hazel died and showing that her and her husband were able to survive effectively.[spoiler]"
4," My Thoughts: What can I even possibly say about this one that hasn’t already been said? Probably not much.We are introduced to Hazel who is a teenager who has cancer. She’s on a drug that keeps the tumors down but you never know when it could come back. She struggles everyday. She has to carry an oxygen tank with her everywhere she goes. Her life is not fun.Her mom suggests she attend a weekly support group. She doesn’t want too but wants to make her parents happy. She meets a boy named Augustus. He also has cancer as well. He lost a leg to it.Hazel and Augustus were so perfect for one another. They got each other. They had things in common, they fell in love.There was just something so unique about this one. This novel was so beautiful. It really was. It was so complex and there was just so much to it, I can’t even begin to describe it. Its one of those you have to read yourself and enjoy every minute even though its not all happy moments.I also loved all the side characters, especially Isaac. He was the perfect friend for both Augustus and Hazel.It did take me a few days to get through this one. It was hard to read at times. I wanted to finish it, but I was afraid of what was going to happen.I laughed, I cried, I cried even harder. It was outstanding. It was beautiful.Enough said, right? Read this one!Overall:I really enjoyed this one,even though it wasn’t perfect at times, and things weren’t always happy. It was realistic and beautiful. I can’t even, I can’t even.Cover: Like it. Its not too out there but it’s also neat.What I’d Give It: 5/5 Cupcakes__________Taken From Princess Bookie"
5," couldn't decide if I should give it 3 or 4 stars, so I really wish there was a 3.5 rating.This was an interesting read to me (and hard to review) because I was hooked and read the entire thing in one evening, but there were definitely parts that bothered me.  First, the things that bothered me:***SPOILER ALERT****1.  Ugh... the pretentiousness of the main characters.  Not just Gus (as the author states was on purpose), but also Hazel.  Green touts himself as understanding teens but, in my experience, teens don't talk like that, using fancy words and being all metaphysical/philosophical.  Maybe they want to think they do so they enjoy having Green write his characters that way?  From my almost 40-year-old perspective, I found it unbelievable and hard to relate to the teens because they didn't seem realistic.2.  I didn't think about this while reading, but after going through some of the other reviews, I have to concur.  The flippant way the characters deal with a terminal illness does not seem realistic and can be painful for those who are actually in that situation to read.  I know that Green said this is a cancer book that's not about cancer so I'm sure he didn't want it to be bogged down in the realistic thoughts of someone with cancer. I get that, but do feel for people who are truly in this situation.3.  I didn't like Hazel.  Besides being pretentious, I also found her to have an unrealistic sense of self-importance, which is probably weird because I feel like Green was trying to set the stage that she was completely unselfish and always putting others ahead of herself.  The things that I didn't like were her concern that her parents life would be over once she died, when she yelled at Gus during their fancy dinner because she felt something he said was directed at her when it clearly wasn't, and her concern over being a grenade.  It's like she assumed everyone loved her so much that they'd be completely broken when she died.  I suppose this was done on purpose to balance out Gus's view that he had to do something miraculous to be remembered, but it just made me not like her.  I think she could have been more middle of the road and the point would still have been clear.Things I liked:1.  Green is clearly a gifted writer and has an amazing way with imagery.2.  I love a good tragic love story and this fit the bill perfectly.  That's the reason I couldn't stop reading, despite not really liking the characters.3.  Green knows how to draw out the tears.Overall, I would recommend this to others.  I will try another book by Green to see if the pretentiousness was just in this book or if that's his way of writing.  If it's his way, then I'll probably pass on reading more."
5," This is a very moving story of terminal illness strength, self assessment, compassion, love, and loss.  Hazel Grace Lancaster, 16 years old, has been a stage-four cancer patient for three years having first thyroid cancer which has now spread to her lungs.  She is a sole child who meets once a week at a support group for young people between the ages of 12 to 18.  There are currently about 6 to 10 youngsters.  Hazel is bored and tired of attending the group but her mom feels it's a sign of depression and encourages her to attend to hopefully find friendship. So Hazel takes her oxygen cart in tow and attends the next meeting where she sits next to Isaac, who is 17 years old, has eye cancer, and is going to be blind.  Michael is 12 years old with leukemia; Lida is 16 yrs old in remission from appendiceal cancer, and a new handsome boy, Augustus Waters, 17 years old, previously having osteosarcoma, but he's at the meeting only as a friend in support of Isaac. Augustus is drawn to Hazel, inviting her to watch the movie, V For Vendetta as he compares Hazel to the actress, Natalie Portman.  Gus, as his father calls him, introduces Hazel to his folks, and they enjoy the evening watching the movie. Soon, Isaac is scheduled for his final eye surgery which will make him totally blind.  He's more upset with the loss of his girlfriend, who can't bear his loss, so Gus and Hazel are there to support him.  These kids are searching for answers; i.e., what is normal, they are not; what worth is life, they worry about how long; how can they appreciate each day until the end...this is something for all to strive for.  It's hard, Hazel needs more answers from the author of her most favorite book, An Imperial Affliction.  She sends him an email and his response is he will only answer her complex questions in Amsterdam, at his home.  Now, Hazel has to find a way to make this happen.  Regardless of the seriousness of having cancer, this is a warm and cozy story of love, caring, and support.  I believe this story was placed on my Kindle Fire to read for the special messages it holds for me.  Hats off to John Green, an awesome philosopher!  All families can benefit from reading this story."
4," This book took me a while to start reading and had taking me a while to write my review. I knew going into it that it wouldn't be an easy read. What could be easy about kids with cancer? But, everyone told me you MUST read this book so I finally did and I am so glad to have experienced the lives of Hazel and Augustus. Hazel compares her life to a grenade in this book; ready to explode and hurt those around her, I felt this book met the same metaphor... I was ready for it to break me.John Green was able to make me smile, make me cry, and make me fall in love with these characters. He made me think about life in a whole new way all in the eyes of teenagers struggling with their lives.  My thoughts are stars I cannot fathom into constellations.You go into this book knowing something is going to happen, you just may not know what that is. I keep myself from all spoilers because I wanted to go into this book blind and I am so glad that I did.Hazel is trying to live after cancer has destroyed her body. You struggle with her thoughts on living, dying, and what life would look like if she's not there.Augustus is also healing from cancer that took his leg and left him with a life so different from what he was before he was sick. These two meet at a cancer support group and together we are blessed with a story of love, encouragement, understanding and heroes.While this story will make you cry, there are also many points where it will make you smile and even laugh.  “It's just that most really good-looking people are stupid, so I exceed expectations.'  'Right, it's primarily his hotness,' I said.  'It can be sort of blinding,' he said.  'It actually did blind our friend Isaac,' I said.  'Terrible tragedy, that. But can I help my own deadly beauty?'  'You cannot.'  'It is my burden, this beautiful face.'  'Not to mention your body.'  'Seriously, don't even get me started on my hot bod. You don't want to see me naked, Dave. Seeing me naked actually took  Hazel Grace's breath away,' he said, nodding toward the oxygen tank.”Even though it took me so long to get the courage to read this book, I am so glad I did. I think it was written so well and will lead great into a movie. I hope that those making the movie stick close to the book and do it justice."
5," feel like I'm saying this all the time now, but I'll say it again - generally, this is not the type of novel I would pick up and read.  That's because I consciously avoid books that seemingly will turn out to be tearjerkers.  Now, I'm sure I have ignited a wellspring of emotions in many of you who are probably on the edge of your seats preparing to pounce on me for oversimplifying and totally misunderstanding Green's work.  Well, let me stop you there - that's not what this is.It's funny because I only read this book because I had stumbled upon and thoroughly enjoyed This Star Won't Go Out:  The Life and Words of Esther Grace Earl, which for all it was it really was not a book about cancer.  I fell in  love with her character, though, and so knowing that John Green dedicated this book to her, I decided to give it ago, despite myself.I'm so glad I gave The Fault In Our Stars a chance.  I loved it - the structure of it, the character development, including the development of life's and cancer's impact on familial relationships.  I loved that the novel was decidely not a cancer book.  It was a book about love and life, real and raw.  It was a book about infinities within numbers and, to paraphrase something Van Houten's character says in the book, how grief reveals who we really are. I thought Green was most skillful and contrasting the realities of the living and the dying - in Hazel's eulogy for Gus v. the eulogy she gave at his funeral, the way Gus was treated by his sisters v. how he was treated in the end by Hazel and Isaac, how Hazel's mom thought she'd react to her mom's preparation for a career in social work v. Hazel's actual reaction.And, boy did I love Amsterdam and Lidewij.Love and Awesomeness - thank you Esther Earl for inspiring this, and thank you John Green for writing it!"
5," Short and Sweet? I believe that this is one of those books that everyone should read. I know that a lot of adults are completely against reading things that fall into the young adult category, but I think that everyone should make an exception when it comes to this book. John Green does a beautiful job of writing a realistic story you fall in love with, even though the synopsis alone leads you to believe you're being set up for heartbreak. The raw emotional draws you in, making you sympathize for every single character as they struggle through their individual battles.Characters:Hazel Grace: From the very beginning, Hazel becomes a character who makes you laugh and cheer for her. Her realistic, and sometimes pessimistic attitude is what makes her so intriguing. It is obvious that she has been through a lot, and it has aged her far more than she should have had to. Still, she has not given up on life, even if she spends most of the beginning of the book wanting to stay in doors and read (there is nothing wrong with that, right?). We get to see many different emotions from Hazel as we read through the book, and it is incredible to see how her relationship with Augustus changes her so drastically. I suppose that love can do that to you.Augustus Waters: While Hazel is a wonderful character, it is Gus that I truly fell in love with. How could you not? Despite the loss of a leg due to his past cancer, he grabs life by the horns and wants to make the very best out of life. It is interesting to find how he was attracted to Hazel in the first place the first time they meet, and how their story continues to unfold from there. I believe Augustus portrays the average teenage boy versus the perfect one that authors often try to contort into their writings. He lies, he messes up, he has to apologize. That is what makes him so loveable. His willingness to do anything to make Hazel smile just makes him that much greater.The book is sad, that is a given, though I will not give any spoilers for those of you who have not read it (that can be the worst thing to happen when you so badly want to read a book, after all). I think that it is important to push past that fear of sadness in order to understand the true purpose of the novel. Here are two teenagers with their enemy being simply time and the hands that life have dealt them, and they do their very best to keep their chins up and make the best of their lives. This is an inspiring story for everyone, and might perhaps teach us that things could always be worse."
2," Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick &amp; Dirty: Beautiful heartfelt story that was an epic journey of love, loss, and humor. This has quickly become one of my all time favorite contemporary reads.Opening Sentence: Late in the winter of my seventeenth year, my mother decided I was depressed, presumably because I rarely left the house, spent quite a lot of time in bed, read the same book over and over, ate infrequently, and devoted quite a bit of my abundant free time thinking about death.The Review:Hazel Grace Lancaster was diagnosed with cancer when she was 13 years old. It was terminal from the beginning and she knew that she was a ticking time bomb. But when it looked like the end was near she was given a miracle drug that surprisingly shrank her tumors and stopped them from growing. She is 17 years old and living with cancer. She isn’t healed, but at the moment there is no threat of her dying. Her parents want her to live a somewhat normal life so they make her go to a cancer support group where she meets the gorgeous Augustus Waters.Augustus Waters was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, which is a form of bone cancer. He had to have his leg amputated, but he has been cancer free for the last 18 months. He went to the cancer support group to help a friend and when he sees Hazel for the first time he can’t seem to keep his eyes off her. Hazel and Augustus quickly become friends. They bond over books, cancer, and this is their epic love story!!!Hazel hasn’t been living life since she found out she was going to die. Yes, she is still alive but she just mostly goes through the motions. It’s not that she’s not grateful; it’s just that she doesn’t really see the point until she meets Augustus. I completely adored Hazel, she has a wonderful dry sense of humor and is very smart. I also love that she loves to read, we have that in common!!! Even though she doesn’t have the brightest future ahead of her, she never seems to be negative about it. Instead, she has excepted her life and is trying to be as positive as she can. She was a wonderful character and I enjoyed every minute of her amazing story.Augustus was so easy to fall in love with. He is determined to really live his life since he got a second chance and once he meets Hazel he knows that she is going to be a part of it. He has this adorable way of being persistent and making Hazel see that life is so much more than her cancer. He is funny, smart, good looking, and just an all around great guy. I really admired him and thought that he is a very swoon worthy boy!This was just a fantastic book that everyone should pick up. Going into this book, I was expecting a really heart wrenching story about a girl struggling with cancer, but what I got was a beautiful story about a girl that gets to experience life for the first time. Yes, Hazel has cancer and until she meets Augustus she has pretty much let it consume her life. But he is able to open her eyes and show her that life really is worth living. It was full of humor and plenty of adorable romantic moments. The cynical banter between Hazel and Gus was so fun and I found myself laughing way more than crying in this book. That’s not to say that I didn’t cry because I did, but Green did such a phenomenal job making you feel an abundance of different emotions throughout the book. I really enjoyed all the literary references that Green used, it made it easier for me to connect with the characters on a deeper level, because I also have a great love of reading. Yes, this book has two characters that have suffered from cancer, but that is in no way what this story is about. It’s about falling in love and living your life to the fullest because you never know when your last day is going to come. The story was full of hope, heartache, love, humor and honesty, I fell completely in love with everything about this book. For anyone that hasn’t read this book you really should, it has become one of my all-time favorite YA contemporary books.Notable Scene:“I’m in love with you,” he said quietly.“Augustus,” I said.“I am,” he said. He was staring at me, and I could see the corners of his eyes crinkling. “I’m in love with you, and I’m not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things. I’m in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we’re all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sub will swallow the only earth we’ll ever have, and I am in love with you.”FTC Advisory: Dutton/Penguin provided me with a copy of The Fault in Our Stars. No goody bags, sponsorships, “material connections,” or bribes were exchanged for my review."
5," don't know what it was about this book, but something kept saying, Read me! Read Me! In the New York Times article I write every Sunday (posted by noon or earlier), this book was on it a few weeks in a row. it enticed me! After a while, I 'had' to buy it and read it! So I did, and I am so glad I did! This is one book I will never forget.First, please consider this - as the description states, I want to warn you this book is about teenagers who are dying of cancer, or had cancer, are receiving treatment for it, or who are recovering from it. If you think you are going to read a book with a 'happily ever after' ending to it, then stop and don't read this book. Hazel says, But in fact, depression is not a side effect of cancer. Depression is a side effect of dying. (Cancer is a also a side effect of dying. Almost everything is, really.) Hazel has that right. We all ARE going to die one day, we just don't know how or when.There is a lot of great story in this book, so if you are able to read this, (and myself with losing three people this year, I had no problem reading this, but the people I lost were much older.) I surely would not miss this book! I think everyone would enjoy reading this book because the story is SO GOOD! I ended up LOVING this book. (Sounds kind of morbid to love a book where teenagers are dying, huh? But I did because of what happened throughout the book.) I LOVED this book!I think the close friendship these teens formed together was very appealing, especially Hazel and Augustus's. They were always there for each other, as the saying goes, through thick and thin. They could also relate to how the other felt. They knew what the others were going through, too, when it came to their cancers' in their lives, too.In the beginning, these teenagers (there are other characters you feel for, too) all become friends as their parents push them to go to a cancer support group because they are all having great difficulty with depression due to the side effect of cancer (which is where that quote comes in). I would have to agree with that, as I think I would have some depression from the cancer at any age, especially this age, the teenage years. These kids are literally staring at a death sentence, when they both should have their entire lives laid out in front of them.Augustus and Hazel both love this one series of books, especially the last book, but the author is not writing anymore series for it. This book is IT. It's over. They are both pretty upset by this and start to contact this author because they have many unanswered questions about it. An entire story develops from this, which is one you'll LOVE! You'll even get to go to Amsterdam in North Holland where the author lives! That was amazing!This book really pulls at your emotions, strongly. I think I went through an entire BOX of tissue reading this book! I really mean that when I say that, too, but it was not for the people I've personally lost in the past in my life, it was for these characters in this book. They are quite the people!Do yourself a favor and read this one! The GOOD TIMES will stay with you forever!"
5," This review appears on Happy Indulgence - check it out for more reviews at happyindulgencebooks.comTo my dear literary friends, there was never a doubt about it, but I understand why The Fault in Our Stars is a favourite novel of all time. It made me laugh with its dry humour, made me cry with its heart-breaking ending, fall in love with its young characters and most importantly, made me recognise the meaning of life in general.When health is not an issue, it’s easy to watch the days pass by, doing things out of habit or because we are simply going through the motions. How often we have a dream, only to never pursue it. How often we leave loose ends hanging, ending the day after an argument, or never telling our nearest and dearest that we love them.The Fault in Our Stars serves as a reminder that life is fleeting, and that death is a very real and major part of it, able to strike us at any time. The Fault In The Stars isn’t simply about cancer at its heart, it’s about two incredible young people who relish and enjoy life as it is, who just so happen to be affected by cancer.Hazel and Gus, being cancer sufferers, know that they do not have long to live. They devote their time telling their parents everyday that they love them, doing what they want and importantly, following their lifelong dreams. For Hazel, this is getting in touch with her favourite author, Peter Van Houlton and finding out what happens at the end of her favourite novel. Augustus Waters, known fondly as Gus, helps her achieve this dream with everything in his power to do so.The two love each other madly and unconditionally. Seeing them in their darkest moments was heart-wrenching and incredibly scary because its real. With unnerving strength of living with cancer, they help get through with having each other to lean on. I just loved how Hazel and Gus just chose to enjoy each others company and focus on their happiness, rather than creating unnecessary emotional drama that we see so often in novels these days….and in real life.Rather, they have enough going on with their health that they’re not going to sweat the small stuff, and do what they have to do to survive. That’s why when their cancer survivor – now blind friend Isaac deals with his pain by trashing all the trophies in Gus’s room, they just let him do it and egg him on. These characters are suffering in a very real way that we could only dream of understanding, and John Green captures it within the pages beautifully.Like so many others, I found Hazel and Gus to be very real, their strength, humour, and their charm to be riveting and touching. The story of meeting each other at a very fragile point in their lives and living and loving each other is heartbreaking and beautiful.The Fault in Our Stars is not a novel about cancer. It’s about a mutual love of literature, young love at its brightest, family support, chasing after your dreams, letting others in and giving them your whole heart and self – about the greatest parts of life itself."
5," “The Fault in Our Stars” written by John Green is a novel that will make you smile to tears and sadden you, a story that strikes right at the heart where it will remain long after you close its covers.The novel main character, girl named Hazel is sixteen years old, suffers from a malignant tumor and very short life remains in front of her. And after a medical miracle happens Hazel will get the chance to live longer than anyone had hoped, a few years that will give her a chance to feel at least a little bit of teenage life.Hazel will start going to meetings of Cancer Kid Support Group to meet kids who share the same problems and fears, in order to more easily accept the difficult and inevitable destiny before her.There she will meet Augustus, guy a year older than her, who defeated a sinister disease, but lost his leg. And although Hazel did not want that to happen because she is afraid that due to this she will suffer even more, the two of them will gradually become closer, first as best friends, and then a step further.Even though before her is battle that she has no chance of winning, Hazel will for the first time in her life feel immense happiness, will feel what it means to love sincerely, aware at all times that every day in front of her may be the last in which she will be with the one she loves more than anything…“The Fault in Our Stars” is an emotional story told in a wonderful way that will touch everyone who will come to its last page; and although it may be objected in some moments it's a bit unrealistic in terms of thinking, speech and behavior of young people in those age, the overall impression of Green’s novel is that this is an smart, convincing and realistic work that everyone should read.The end of the novel is very emotional and do not be surprised if you are like many readers worldwide wipe away the tears because no matter as much as we are taught that fairy tales do not happen in everyday life, Hazel and Augustus in a short time that they spent together wrote one.John Green wrote a novel that once you’ll read it will become the standard by which to measure how much you’re touched by some novel, and it’s difficult to give a better recommendation."
5," My 14 year-old granddaughter recommended this book to me and at first I was a little leery of reading a young adult book.  However, within the first ten pages I was hooked - complete hook, line, and sinker.  I could think of nothing else but reading this book.  I am on a cruise now and none of the activities could keep my mind off this book - it is that good.Hazel Grace is a teenager with metastasized thyroid cancer with metastasis in her lungs.  She must use an oxygen tank all day and a BiPAP machine all night.  Augustus Waters has Osteosarcoma and has just had a leg amputated.  They meet in a cancer support group and he falls for Hazel at first sight.  At first, Hazel keeps her distance from Gus, but it doesn't take her long to fall under his spell.  He is, after all, a hunk.The both of them are enamored of a book called An Imperial Infliction written by one Peter Houten.  The book is about a teenager with cancer.  It ends with a cliff hanger and they really want to know what happens after the puzzling ending.  Augustus uses his one wish wish with the Genies Foundation to ask for a trip to Amsterdam where Mr. Houten resides.  Miraculously, he gets his wish.  Unfortunately, the meeting with Mr. Houten is less than ideal.  Fortunately, the trip serves to increase the love and intimacy between Gus and Hazel.Grace and Gus are both very intelligent and philosophical people.  As Hazel says about Gus, To be with him was to hurt him - inevitably.  His last girlfriend died from a brain tumor and Grace is fearful that she will die and leave Gus in spiritual pain.  Hazel is always breathless because of the mets in her lungs.  She is in constant pain as well.  If she doesn't use her oxygen,  after about ten seconds, my lungs feel like they're folding in upon themselves like flowers at dusk.: She must have her lungs drained frequently.  The pain was always there, pulling me inside myself, demanding to be felt.Hazel feels outside the realm of ordinary people, the world of the well.  As she says, The physical evidence of disease separates you from other people.  We are irreconcilable other.  Gus is not obviously ill on the outside but Hazel carries around her oxygen tank everywhere she goes.  Since her illness she'd never considered a normal lifespan.  I'd never been anything but terminal;  all my treatment had been in pursuit of extending my life, not curing my cancer.  Gus has an 85% cure rate after his leg amputation but, like most survivors of cancer, lives in constant fear of a recurrence.  As Hazel says, My final chapter was written upon diagnosis. Gus, like most cancer survivors, lived with uncertainty.  Hazel sees herself as a 'grenade'.  Once she explodes with her cancer, all those around her will be harmed.One might think that a novel about two teenagers with cancer would be depressing.  This is not the case with this book.  Yes, it is powerful, has its sad and poignant moments, but it is uplifting and wonderfully life affirming.  It is an amazing book, one that is for everyone.  I am so glad that I read it.  I will remember it always."
5," There's a moment in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar when the Roman nobleman, Cassius, says to another nobleman, Brutus, The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves, that we are underlings. The context of Cassius' statement is that his and Brutus' unjust destinies are not the result of anything supernatural (something in the stars), but of their own poor choices.This is a statement that has held its place in culture, but author John Green's latest book seeks to dismantle this philosophy.Green  himself, in response to a reader's question, writes, . . . that's ridiculous. There is plenty of fault in our stars. Many people suffer needlessly not because they've done something wrong or because they're evil or whatever but because they get unlucky. I wanted to try to write a novel about how we navigate a world that isn't fair, and whether it's possible to have a full and meaningful life even if you don't get to play out your life on a grand stage the way Cassius and Brutus did (The Fault in Our Stars: Collector's Edition, 4).The Fault in Our Stars is a book starring Hazel Grace Lancaster, a 16 year old cancer survivor whose physical life has been left in shambles from her battle. Her lungs, as Hazel herself describes, suck and she is subjected to toting oxygen around wherever she goes. To say that she lives an abnormal teenage life would be a grand understatement.The novel takes off when Hazel attends a support group and meets another cancer survivor named Augustus Waters, a quick-witted, humorously-cynical 17 year old boy who quickly falls in love with her. The two embark on a philosophical journey together as they share their deepest emotions concerning the unjust landscape of their lives.POSITIVE ELEMENTSAugustus Waters is arguably one of the most lovable characters in modern day fiction. I recently told my wife that I wish he were real, because I would love to know him. He is the rare personality that brightens up life because he sees it from a unique angle. Some of the more humorous portions of the novel exist when Augustus sacrifices his video game avatar to save nonexistent, pixelated innocents. In so doing, his character naturally dies and he himself loses the game. But this is how Augustus plays the game, because it's how Augustus plays life. He is obsessed with the concept of dying an honorable, meaningful death, and has a difficult time reconciling how that is possible when one dies of cancer.It is Augustus that helps bring life to the dying protagonist, Hazel Grace. The friendship and relationship they foster is certainly a positive element to the story and although they both live on the diving board of death, together they are capable of standing firm on that slippery, flimsy board.SPIRITUAL CONTENTMuch of The Fault in Our Stars is spiritual. A quick Google search will reveal that John Green considers himself a Christian, although he allegedly doesn't like boxing himself in with this title. The support group takes place in a church, God is often alluded to, and Bible verses even appear here and there, albeit out of context.To say that the book paints an accurate picture of biblical Christianity, however, would be far-fetched. In fact, I would go as far as to say that God is often recreated and mocked. Augustus and Hazel would be what I consider nominal Christians. They seem to understand the basic concepts, like most Americans would, but they certainly don't live by godly standards. It is assumed that everyone goes to heaven and that those that die of cancer might even have a special place there, although, to be fair, the protagonists seem to deny this claim.The novel's title, in and of itself, suggests that there is fault with God's sovereignty in creation, and that mankind isn't responsible, or at least as responsible, as Shakespeare's Cassius alleged. Spiritually speaking, this is simply not the case. The fault is not in God (the stars), but a result of the Fall of Genesis 3. This is arguably my largest contention with the novel. Green assumes that all people are good and that things like cancer are unfair additions to life. While I would agree that cancer, and other evils like it, are horrible and devastating occurrences, we cannot ignore that such things are the inevitable result of mankind's decision to disobey God. Thus, Cassius was right. The fault is in ourselves.There are other claims about God in the novel, one being a fictional father in a fictional novel that the fictional author, Peter Van Houten, claims represents God (which isn't in good taste). But one of the more revealing aspects of Green's spiritual claims might be in an answer he gives to a reader in the Collector's Edition of his novel. Green writes that books belong to their readers, which, contextually speaking, was Green's way of saying that readers have the freedom to interpret elements of the story to their own desires. If this is a block of Green's foundation to his worldview, then it might explain how he interprets the Bible, which consequently affects much of what he believes it means to be a Christian, which affects his view of the stars.SEXUAL CONTENTThere is essentially one major sexual episode when Augustus and Hazel engage in premarital sex during their trip to Amsterdam. There are other episodes of various characters, including Augustus and Hazel, kissing.VIOLENT CONTENTThe book is inherently violent insofar as it is about kids with cancer, and Green pulls no punches in relating the facts about what a kid might go through when dealing with such a disease. In preparing for this book, Green spent time serving as a chaplain at a hospital with terminally ill children and wanted to convey the painful reality of death, not the graceful death often painted in other novels.CRUDE LANGUAGEThe novel includes various uses of s-t and d-m.DRUG AND ALCOHOL CONTENTNo drug content, but the characters, underage, do partake of champagne. To my recollection there are no scenes where the characters get drunk. Augustus often has a cigarette in his mouth, but he  never lights it. It is a metaphor that he is in control of his life and that this tool of death has no power over him.OTHER NEGATIVE ELEMENTSThe most negative elements of this novel rest in the influence it will undoubtedly bring to its young readers. Because it is such an engaging read and because the characters are so lovable, I can see many students learning from much of the fictional elements involved, treating them as truth. There are false concepts of mathematics (specifically claims on the philosophical understanding of infinity) and medicine, as well as misguided claims of biblical Christianity. There are also logically fallible philosophical claims that have little, if any, warrant. Green opens the book in writing, This book is a work of fiction. I made it up, but this does little to clarify what is real and what is not real in its claims.CONCLUSIONThe Fault in Our Stars is a very enjoyable read. It's hard to put down and it can be read quickly. I would not personally recommend it to any person younger than 16, and even with that (given my Christian faith), I would be cautious. It makes a variety of philosophical claims about life and can serve as a tool for philosophical discussions concerning gratuitous evils, which are conversations parents should have with their children. But it is my conviction that these conversations should be rooted and cultivated by Scripture, not fiction. Although, fiction is a fun way to add to the conversation after a firm foundation has been built in God's Word.I give the book 4 out of 5 stars."
5," The Fault In Our Stars by John Green. I would highly recommend this book to anyone around my age. This book was an immaculate read, from cover to cover. I was so impressed with John Green's genius plot thinking, motifs and the way he built each characters personality over the course of the book. The whole book was relatable through emotion. I gained this ability to feel almost the same way as the characters. It was almost as if I was looking though the main characters lenses. I found this deep relation between each character that made me think hard about my meaning to life. Hazel Grace Lancaster, the main character, is suffering from stage three thyroid cancer. She is not so much in it for the fight because of motivation, but simply because she has to be. She is surprisingly a laid back, low pressured character throughout the whole book, and doesn’t seem to dwell on that fact that she has cancer. Even though she does have cancer, the book seems to make readers focus on different events in the book. The cancer just seems to be, as Hazel puts it, “A side effect of dying.” The book contains many odd quotes that almost make you feel as if the author is playing with your brain. In a sense the book will be as good as readers want it to be. Through imagination, readers might think of profound explanations for each theme. Honestly, it was the opposite of cliché in that Hazel really told her story how it was. You live every day, but in the end your life just stops, without any warning, and mere expectance. When I finished this book, I kept on thinking about it. I had this emotional uprising in my heart that would constantly pound at me. I would ponder upon all the different things that had occurred. I dreaded the thought that any other book I picked up would ever meet the same feelings as this one. The reason why, struck me while I was writing this paper. I was feeling emotions identical to Hazel Grace! I was indeed the main character in this book. I know it sound like a stretch, but this is what John Green was trying to portray to his readers. That we are the main characters to every book because we are technically experiencing the events. We also are the ones who come up with conclusions and character identities. We basically write the book through our imagination, and become the main characters.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I highly recommend this book."
4,"ve had The Fault in Our Stars sitting on my shelf since its release day. Not because I didn't want to read it, with all of the buzz it was actually high on my to-read pile. Unfortunately, I just never got around to it until this week, and oh how I regret waiting so long to read this book.What can I say about The Fault in Our Stars that hasn't already been said? This book took me on an emotional roller-coaster that I'm not entirely sure I'll ever recover from.I started this book on Tuesday around 11PM, having just finished The Spectacular Now, and had real life not gotten in the way, I'm sure I would've finished TFiOS in one sitting. This book pulled me in, and all I wanted to do was to keep reading about Augustus and Hazel.What I loved most about The Fault in Our Stars was how Green constructed both Hazel and Augustus. Here you have these two kids, suffering from a terrible, terrible disease, and yet, they don't allow their disease to become them. They still know how to smile, to laugh, to live - and honestly, they bring out the best in one another. It isn't a cancer story, it's a story about two teenagers that just so happen to have cancer. In fact, it actually kind of reminded me of 50/50 in that it managed to balance the humor with the pain, and it did so wonderfully.I didn't understand why so many others had stated they bawled their eyes out while reading this until I came upon the scene at the gas station. That is the first time that we really get to see the vulnerable side of Augustus Waters, and it is absolutely heartbreaking. That scene - as well as the whole book, honestly - just felt so real. And the pain only grows from there on out.As for the ending... I honestly was expecting it to end mid-sentence, like I was fearing something would happen to Hazel, that her story would play out like Anna's, and that in the middle of reading, everything would just end, but not really end. Thankfully, that wasn't the case. The ending was actually beautifully written, and though I still have many questions, I'm satisfied with how Green ended their story.I'm not big into re-reading books, but this is one I can easily see myself re-reading time and time again."
5," This book consumed me. I've been hearing about it for months and I knew ever since I read the description that I must read this book. So I put it on my wish list and waited for the price to drop. The moment I did, I bought it and read it in one day.It's going on my favorite books ever list. Not kidding. I have recommended this book to everyone I meet since I finished it. The story is beautiful and moving. The characters wormed their way deep into my heart. I felt every moment with them.Some people have said the characters are pretentious and that teenagers do not act that way. As someone not so far removed from her teen years (I'm about 7 years older than Hazel), I would politely disagree. Teens are smart, witty, and some of them do have expansive vocabularies. But I would also like to point out that Hazel and Augustus are not normal teens.They both have cancer, which has a profound impact on not only their own lives, but many of the lives around them. Not only does our lead, Hazel, have cancer, but she is terminal. She is sixteen years old and is dying. At 16 most of us believe that we are invincible and that we will never die. It's a part of developmental psychology. However for Hazel, this is not true. She has completely skipped that developmental stage in her life (along with several others) and gone all the way to the last one. She is faced with death at an age where it isn't even thought about. Of course she seems older. Cognitively, she is.I love how this book contains cancer, but the story isn't about cancer. It's about two kids living with the time they have been given. They're doing what most of us aren't able to and making the most of things. They see things and treasure things that healthy people aren't even noticing. This book is not about death. It is about living.Yes, it is sad. Yes, I sobbed for the last quarter of it. It is a beautifully written book. The story is believable and poignant. It really hits home, because I can understand this. I have seen this. It's more than a tragic love story, because I think it would have been even more tragic if Hazel would have never loved at all.All I can say is read it. It's been almost a month since I did and it is still resonating deeply with me. It is a remarkable and beautiful book."
5," Hazel has never been anything but terminal...but when...Augustus Waters suddenly appears at Cancer Kid Support Group, Hazel's story is about to be completely rewritten. I was already rolling my eyes by the time I scanned the book flap; disliking this novel would be like telling someone you liked smothering puppies. How can you hate a story about kids with cancer?As a pediatrician who spends much of my day caring for hospitalized children, many whom are chronically ill just like Hazel Grace and Augustus, I'm always leery toward attempts to capture what it means to be a terminally ill young adult. Often such portrayals can seem sentimental and emotionally manipulative--in part to the grand Dalai Lama of Melodrama, Eric Segal, who essentially invented the genre with Love Story, published over 40 years ago. Indeed, it's now the middle-aged granddaddy of them all. Love Story (both the novel and film) set the stage for all succeeding contemporary cancer dramas. One can't evoke the image of a stricken Jenny Cavalleri in the bed, Oliver Barrett IV dutifully keeping watch by her bedside, without the music playing in the background, without the line which has now become a tired cliche: love means never having to say to you're sorry.Love, in fact, does nothing of the sort. There are plenty of things to be sorry about when dealing with love, and terminal illness, both things said and unsaid, near the end. Thus, how do you tackle such a tragedy with grace and humor, while avoiding sentiment and melodrama, yet keeping true to the tragedy? Exactly how John Green has done it here. Hazel Grace and Augustus are instantly real, and their voices and characters felt alive to me from the first scenes. Sure, they speak precociously, beyond their years with thoughts and language, but Green uses this license to advantage--after all, they both indeed are beyond their years in the deepest and most gravest sense. A sideline plot twist with a mysterious author who resides in Amsterdam was the only part I found less interesting; still, Green kept me going until the end. I really felt like he inhabited the world in which many of my patients find themselves trapped in, with his attention to details, the oncologic lingo. The way in which teenagers speak and live. The hospital is a place which Hazel Green and Augustus have both grown up in, and come of age in--stealing what little chance they've had at childhood. Green's characters are never flat, they're richly drawn, which makes this story even more damningly tragic. It made me want to be a better doctor."
2," THE FAULT IN OUR STARS by JOHN GREENIt depends on your perspective really. I have no idea what the story of this book is all about when I decided to start reading it but I'm not disappointed. Not at all. I am writing this right after I finished the beautiful book. Like I said, PERSPECTIVE. You may say that the book is morbid, sad, funny, unfair but I would like to think that it has a very beautiful story about love &amp; life. Yes, it's also funny. The humor is palpable and so is sadness. Even in dying, you can still find a way to joke around and laugh and it's not a bad thing. We all have ways of coping and that means your sanity is still intact.IDK bout you but while reading this book, I have a lot of questions bout life and one is, WHY BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO PEOPLE? I know there are Augustus &amp; Hazel out there and maybe have the same situation (or had) but don't you think it's unfair? I mean, I want them to have a good life. There are people in this world who doesn't deserve to live but still they exist. I just don't understand. I don't understand the lesson in it. And I think, I will never will. Not unless God appear in front of me right now and answer my questions.Dying. Death. It's also part of the book. Some (maybe most) people don't like to talk about death because it makes them sad. I don't know what's the difference in grieving if a person you love dies compared to your dog being dead. But from what I experienced from our dog dying last year, it was very exhausting and very, very sad. I know I just compared a person to a dog but I really don't have anything to compare it to. I will never be prepared if my mom or brother dies, no one can be prepared for any of that (I think) but if someone will tell me right now that I will be dead in a month, I will be grateful. Why? It means I still have time to do what I want and to tell the people I love that I love &amp; appreciate them.Grief does not change you. It reveals you.Like Peter Van Houten's An Imperial Affliction, I guess will never know what happened to Hazel after reading Gus' letter. But unlike Hazel (she wants to know the ending of Van Houten's book), in this story, I do not. Obviously, she will die but I'd like to think she died contented. Having to meet the love of her life even in a short time is good enough. I would rather live in a short time knowing I experienced that kind of love &amp; joy with Gus than live long and not have any of it. Yes, it's unfair. Duh. Life is a bitch, haven't you noticed? But what makes life worth living is having all the unexpected things that makes your heart flutter &amp; makes you smile everyday. So yes, life is unfair but it's worth it. And Hazel said, I do and that means she doesn't regret meeting Gus and her decision to love him.Some infinities are bigger than other infinities.♥ You don't get to choose if you get hurt in this world, old man, but you do have some say in who hurts you. I like my choices. I hope she likes hers.- Augustus Waters ♥** Also posted on my TUMBLR &amp; GR account"
5," This book was one that I tried to avoid reading at first because I know that the story, kind of hits home. My younger brother was diagnosis with cancer four years ago, and although he is healthy now (I am grateful everyday for this, even when he is being a moody teenager) I can never forget that dark time in my life when everyday I wondered if this day will be his last. With that said, I also notice that this book is one of John Green's most popular, and since I loved the other two books that I have read from him (Paper Towns, Looking for Alaska) I wanted to give this one a try.Well, I absolutely loved this book. It was amazing from start to finish. First off, I love John's or should I say Hazel's take on cancer and death. She gets annoyed with people viewing cancer patients as being these wholly beings only capable of of good, and how powerful these patients' strength are. In reality, cancer sucks, and those who are not sick feel uncomfortable around those that are. They don't want to be seen as these warriors, but as normal people and that can truly never be. I like how honest Hazel is, and how John portrays her as a teenager who wants to live life rather than a cancer patient waiting for death to take her away in his chariot. She is honest, funny, and strong-all of these traits having nothing to do with her sickness, but in the person that she is. Hazel is not a girl with cancer, she is just a girl.Augustus Waters, oh my goodness, one of my favorite characters ever...in any book. His sense of humor, charm, and outlook on life shines through the pages. I wish I could meet someone like him in real life, someone who makes the world better just by merely existing.The characters, this world, and their troubles are all very vivid and real. I came into this book, excepting to be really depressed-as the topic of cancer is always saddening-but I didn't except to also laugh and fall in love with these characters. At such a young age, Hazel, Augustus and Issac know more about life than most people do.There was quite some twists and turns in this book, and there were times when the reveals were made that really surprised me.Out of all the books I've read, and being a book lover I have read many, I have not encountered characters like the ones in this book. Characters that are so real and charismatic despite their situations, characters that refuse to live inside a book, characters that demand to be analyzed and remembered, and characters that I know will always stay with me.The Fault in Our Stars, is fantastic, but then again I wouldn't expect any less from John Green."
5," Okay, guys, I've been holding out on you. I finished this amazing book that most of you have probably already read (and if you haven't, you need to), but I just couldn't bring myself to review it. The Fault in Our Stars, wow, well I knew it dealt with cancer and people said it sounded like a Lurlene McDaniel book...so it's been on my to-read list forever. I finally bought the ebook version when it went on sale for 3.99 on Amazon. I had so many other things to do and read before I started that book, so I just opened one page just to see what it was like, and I was instantly sucked in to the story. First, although I love Lurlene, the writing style is way different. It paints what I believe to be the cold hard truth of cancer --- you're scared, not brave. You have no choice but to put on that brave face for others, but internally it's frightening. So many stories (not always Lurlene's, but others) dealing with cancer kind of glorify the `victim', like they're so wonderful and perfect and strong...when really, they're human like the rest of us, and John Green captures that perfectly. Hazel Grace is a cancer `survivor', though the cancer is still there, dwelling in her lungs. She walks around with an oxygen tank, as reclusive as her mother will allow, and is forced to attend a cancer support group. It is there that she meets Augustus Waters, another cancer survivor who had the unfortunate experience of losing a limb. The two hit it off, and soon enough they're talking about a favorite book of Hazel's --- analyzing it and discussing the `ending'. Their friendship/relationship deepens, but as Hazel gets sicker and sicker, Augustus gives Hazel what he hopes to be a wonderful gift...but sadly, the world is not a wish granting factory. The writing style is so raw and real. I cannot wait to read John Green's other books. Five stars, for sure!"
5," am not going to recap the story, because that has been done a thousand times- but I do want to express to you, the reader, the effects that this book had on me.I felt guilty after having listened to the audiobook version of this. The Fault In Our Stars is a book that deserves to be read and not just listened to. To take the side of Peter van Houten, we can get lost in the day-to-day mundanity of having all this information at our fingertips, that it is all readily accessible. In a way, it takes the romance out of the experience of this book. That is not to say that the audiobook version was bad, but quite the contrary. The narrator, Kate Rudd, did an outstanding job; she had the attitude and spunk of a teenage girl, but could also project emotions that made you cry. I mean this literally - not want to cry, but to actually breakdown and start crying.I can't quite explain to you how much I thoroughly enjoyed this book, the only way I know how to describe this is to let you know that this is my first review over a book. I have read through all of the Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow books, Game of Thrones, Divergent, Hunger Games, Harry Potter, Odd Thomas series, and several more that I can't think of right now. I read every book in all of those series, and loved every one of them. While I kept finding favorites among those series, this book tops them all. I have felt sad, and have laughed while reading books before but this was different. I don't know how to explain that after finishing the last of the book, I had a lump in my throat for at least 4 hours. Just recalling the book long enough to write this review has reformed the lump.The emotions in this book felt surreal, such that John Green knew exactly how to play me like an instrument - picking out individual notes that resonated within my innermost self. Do yourself a treat and read this book, you will not regret it."
5," have a confession to make. Although I am a high-school literature teacher, I cannot stand most of the contemporary YA novels that my students read and talk about. I try, I really do, but all that follows is disappointment. Hunger Games started well, but crashed and burned as the series progressed. That's more than can be said for Matched or Divergent, books that stumbled at the starting line. My faith for the next generation of readers dwindled.....I asked myself, Would they ever have a book worthy of being read by generations to follow? An ambitious question, I know, but an important one. After all, my generation had The Giver and Hatchet, which are heavily taught in schools today. Well, Millennials, I have good news for you; you now have your once-in-a-generation YA novel.The Fault in Our Stars is the rare book that doesn't talk down or present a dumbed-down world to its target audience. John Green presents the world as it is today, with its pain, its ugliness, and its beauty. And he presents two teenagers who memorize poetry, wax philosophically, obsess over obscure books, and contemplate oblivion; though these types of kids may seem rare today (thank you 24-hour news cycles and reality television for failing to present the Millennials in any but the most negative of lights); in my experience, this type of teenager is far more common than adults are led to believe.The critics of this book surely have some qualms about this novel. Allow me to counter these well-meaning yet misguided critics: Yes, this book has teenage drinking; yes, this book presents teenage sex; yes, this book features teenagers dying. But John Green presents all three of these with a care and a delicacy that would give teenage readers time to pause and contemplate(by the way, teens are hardly an impressionable and naive group, as they are exposed to these concepts in far more vulgar ways everywhere else they look in the world today).Furthermore, this novel features no vampires or otherworldly beings, no ill-conceived love triangles, no damsel-in-distress, no unnecessary, bloated sequels, and, most thankfully, no young protagonists forced to kill in order to save the world from some dystopian nightmare. The impact these young protagonists leave might be minimal in their own fictional yet all-too-familiar world (which they themselves admit in the novel), but their impact on my life, and on the lives of countless other readers of this book, is substantial."
5," 5 stars plus (spoiler-ish)Let me start this review by saying that this will be my first, honest, indepth review. Also, let me say that I now truly understand what an honest-to-god 5 plus star book is.I have been seeing people mention how everyone should read the fault in our stars and I was hesitant at first after reading the premise on amazon. I knew this book would be intensely emotional, and honestly I didn't want to drag myself down to those depths while dealing with a bout of sadness myself. I'm glad that I took the chance to read this book.The book starts off with us meeting our heroine hazel who is a bit of a Debbie downer but in all actuality a realist. She has been dealt a shit lot in life and is left basically going through the motions. Her mom, the typical clingy mom one can expect when faced with losing an only child, and dad, the thought provoking crier, are supporting characters who add a ton of depth and insight to the book. After being somewhat forced to go to a support group for cancer survivors, hazel meets one Augustus Winters, who from first sight brought Hazel out of her pessimism and taught her to live her life.  Their story is beautifully intertwined while we go through their development into love that some of us wish we can experience.  At the risk of not wanting to spoil the book for anyone, i must say that I cried during about 2/3 of the book and at most of those jags of crying I had a lump the size of Texas in my throat. The book is, as expected, tragically sad but adds a plethora of poignant quips to help the reader truly think about our lives and how we fit in them.One such poignant quip is the voracious ambition of humans is never sated by dreams coming true, because there is always the thought that everything might be done better and again.The book seems to somewhat parallel the book within, whereas it seems to end in the middle, not like a dreaded cliffhanger, but to let the reader see what they think of as the ending. We aren't left with as many open ended questions as in an imperial affliction, we find out what mom and dads lives will entail after Hazel dies, but we never actually experience her death. I like to think that she was able to live as well as possible and died a somewhat painless death. But that's just what I hope.I know this review might seem jumbled up and all over the place, but I feel since Mr. Green took the time to write such a beautifully tragic book, that's easily 5 stars if not more, then I can take the time to express my gratitude for it. Thank you Mr. John Green."
5," Dear John Green,You. Are. Killing. Me.  I read The Fault in Our stars yesterday in less than 24 hours.  Although I think this book deserves much more reflection than a mere matter of hours, I couldn't help myself.  I literally could not put the book down.  It's a good thing it was a Saturday and my husband was here; otherwise, my children would have had to fend for themselves due to a neglectful mother.In the last two weeks, I've read Paper Towns, Looking for Alaska and The Fault in Our Stars.  The latter is BY FAR my favorite.  I also shed more tears reading it than I have cumulatively for the last year.  You just had to do that to us, didn't you John Green?  Now, I have read many reviews that critique you for using a formula in your writing.  And yes, it is true that I see many resemblances between these three books (more so in Paper Towns and Looking for Alaska).  But with that, I have also encountered writing that is so profound, thought-provoking and downright funny that it's hard to criticize.  I actually laughed out loud several times while reading this.  I mean really, only you could make a one-legged cancer victim irresistibly hot.  And clever.  And naively romantic.  And brilliant.  Oh man...But truly, the manner in which you delicately yet honestly handled the oh-so-scary matter of cancer was beyond commendable.  And it's not just people who have had cancer or known someone with cancer or studied cancer that can appreciate this book.  Anyone who has experienced pain, grief, love or loss will glean wisdom from this story.I also want to thank you for making both of the main characters incredibly likeable.  No Margos or Alaskas here.  Augustus and Hazel were both...how do I put this?  Freaking awesome!!  Not without flaws, but still kind, original, funny (albeit a little strange) people.  They became real to me, which I think is the intent of good writing.So thank you John Green.  Even though you made me sob like a child, I don't think I can adequately express how wonderfully fantastic this book is.  You are something else.Until next time,Brittney"
5," Sixteen-year-old Hazel is living with stage four thyroid cancer with mets in her lungs. Well, she's not really living, she's just getting from one day to the next. She attends a cancer support group because her parents think she's depressed. Well, hey.. I think it's natural to feel a certain degree of depression fighting cancer and toting around a portable oxygen tank for three years. With a revolving door at her support group, due to everyone having cancer and all, Hazel is used to seeing old faces disappear and new ones pop up in their place. Meeting Augustus Waters changed everything, though. Hazel would never be the same person she was before that day.I've had an emotional day -- combine that with PMS and I'm probably going to cry through this review process. In fact, you're in luck because I'm not going to write a novel about a novel today. It's not that this was a terribly sad book. I mean, it is because it deals with a very emotional topic, but the author makes it the most amusing heavyhearted book possible, if that makes sense. I think it's because the overall story is so beautiful it brings tears to my eyes.I love the characters in The Fault in Our Stars. Hazel is truly awesome with her quirkiness and her brilliant mind. She's determined, even if she doesn't always know where her resolve is aimed. It was a lot of fun getting to know her. Augustus (Gus) is equally fabulous and flawed, almost as if he was created to be Hazel's male counterpart. Their interaction is priceless, and something that I will not soon forget. Even the secondary characters make my heart pitter-patter. Very well-rounded plot and character development right here.I don't know why it took me so long to pick up a copy of this book. I've seen EVERYONE talk about it for at least a year, but never made the time. I'm so glad I finally did. This is a compelling tale about one girl's journey into a whole new chapter of her life, one that may not have happened if circumstances were different. I highly recommend The Fault in Our Stars to everyone with eyes capable of reading - no pun intended. Well, maybe a little. There's always the braille option, though. Is this book available in braille, Mr. Green?"
5," avoid this type of book like the plague.I'm overly sensitive to negative emotions...not kidding, it rips me apart. This book was worse than most because it was so well written, so real, i loved the characters and felt the loss and grief like they were real people...it's hard for me to say this because men just aren't supposed to admit these things. Ever.Intelligent, witty characters are very difficult to pull off, you have to be witty and intelligent to do it. This author has these skills in excess, crushing your soul in one line, making you laugh through tears with the next.The narration was so good that at the point i would normally walk away, i couldn't stop...and the thing ripped me apart and left me broken, real tears, real grief, real pain in my chest...i've known real grief in my life and i'm telling you this felt just as painful for me, luckily ten minutes after the audiobook ended the realization it was just a book took away the grief and the pain...and i felt stupid for getting so sucked in.I'm sure the printed version is great, i could have put down a printed book so easily when i realized where this one was going...but, Audible audiobooks give you a trained narrator that make you believe you're there, in real life, and it will pull you in much deeper when the characters actually speak to you with real voices. This woman was good, real good, Kate Rudd is a narrator that gives the world goose bumps, like Pavarotti, or Elvis define the term legends...her portrayal of both male and female teenagers is second to none in skill and will convince you absolutely.I am wrung out after listening to this audiobook...inspired to write about it, and even admitting to blubbering like a baby....damn you, John Green...If for some bizarre reason you revel in quirky, romantic,sad tales with happy endings then by all means, buy the Audio version of this book...but be warned, it is powerful, it is deceptive, it will suck you in and rip the heart, still beating, from your chest...seek psychiatric attention for yourself if this appeals to you."
5,"ve had this book suggested to me a lot. Well, I'm trying to read a YA set in every state, and encourage ideas, and so it's not odd that this was the popular pick for Indiana. I hesitated, because I could tell it was going to be sad.I'm not opposed to sad stories, but I have to be in the right emotional place to read them. Still, it soon became clear that TFiOS had moved a lot of people. It has to be my Indiana.I should point out that I sometimes use the option on my Fire to listen to the Audible version of the book as I read. Yeah, I'm the one who does that, the only one. :) So, I have to say that the narration was terrific.TFiOS was an unnaturally good read. Funny, moving, thought-provoking, and strangely life-affirming. Yes, I cried, but it was worth it, because the tears were honest and earned, and not based on author manipulation -- or at least I didn't see the strings. These are likable characters, and unfair things happen to them that really happen to people every single day. People say God never gives us more than we can handle, but the jury is still out on that one. Bad things often pile on top of other bad things, for whatever reason ... or no reason at all.I've read some criticism that the characters act too old, but I don't think so. There are smart kids in the world, and Hazel and Augustus have more reason than most to know they have to do what they find important, be the people they want to grow up to be, right now. This is particular true of Augustus, who tried harder than most to be his best self.I loved the time spent with these characters, enough to cyber-stalk the author. This is my non-threatening homage to authors I like involving binging on past interviews, and what have you. Since he has a prolific vlog with his brother, this will take months. :) (And that makes me happy.)DFTBA -- Don't forget to be awesome.(If you have a suggestion for terrific YA, the middle of America is pretty wide open -- please feel free to add a comment.)"
2," While I understand that this blog is primarly for adult genred books, I feel like sometimes we run across a book that transcends all genres and that everyone should read. A Fault in Our Stars is that book. It is so well written, intense, and impactful that anyone 15-100 would be touched and love this book.The PositivesThis book follows Hazel, a 16 year old that is living with Stage IV cancer and not much else. She sits at home with her mom and dad, reading, and watches America's Next Top Model. The thing about Hazel is that even though she has given up being regular because of the cancer, it does not affect her sense of humor. She is a really witty and fun girl to be with, and the cancer does not really define that part of her. She reminds me of a girl that I used to teach that is surviving cancer. She is so intelligent and does not let cancer affect her personality. She is not a girl with cancer, she is a girl....who happens to be sick. Hazel is an inspiration to everyone.Hazel meets Augustus Waters at a cancer support group meeting and pretty much falls head over heels in love with him in like the first 10 minutes of meeting him. He is bright, funny, and pretty much the male equivalent of Hazel. They hit it off right away and have a brilliant relationship. I will not give too much of the book away, but he is a dream guy and a great catch. I love his attitude and the way he leads his life. He is top notch.The thing I like most about the book is the emotions that Green delves into. You feel joy, anger, and most of all heart-wrenching sadness while you are going through the life of these two young people. The relationship between the two of them is so sweet and tender, they are in love and that makes your heart swell. Then by the end of the book , you are ugly girl crying. I actually clutched the book in my arms and rocked back and forth while bawling when the book was finished. It is a roller coaster of emotions, but in a most awesome and powerful way.The NegativesThe only thing that I wished was done differently was I wish there was an epilogue that let us know how Hazel was doing after the conclusion of the book. Did she go into remission? Did her lungs stop filling up with so much fluid? Did she die? I hate being left hanging when I am invested in a character.The VerdictMake this book one of your number 1's right away! It is worth a place on your bookshelf. EVERYONE in the world must read this book!See the review at [...]"
5," don't even know where to start with this book... it's kind of one of those I'm still shell-shocked after experiencing emotional trauma at the hands of a book but I have to explain why that was one of the best experiences ever. But I'll do what I can.Simply put, John Green is the kind of author that speaks TO you very deeply, not AT you like a lot of authors. You get the sense when reading his work like he's writing a story not just for the money or because his readers expect it of him, but because he wanted to speak to you. To communicate with you, as the reader, and to tell you something that's important to him. We all know John Green is an adult, but the way he writes, he is very clearly still a kid at heart. He sees things the way teenagers see things, and not in that overdramatic, cliche way a lot of authors fall into. He tells it like it's real. And you feel like it's real when you read it.Something I learned from taking creative writing classes in college, is that not every story has to be sweeping and epic and suspenseful and deeply plot-oriented. The best books are oftentimes the books we relate to the most, with people in relate-able situations. There doesn't always have to be a traumatic crisis by page seven, or a budding proletariat revolution by page fifteen. Sometimes all you need is story, a believable experience of someone in everyday life just trying to survive in this world. John Green has landed himself squarely in that golden zone. He's made the story meaningful without making it grand, and engrossing without making it grossly overdone. And in a sense, this makes it feel more real to the reader than any YA novel about teens saving the world with their newly discovered powers of magic and their devastatingly attractive male cohort.Another thing I adore about Mr. Green's writing is that though he writes for a young adult audience, he writes intelligently. Not just intelligently, but with a certain level of genius. Several times throughout the book I would literally have to put it down and sit there for a minute, just absorbing what he said. He would have these unexpected pockets and moment of profundity that would catch you off guard in the best ways. Most of the story is composed with wit and humor and then sometimes he'll just hit you with it--a philosophical nugget that enriches the entire experience. It's like biting into a cookie and then finding the inside is full of chocolate. It's almost like reading a mix of a YA book and a book on philosophy. It's precisely awesome. What makes it even better is that John Green doesn't try to dumb anything down for you. Unlike a lot of authors with shallow plots and characters and barely any actual intelligence in the writing, John actually talks to you like you're a smart adult, not just a teenager. He believes that his readers are as smart as anyone else, and that's quite gratifying to read. He doesn't try to dumb anything down for you. It's all there, and it makes you think, and I believe that is something that makes this book (and Mr. Green's other stories) very special.Of course the issue many people who don't like the book address is the problem of Hazel and Augustus not talking or sounding like believable teenage characters. I admit that most teenagers are not as thoughtful, intelligent, profound, or use as big of vocabulary as these characters. However, John Green is not completely off base. I can say from personal experience that teenagers can be that smart. I was one of them, or at least I spent a lot of my time around them in high school and now in college. So while Hazel's and Augustus's level of sophistication and grammatical aptitude is somewhat unusual, it's not completely abnormal. (Also note that several times, Augustus will use big words in the wrong context. Mr. Green says he did this on purpose, because Augustus is a character who tries hard to be grand but still is not in many ways. He just wants to be. As John Green said, I don't think Hazel or Gus necessarily have particularly high IQs (Gus in particular is constantly misusing words). I just think they're intellectually curious). In short, even if it was unusual, I thought it made it better. For once, teenagers in YA books aren't just average and ditsy and content with their limited knowledge of their universe. Augustus and Hazel want to know more and strive to be more, and I love it.Anyway, I have probably rambled for long enough, but I could probably write essays upon essays about why I adore this book and why it is an astoundingly great piece of literature. But suffice to say, John Green has created a masterpiece, and I believe it will rest forever in a prominent place on the history shelves of phenomenal literature."
5," have broken John Green ground, finally! Thank you to everyone who voted for this book during my April book poll. As difficult as this book was, I thank you all for giving me the push to finally dive in. I am happy to have finally experienced John Green's brilliance. He certainly knows how to tell a story, and more importantly, how to write characters.Hazel and Augustus. I am not even sure what to say about these two characters that would prove the magnitude of their presence and spirit in this book. Both are afflicted with different types of cancers, in different stages and with different outcomes. Both have been through utter hell and continue to experience the physical and emotional pain and suffering of terminal illness. However, there are times where I would not have even remembered they were sick, had it not been for Hazel's need for oxygen and Augustus' limp. When they found one another, they both started to truly live again. And live they did. They had big moments and small moments and glorious moments and devastating moments. But they experienced them all together, basking in the glow of their new found love and respect. That for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health marriage vow was never more apparent in any story than it was with Hazel and Augustus. And they were teenagers who were not married, nor thinking about it. There was just so much truth and honesty inside them both that it burst out to envelop the other. Not to mention, they were like two peas in a pod. It's definitely hard to put into words the perfect imperfection these two characters were together.And I just have to talk about Augustus all by his onesies. This young man was AH-mazing. He was full of lust for life, and despite his illness, lived life to the absolute fullest. Never once did I see negativity or pessimism cross this young man's thoughts. He was romantic and nerdy and fun. He was also very compassionate and humble. This guy had it all, and I will never forget what a beautiful character he is, and how much he made my heart smile in this book.This book was much more than a book about kids with cancer. It was about living life and taking risks and being in love and exploring the world and enjoying beauty and the inner strength people can muster when life hands them a basket full of lemons.  Believe it or not, I did not ugly cry. My eyes teared up, and I put the book down numerous times to gather myself, but I did not sob myself to sleep. I held on tightly to the beauty of the character's life-altering experiences, and it got me through the book. I am really happy that I've been digging my heels into YA contemporary books more than I ever have. There are some incredible gems out there and I look forward to reading all of John Green's work.Favorite SceneMay I see you again? he asked. There was an endearing nervousness in his voice.I smiled. Sure.Tomorrow? he asked.Patience, grasshopper, I counseled. You don't want to seem overeager.Right, that's why I said tomorrow, he said. I want to see you again tonight. But I'm willing to wait all night and much of tomorrow. I rolled my eyes. I'm serious, he said.You don't even know me, I said. I grabbed the book from the center console. How about I call you when I finish this?But you don't even have my phone number, he said.I strongly suspect you wrote it in this book.He broke out into that goofy smile. And you say we don't know each other."
5," have been wanting to read this book for a long time.  It was an absolutely wonderful read.  It was at turns hilarious and heartfelt; I laughed a number of times and cried a few as well.Hazel is sixteen and on a drug that is holding her cancer at bay, but just barely.  Her lungs don't work and she needs oxygen to breath, but she is going to school and taking it one day at a time.  That is until Augustus Waters limps into Cancer Kid Support Group with his 80% survival rate and a wicked wink.  Hazel doesn't want to get involved but she just can't help herself.Yes this book is about teen kids with cancer, but it is surprisingly hilarious despite it's somewhat somber topic.  Hazel has a snarky and hilariously dark sense of humor.  She sees dark humor in everything from the Cancer Group's continually rotating attendance (because you know a lot of the kids die off) to the sad fact that their councilor's best accomplishment of his rather boring life is having survived testicular cancer.Somehow rather than pitying Hazel  you empathize with her and laugh along with her as she struggles to make a life with this crazy hand she's been dealt.  Green does an excellent job of covering a number of issues for this kind of situation.  Hazel is very smart and emotionally mature.  One of the things she is most concerned about is being a burden on those she loves. At one point she says something to the effect of After all, the only thing worse than being a kid with cancer is being the parent of a kid with cancer.Watching Hazel interact with her parents is really interesting too.  She's an only child.  Her dad is excessively emotional and breaks into tears at the slightest emotional tumult (good or bad).  Her mother basically has a full time job managing Hazel's doctor appointments and care.  Her parents love her and try hard not to hover and this is portrayed really well in this book.  Hazel never gets really rebellious, but her and her mother do get into some very typical mom/teen arguments.The other characters in this book are just as interesting and engaging as Hazel.  Augustus of course is in the story a ton; he is a happy-go-lucky type of guy who is absolutely drawn to Hazel right from the get go.  He draws her out of her comfort zone to a place where she gets to experience something she never would.Isaac is another major character in this book.  He is struggling with eye cancer and is getting ready to undergo a surgery that will require the removal of his other eye...making him blind.  Watching him cope with this along with all your other typical teenage problems was interesting; he was a very engaging character as well.It was awesome both how extraordinary and ordinary these kids are.  They are all just making their way through life and trying to deal with all the stuff we are all trying to deal with day to day, with some extra junk thrown in.I won't talk a lot about the plot except to say it builds up to Hazel getting to fullfill one of her lifelong dreams.  There are many twists and turns along the way.  The ending is hopeful, realistic, and heartbreaking all at once.  This story is incredibly engaging, well written, and hard to put down.  I stayed up super late to finish this book.Overall an amazing and excellent book that manages to be hilarious and heartfelt all at the same time.  It puts the reader through such an emotional roller-coaster; you will laugh out loud a ton...you will cry some too.  I really really enjoyed it.  It takes a wonderful author to write such a fabulous book that deals with such a tough topic and yet makes it hilarious, absolutely heartfelt, and engaging.  Strongly recommended for everyone to read!"
5," This book was amazing in many ways. It had thought-provoking quotes that really made you think about the meaning of life. I was introduced to this book because I was reading for my summer reading assignment and so all the quotes were great for my double-entry journals. What I also like is that this is not your typical teenage love story. It's more than that. It's not just that Gus has a prosthetic leg or Hazel has horrible lungs. It's that in their time when they were coming to an end, they wound their two lives together and created a loving, caring relationship. One thing I don't understand though is how the couple is far ahead of their age. The way they talk and the words they use. Then I realized, cancer makes you grow fast. Not physically (well maybe, depending on what type of cancer you have) but mentally. For Augustus, he knew his time was coming to an end so he matured quickly. For Hazel, because of her lungs and her oxygen tank, she knew she couldn't be a normal teenager so she became unique in a way. She lived in her own alternate universe that she shared with Augustus. Lastly, I want to say that this book made me cry. Now it takes a lot for me to cry, especially if it's a book. I recommend this book for anyone who likes thinking a lot (philosophers basically). If you like thinking about life and if you enjoy reading simple quotes about life, this is for you. Now let me just say,  THIS IS BOOK IS NOT FOR TEENAGERS ONLY. Don't let the teenage fiction sign confuse you. This book is for both teens and adults as well. For teens, it will show a world different from the ones they usually see every day. They will get to see what real love is. For adults, they can see the world of teens, how it is to live with cancer, etc. Overall, I give this book 5 stars. More in fact, if I could. It was just so good! John Green is an amazing writer. This is so far one of the best books ever!"
5," ** This review, as well as many more, can also be found on my blog, The Baking Bookworm (www.thebakingbookworm.blogspot.ca) **My Thoughts: This is a book that I noticed months ago while perusing the aisles at my local Chapters and it was put on my 'TBR (To Be Read) List' immediately.  It's gotten a lot of hype (which may or may not be the kiss of death for a book).  In this case the hype is warranted.This was a touching read.  Even though you know it's going to be a sad book (it deals with teenagers with cancer-ravaged bodies) and will, most likely, deal with death it doesn't detract from enjoying this book.  You'd think that a book that focuses on a group of teens with cancer would be a huge tear fest from beginning to end but for the most part this book was funny and, in a strange way, uplifting and oh so very touching.  Yes, it's a veritable roller coaster of emotions.  But it works.For me, what makes this book stand out are the characters.  Not only are Hazel and Augustus well-rounded and completely engaging characters but the secondary characters, including Isaac and the sets of parents, are all complete and give believable voices to the book.  It's these characters and their relationships with each other that truly shine in this book.Let's get back to Hazel and Augustus.  I loved Hazel from the first line of the book.  Her dry wit,sarcasm and humour.  Loved her.  Augustus held his own too and I adored their hilarious banter.  He had some amazing lines in the book that I immediately wrote down because they were just 'that good'.  Here's some of my favs ...Oh, I wouldn't mind, Hazel Grace. It would be aprivilege to have my heart broken by you.But, while not all stories have happy endings,it doesn't make their journey any less beautiful.That's the thing about pain... It demands to be felt.Some infinities are bigger than other infinitiesI love you present tenseSome would argue that 'normal teenagers' don't speak like Hazel and Augustus.  I know that I didn't sound quite so cool at that age but, man, would I loved to have been!  I will admit that they had a certain Dawson's Creek/more mature than their years way of speaking.  But, I loved their sarcasm and just their voices in general. {I'm actually a little surprised and impressed at how well John Green got into the head of a teenage girl.}Hazel, Augustus (and even Isaac) were believable even if how they said what they said was a little mature for them.  Plus, these aren't normal teens.  These are kids who have dealt with cancer and the threat of death for YEARS.  Honestly, I found Hazel and Augustus to have a more quirky feel to them than being too unbelievably mature for their age.  These teens, after years of treatments, losing friends to the disease that they themselves have, trying to stay strong for their families and friends ... have accepted their fates.  They have cancer.  Cancer SUCKS but their cancers don't define or limit who they are.  They still have life to live.  That's empowering and uplifting.One of the things that I liked was getting an inside view into the life of a teen with cancer.  Hazel was diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer at the age of 13.  Since then she knows that death is hovering over her but with the help of a miracle drug she has been able to lead a pretty normal life (even though she has to lug an oxygen tank around with her for when her lungs suck at being lungs).  Hazel knows she's living on borrowed time and she hates feeling like an emotional grenade so she tries as hard as possible to minimize the emotional shrapnel that she'll cause her friends and family when she finally dies.  Hazel is hunkering down for the inevitable ... until she meets Augustus.The one and only thing that I felt detracted from me giving this a full on 5 star review was the addition of the book storyline (a book that Hazel and Augustus are infatuated with).  It broke away from their relationship and, I feel, bogged down the storyline too. It may also stem from the fact that I just didn't 'get' the book.This is a book about the strength of the human spirit, the bravery and resilience of a bunch of teens who were dealt a really tough lot in life.  It shows the nastiness of cancer and the strength we gain from connecting with others.  It reminds us that we can still make a huge impact on the lives of our loved ones even if we may not be around long enough to make an impact on the world at large.Here's a quote from the book that sums up how I feel about this book:I fell in love the way you fall asleep.  Slowly.  Then all at once.Oh yes.  This book got to me slowly and totally captivated me before I knew what was coming.Highly recommended.My Rating: 4.5/5 stars"
5," picked up this book by chance at an airport, using my usual algorithm: reading the first sentence and deciding whether it was captivating enough to make me want to continue reading. Clearly, it was.There are many good things to be said about this book, but the one that mattered to me the most was its unshielded honesty. Sick people are not glorified, angelic fighters against their disease with family and friends faithfully by their side. Instead, they pee themselves and throw up, they bitch and moan and hurt their loved ones, they alternate between wishing they were healthy and wishing they were dead. Their friends abandon them and their families often can't offer more than empty, nauseatingly bland inspirational quotes. But through all of this they find each other, they grasp and understand each other, they grow to love each others' souls while their bodies are slowly decaying.And yes, as it has been mentioned by previous reviewers, they use a language so glorifying and grand that it borders on ridiculousness, and that seems completely unsuitable for 16-year old kids. For a moment I, too was sceptical about it. And them I remembered being 17 and in love for the first time, and how everything felt larger than life; and that was for me, who knew she would have many more of those romances yet to come. How much grandeur must lie in a love like this for a kid who knows it will be their last, their one and only??It is a book that made me burst out in laughter in the beginning, and grow more and more emotional and melancholic as the protagonist slowly drops her protective wall of cynical indifference and acknowledges her fears and wishes and fragility. But, most importantly, despite the deeply sad topic, the book remains surprisingly life-affirming, continuously reminding the reader why throughout all the pain and desperation life is so, so, so worth living."
5," can now officially say I know what all the fuss is about.  This book really was THAT GOOD.  When I go into reading a book with such high expectations I fear the worst will occur.  Happily I can say that did not happen with this one at all.  I loved it just as much as I was hoping I would.  No harm done with the excessive rave reviews... they were fully warranted.  :)Hazel has cancer.  She almost died a couple times, and can't seem to figure out why she's still alive, walking this earth, when the cancer should have taken over by now.  She needs breathing assistance on a regular basis, but the medication she's on seems to be keeping her tumors at bay, giving her more time.  She may be terminal, but she's still alive.Hazel reluctantly attends her first support group meeting.  There she meets several wonderful and entertaining characters, including Augustus Waters.  He's silly, fun, witty, sensitive, and is also suffering from cancer.  His is in remission, but he knows how she's feeling and seems to be the only one that's able to connect with Hazel and really get through to her.  As a result of this new relationship with Augustus, Hazel begins to live her life.Choosing the audio route for a popular book is sometimes not a good thing.  A bad narrator can really ruin even an amazing book.  But I have not a single complaint about Kate Rudd.  She performed this novel beautifully, from the joy and hope Hazel was feeling one minute, to the devastation and hopelessness she was overwhelmed with the next.Sad?  Yes.  You have to go into this story knowing that it's sad.  If you're looking for a sweet, happy upbeat story, this probably isn't the book you want to read at that moment.  This story involves the wonderful story of romance, love and learning to live life to the fullest.  Yes, all inspirational things, and the story really is that.  But it's centered around teenagers with cancer.  Sad.  This story is so realistic, so harsh and touching, I was completely enthralled right from the beginning.Seeing as how so many people have already read and gushed about this story excessively, I have a feeling I'm not the sole member of the I love TFioS fan club.  This is a powerful story that almost anyone will enjoy.  If you haven't read this book (Are there really people that haven't read this yet?  I thought I was the last one!) I suggest you do.  I challenge you to not be touched and inspired by this beautiful story."
5," prolonged reading this one. I knew it was going to be good - not only because of the rave reviews I'd been hearing, but also because the subject matter was a tough one to tackle. And yet, I let it sit in my TBR pile for three months, while I stalled and read other books.cancer touches many lives, and everyone deals with it differently. What I found amongst those pages, was an exceptional story - and while beautifully written, it was tremendously bittersweet. Anyone who has had even a glimpse into this devastating disease, can completely relate to how raw and heartbreaking this journey truly was.The relationship between Hazel and Augustus from start to finish, was nothing short of believable - full of emotion, yet flavored throughout with well-timed humor, as the two made their way through such unfortunate circumstances. Neither of them gave credit to their cancer - it simply was what it was, and they both dealt with the hand they were given, in the best way they knew how.You may have noticed (or not?) that I didn't capitalize the c in the word cancer, anywhere above - and that's because I don't believe it deserves that kind of credit or attention. One day we'll figure out how this horrible disease takes over the human body, metastasizes throughout, and ultimately, takes the ones we love. And we'll stop it. Until then, it's exceptional books like THE FAULT IN OUR STARS that makes you realize, it doesn't matter who you are or what your age is, in the end, cancer affects us all.John Green is a master at story-telling; a true artist in the way he delivered a journey that could have gone in a non-favorable direction, all too easily. A FAULT IN OUR STARS was an excellent read and a favorite YA contemporary for me - this is one I highly recommend to everyone."
5," One of the best books I've read in a while. This book was recommended to me by a co-worker who normally we don't share the same reading taste. We've passed recommendations back and forth and never do we ever agree on the same book. However, here is one where we both enjoyed it to the max.The first page is all you need. There is no set up and waiting for the story begin, it's like riding in a race car and the driver puts the pedal to the metal. Whoa!! And it basically kept that momentum the entire length of the book.I enjoyed both main characters Augustus and Hazel. I loved their growth through the book, individually and together. They were definitely a match made for each other. I loved the little quirks Augustus had and the way he treated Hazel and others in the support group.My favorite character in the support group was Isaac. I think my reason for saying this was because of his two major obstacles he faced in the book, as well as everyone thought of him as their little brother.My least favorite character was Van Houten. Well at least at the beginning of the book. By the end of the book I wasn't so hard on the man, probably because I understood him better. I think Augustus had figured him out as well.My largest contemplation in the book was the parents of both Hazel and Augustus. Learning of the ways they were dealing (or not) and how they were helping the patient to deal (or not), was very interesting to me. In the book Me Before You by JoJo Moyes, the parents of Patrick I also found interesting in their handling of their son's illness and his choices. I could see alot of similarities between the two books, so if you haven't read either one they are both excellent books!I highly recommend this book to all readers; young, old, male, female, healthy, ill, etc.. It is just a great book!!"
2," So, this is the only book that has ever made me laugh out loud in earnest, to the point where people asked me what was so damn funny, while simultaneously crying. Towards the end, I couldn't even bear to listen with anyone else in the room, because it was too personal, so I just lay in bed in the dark and let the tears roll.This is not a story I would have chosen if I'd known what it was really about, but I was lured in by the endless 5-star reviews and the fact that my library had it on Playaway. I didn't really have a choice. And from the first few minutes, I couldn't turn it off. Listened to all seven+ hours in one day. Kate Rudd didn't just read this book. She performed the entire beautiful thing like a one-woman play and I believed every single voice and knew who was speaking without being told and the life she breathed into the dialogue was better than I could have done in my head, which never happens in audiobooks. She was, in short, unforgettably amazing and if I could leave this review on Audible, I would. I will listen to anything she reads.I don't know why I've been avoiding John Green. Maybe because he was a man writing YA fiction? I'm clearly judgmental, because I didn't think a man could capture the real heart of a story in the same way a woman could. And I was wrooooooooooong. Hazel Grace was not a character, she was a person, and I met her and I loved her and I loved Augustus Waters and I loved their parents who were the first parents in any YA book I have ever freaking read who were real parents. Parents with feelings who loved their kids and were there without being overbearing or smothery or cliche. And guess what? There was opportunity for Augustus and Hazel to be together without either of their parents having a job that kept them out of the house 24 hours a day. It was miraculous.This story is not a feel-good HEA. It made me do the ugly cry, which I typically avoid because life is too short to go out of your way to feel heartbroken for imaginary people, but as Augustus's mom would say on a plaque, Without pain we would never know joy The bright spots of laughter and joy are worth the ugly cry. And unlike An Imperial Affliction, Hazel Grace's favorite book, the ending does not cut short in the middle of the thought. It ends exactly, perfectly, where it should and I am thankful to have experienced it."
5," Warning! Spoilers in comment! Don't read this if you haven't read the book.At first I didn't want to read this book because I knew that someone was going to die and someone was going to lose someone and etc. In fact, it took me about a month to even convince myself to buy it for my kindle, but I kept putting it off with other stories about how the girl gets the guy or how someone saves this magical land. Some fantasy that always had a happy beginning, middle, and end. I had been afraid to experience, once again, the curse of an attachment to someone with terminal disease such as cancer. In stories like these, someone always dies. And it's usually the healthy person. And it usually teaches us as regular human beings some universal lesson to love each other, keep promises, etc etc. John Green captured precisely all that ran through my mind around the time of my Aunts' deaths, one having died of bone cancer and the other of breast and stomach cancer. And the same when my Grandfather passed away less than a year ago. I don't know why we as humans always complain about dealing with pain as it is very unpleasant (for us and for those around us. No one wants to have to be the consoler or consolee), but yet we subject ourselves to it all the time through stories and the need to feel. When I began reading this book, it was hard because I would remember my aunt having the same mindset as Augustus, and I would remember the countless hours of trying to figure out life and death, which still proved to benefit me in no way as I was not and never will be prepared for death. I believe they are no longer feeling pain, so I'm happy, but I'm still feeling pain, so in a way my mourning is selfish. Anyway, I couldn't get through without crying and missing who I've lost and coming back around to realize, just like Hayley Grace, that we are grenades waiting to hurt someone, even without meaning to, so I don't want to die and be that grenade. I've always believed that life was made as a source of happiness for other people. You are something someone else loves, which is why I feel some people have such a hard time loving themselves, yet are so afraid to die. We are made to care about other people, and would rather not put grief upon others so why would dying be any different. Anyway, I read the book of course, as pain is only an obstacle and a benefit to the overall message and heartwarming tale that is this book. I would just like to say that John Green's mind is genius and understanding. There are few people who can claim to understand the misguided truths and fates of the living, but he does so with dignity and confidence AND for the world to see, which is why this, so far, is the best book I've ever read."
5," Sometimes, you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book. -John Green, The Fault in Our Stars  For the past ten years John Green, author of Printz Award Winner Looking for Alaska, among many others, had attempted to write a story regarding cancer after serving five months at a children's hospital as a chaplain after college. His experiences with unnecessary death have helped him pen one of the best, if not the best, examples of modern YA literature.  Sixteen year old Hazel Grace Lancaster has been diagnosed with lung cancer. Despite the tumor-shrinking miracle that has bought her some years, her time is running out. Hazel lives her life reading the same book, An Imperial Affliction by Peter van Houten, over and over again and feels that the author gets her and how she, a teen with cancer, feels. Hazel wants nothing more than to know what happens after the end of the book, where the novel ends mid-sentence, symbolizing the unpredictable nature of death. Hazel's mother takes her unusual behavior as a sign of depression and signs her up for a Cancer Kid Support Group at the local church, featuring a rotating cast of the terminally ill. It is here that she makes a friend of Isaac, a lover of video games with cancer in the remaining eye that fate has spared him. She also falls for charismatic, one-legged Augustus Waters, who, when he offers to give up his cancer Wish (think Make-a- Wish foundation) to see Peter van Houten, changes her life in way she would never have imagined.  Before reading the novel, the idea turned me off somewhat. As Hazel herself states, Cancer books suck. This is not a book about cancer. This is not a book about death - these elements serve primarily the drive the plot along, but it is the ingenious and intelligent characters and the relationships between them, primarily between Hazel and Gus, that make this book. TFiOS, like all of John Green's novels, is not dumbed down for teenagers. While Hazel and Augustus are most definitely adolescents, their dialogue gives away their deeper maturity. Despite their terminal illnesses, these incredibly likable characters do not behave in a way that reminds one of the fact.  The Fault in Our Stars is beautiful, funny, undeniably clever, and emotionally moving. To quote one of John Green's YouTube videos, it truly does make the reader feel all the things. TFiOS can likely drive a reader to laugh while crying, feel anger in the midst of pity, and feel joy in the presence of death. It is a miracle it could even be captured in words at all, thus making it nearly impossible to describe. If this book does not give a reader chills, they may very well not possess a soul."
5," This novel is freaking deep. Take away the fact we have teenagers faced with terminal illnesses, and it will still mess you up five different ways to Monday. I love that it's about life and yea, it's about kids freakin' dying, but it HAD TO BE. It's meant to be used as a way for us to evaluate our own lives and our own choices and our own way of living. It's meant to upset you. It's meant to disrupt the perfect day-to-day life you pretend to live, only to be screwed up by the petty not-so-day-to-day mishaps. It's meant to get you up out of your seat or bed or bean bag chair or, if you're anything like me, off the floor, and get doing and being who you are. The book had to be about teenagers! And you know why?? Because it wouldn't upset you as much. Something about a story robbing you of the rest of your life at a young age screws up EVERYONE. But that's the point. If you don't like it, then you don't get it. Go back and try again. Shall we discuss the ending? Nope, I'd rather not. John Green will not let you down. The ending has one very distinct meaning and if you don't get it, turn around, do the walk of shame back to your copy, and try it again.But when it comes to what I didn't like: Did I mention it had freakin' teenagers dying in it? It sucks and I bawled the whole last quarter of the book. In a way, it is pandering a bit. I mean, you're a jerk with a capital *D* if you hate a book about kids dying. It's a rule somewhere, I swear. But I already mentioned why it was necessary. Doesn't mean I have to like it. My only real criticism of the book comes from the the readers saying the teens don't act like real teens. I know 14 year old kids who read this and connected with the teenagers. I think most teenagers do sound like Hazel and Gus... internally... and until you're a high schooler faced with death every friggin' day, I really can't see how you would know what they should act like. Not to mention, I don't know about you, but I know a LOT of teenagers. Upwards of 2000. They're a lot more intelligent and thought-provoking than most adults remember. I just hate the double standard -- when a piece of work makes teenagers sound unintelligent, then we're not giving them something to look up too. But when a book comes along that might be a little above a teenager's head with a healthy outlook on life, people berate it for not being realistic enough. Shut up already and enjoy the message.Oh, there is one real complaint. Gus is a horrible name, John Green. I couldn't get Cinderella's chunky little mouse out of my head.I recommend this to everyone. Yes. To. Everyone. As soon as I finished it, I demanded other book-reading nerds to move it to the front of their current lists. I says to them, I said What are you reading? And before they could finish a sentence I said, No, stop it. Don't. As soon as you finish that book, which it better be good, give it to me to read and you start reading TFIOS. And then they'd give me some horrible excuse about putting it off for the summer or a trip or a time when they could handle it. To which I replied, with a firm slap on the desk or counter, Heck, no you won't. Read it. Curl up in the corner and cry and finish it! Most everyone has read it by now, but if you're still looking for a reason to do it --- DO IT."
5," Okay . . . so, here's the thing:Do you want characters you can believe in and like?Do you want a touching story that can make you laugh and cry?Do you want INCREDIBLE dialogue?Do you want a romance that is so wonderful and wonderfully sad all at once?Do you want a to read a book by a stellar author?Do you want all of that without ANY fantastical or magical elements? Yeah . . . well, I don't usually go for books that don't have this last one, but I am sooo happy I picked up The Fault in Our Stars.This book was very highly recommended by one of my editors. I have a lot of respect for her book choices so I decided to give it a try even though it is out of my normal fantasy choices. This book does not disappoint. I absolutely LOVE Augustus and Hazel's way of conversing, and there was a really refreshing and unique voice that John Green used in telling this bittersweet story.I finished up this book as I sat at my first con as a published author, quietly hunkered down behind my author table to read during every second I could steal (and, Mr. Green, I most likely could have sold more books if I had been concentrating on what I was there to do instead of reading your most excellent book. Just sayin'). An author across from me told me she couldn't believe I could read it in public without crying, how wonderful she thought it was, and, as a high school English teacher, how she wished she could teach this one. I had MANY young ladies stop and gush to me about how amazing the book was (yep, Mr. Green, I took full advantage of those moments to try to sell my own book to those young ladies).So, do I recommend this book? Without hesitation. Just be sure to have a box of tissue handy and, if you're old enough, a bottle of wine. I happen to be more than old enough.Go . . . buy it . . . read it . . . and, enjoy."
5," Let me begin by explaining this book has changed my entire philosophy on reading. I am not a reader - I have never been a reader. This is a fact that has caused great frustration to my family as they have tried to convince me to pick up books since I was a child with little success. I'm certainly capable of reading and even concentrated in English in college as I love writing and literary analysis, but something about actually reading a book has never appealed to me. That's not to say I haven't enjoyed reading some books, but I've just never quite understood why so many people can find them so profoundly life changing. And then I picked up The Fault in Our Stars.I picked up this book on a whim. I decided I had free time and so I may as well make an attempt to read something. The plot summary appealed to me and so I grabbed The Fault in Our Stars. I was pretty immediately hooked.Green's writing is positively exquisite. This is the type of book that SHOULD be placed in the hands of teens because he tells a story that they can relate to but does not dumb anything down for them. The language is rich, the characters are well-developed, and the reader will undoubtedly be enamored with them by the end; even at 24, I am.I noticed a number of people saying that this isn't realistic, that this is not how teenagers talk. With the exception of Kaitlyn (who Green describes as an extremely sophisticated twenty-five-year-old British socialite stuck inside a sixteen-year-old body - i.e. not meant to sound like a typical teen), I disagree. None of the characters ever felt fake to me and their way of speaking just made the already eccentric and unique characters more eccentric and unique, which was fitting. They are not meant to be the perfect depiction of teenagers; they are meant to be flawed (even Hazel and Augustus point out their hamartia). The language that's used by Augustus and Hazel is just another part of who they are.This book did, of course, make me cry - but not as much as some others that I've read and actually less than I anticipated. Certainly, The Fault in Our Stars is worth shedding more than a few tears for, but more than anything, it got me thinking. About life, about oblivion, about heartbreak, and in the choices we make (even when those choices hurt you). I think these thoughts are more important than the tears I shed and those I didn't shed. Still, Green is an absolute master at making you FEEL. There were times while reading this book that I was literally laughing out loud while crying and I don't know how anyone else could make the word okay turn into the most romantic word in the world.I'm already trying to choose which of Green's books to pick up next. Considering I've never been a reader and average maybe a book every six months, max, this is a major feat for me. The Fault in Our Stars made a reader out of me. It made me feel in the way that almost no books ever do. It made me fall in love with a fictional romance between two teenagers and want it to never end. It made me laugh, cry, and think.I truly believe this is a book worth reading and I highly recommend it to anyone who thinks they need the wisdom of an Augustus Waters and a Hazel Grace in their life."
5," Okay. So. Aside from The Fault In Our Stars, I have not read anything by John Green. I see what a dumb decision that was now. After reading this amazing work of literature, I feel like running to the bookstore (even though it's midnight here) and buying everything else he's ever written.I have this thing set up here on Goodreads called a '2012 Reading Challenge'. This year, I decided to try and read 60 books, because last year I read 55. Now, I really want to complete said challenge. It gives me a nice feeling of accomplishment. The reason I mention this is because, sometimes, when I read a book, I'm counting the pages till it's over so I can move onto the next one and be closer to fulfilling my goal.But sometimes, I find a book that I just don't want to end. I want it to go on forever and ever; screw the reading challenge. I'm just gonna sit here and read The Fault In Our Stars for the rest of 2012. This was how I felt after completing the novel.I cried on and off during the book. I also laughed. Sometimes I laughed while I was crying. It was weird. But anyway, I love it when I read something that touches me so deeply. In my opinion, if a book brings out strong emotions in you, it must be good on some level. The humor and the sadness are mixed together so well - I believe Marcus Zusak had it right when he said you laugh, you cry, and then you come back for more.The characters were quirky and they were fun. I adored Augustus and Hazel. And Isacc,too. Can't forget about him.All in all, even though it's still pretty early in the year, I have the distinct feeling that this book will be among my top five favorites of 2012. I can only hope that I find another book soon that lives up to the awesomeness of this one, because, at this very moment, I feel I may be underwhelmed by anything else.The Fault In Our Stars is a solid five star book."
5," Review by #minibabe at [...]The Fault in Our Stars is the newest book John Green has written and was the first one that I had read. It had been circulating through my high school like the plague and everybody was raving about how spectacular it was, so I thought I'd give it a go. In the beginning of the book you're introduced to Hazel, the protagonist of the novel, who sets the mood to the average teenaged mind set. Everything is boring as hell (yes, we do think this quite often). But there is something different about Hazel; she is sixteen years old and she has Thyroid cancer in her lungs. This basically means her lungs fail at being lungs and she has to carry an oxygen tank wherever she goes. Hazel's mother believes Hazel to be depressed since she spends %60 of her life laying in bed and doing nothing and the other %40 thinking about death. Her doctor agrees which results in her medication being adjusted and having to go to a cancer support group. During one of the cancer support group meetings she meets Augustus Waters, the incredibly good looking ex-basketball player and amputee. At first she doesn't want to pursue a relationship with him because she wants to hurt the least amount of people as possible with her inevitable death. Hazel eventually gives in and a beautiful love story unfolds.SPOILER ALERT: You are going to cry. A lot.I knew I was going to cry because everyone who read it told me they cried but I didn't expect to cry as much as I did. The worst part was I was currently 30,000 ft. in the air on an airplane sitting next a stranger when I started crying. Not fun. Anyways let's get back to the book, shall we?This book can be a life changer if you make it which honestly you should because the way that Hazel sees things is so different than anything I've seen. Her way of thinking is quirky at times and almost philosophical at others. One of the best things about this novel is that it gets you thinking about a lot of things. It gets you thinking about life, death, human nature, hope and love. My favorite kinds of novels are the ones that change the way I see the world and I can honestly say this one absolutely did.The writing style of this book is easy to follow and comical at many different points. Also I would like to applaud Mr. Green for this is the first book of his that is written in a girl's perspective and he nailed it.All in all, this book was a literary masterpiece in my opinion. I would definitely recommend to teens and adults as a must read. Any of John Greens books are a must read.I hope you enjoyed my very first book review and don't forget to be awesome."
5," was skeptical about reading this novel, because generally I find it hard to relate to 'teenager' books. Firstly, this is not a 'teen' book, although it is good for teenagers/young adults to read as well. I decided to read it because I loved the title. It is inspired by Shakespeare's words in Julius-Cesar (acknowledged by the author),The fault, dear Brutus is not in our stars, but in ourselves. It is a beautifully written story of a seventeen year old girl Hazel, battling cancer.  The strength of this novel lies not only in the author's capability of instilling life into his characters, but also creating happiness despite the pathos that underlies the plot. As an oncologist, I also applaud John Green's deep understanding of the many levels of pain that cancer brings, and the different kinds of strength we surprisingly find in its victims. This book made me laugh, made me cry, kept me awake. It was light and easy to read while being deeply philosophical about life, death and love.My favorite quotes are:About love,As he read, I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly and then all at once.About cancer:My dad understood my cancer the way I did: in the vague and incomplete way people understand electrical circuits and ocean tides. But my mom knew more about differentiated thyroid carcinoma in adolescents than most oncologists.(Edited to avoid spoilers)Some war. What am I at war with? My cancer. And what is my cancer? My cancer is me....It is a civil war..with a predetermined winner.Even cancer isn't a bad guy, really. Cancer is just trying to stay alive.About loss,Grief doesn't change you. It reveals you.The acclaim this book has won is well-deserved."
5," found this book so emotional that it took me a good week to pick up another book which is very unlike me, and it's taken me 2 weeks to feel ready to actually put some thoughts about it in writing.  I tossed up whether to read this book so many times last year when it came out as I saw nothing but stellar reviews constantly throughout 2012, but the topic of cancer is such a personal one for me having lost my mum to cancer at the end of 2010 that I wasn't sure if I could really handle it.  When I saw that Penguin Australia had it up in Netgalley for review I decided that I would take the plunge and give it ago and what a wonderful, albeit difficult read it ended up being.What I loved most about this book was how multi faceted it was while at the same time really being very simple.  The meat and bones of this book is most definitely a romance between 2 teens, though there are all these wonderful layers that are just subtlety woven in about death and dying, parenting and families, the realities of illness, how reading can affect one so personally - the list just goes on.  Most likely because I am a mother and I am also pregnant and hormonal I found some of the scenes Hazel has with her mum really hard to read.  There was one part where Hazel is describing when she was so very close to dying at 14, where her parents are there waiting to say goodbye and she overhears her parents talking and her mother starts crying saying she wasn't a mother anymore. This had me in a pool of tears in moments, and that to me is how to sum up the very essence of this book - so many beautiful simple moments that are just so emotionally driven, reading it was honestly exhausting!The characters of Hazel and Augustus are both lovely and while I felt that the banter between the 2 of them was perhaps a little too adult or perhaps a bit staged and melodramatic it still worked as these aren't your run of the mill teenagers with long lives ahead of them. I was impressed with the way the author managed to pull of a female protagonist she was well done, not over the top and really incredibly strong considering all she had faced in her short life so far.For all that this is a pretty depressing topic it is handled really well without glossing over the ugliness of illness.  I read this over 2 nights and found it difficult to put down or stop thinking about.  While this isn't a book I would recommend to everyone - too many of my friends are young mums and I don't think this is really a middle of the night feeding type book, I do think that if you are after something that will make you laugh, cry, smile and most importantly think that this is a fantastic book to read."
2," forgot how I came to know this book- maybe it was suggested from a friend of mine or maybe I found it in the internet but it doesn't matter anymore because to whoever that gave me the idea to buy this book, I can really say thank you!  Thank you for letting me meet Hazel and Augustus' tragic love story in Indianopolis. Thank you for bringing me into the world of Cancer Support Group.  This book, with a colorful cover and a sad title is ironic.( You won't know where the title is from until you'll read the book and I have no plans of telling you. :D)  It is devasting, heart-breaking, tear-jerking yet funny at the same time..  Hazel Grace, a cancer survivor, or a cancer-bearing but tumor-shranked or whatever you call her,  shows the courage of a girl that doesn't have cancer even when she's connected to an oxygen tank for more than 2 years of her life. She's a strong girl that holds tears and she's witty and intelligent. AND she doesn't believe in the afterlife and the supreme God.  Augustus Waters, a physically strong man with his one leg natural and the other one prosthetic but a holding-back-cancer one. He is the most capable man in their trio, with Hazel and his bestfriend Isaac, who is blind due to cancer, too.  AND Augustus is funny and he believes in the afterlife and God.  ( The main narrator in the book is Hazel. Everything was her point of view so we don't know what's happening in Augustus' life unless Augustus will tell her or they are together. )  The way they were connected by one special book, Hazel introduced to Augustus, is cute.  The way John Green wrote this book as if he was in the part of a cancer patient was acceptable, with all the facts in it. And i like the part where he makes up names for medicines. We, the readers in turn would really feel the pain, the madness, the hopes, the hopelessness, the struggles, and even the gasping for air or throwing up that the characters are feeling. I give him 5 stars for that!  What I also love about this book is that you can get many lessons from it and quotes.  It shows us how the characters inspite of their illness can throw back to each other jokes about thier illness. This shows us positivy. EXELSIOR! This is what makes the book funny.  It shows us how to feel when someone we love is die-ng or dying. It pains me a lot. I cried.  Or I think show us how to feel when we are on their shoes---How to feel like you're dying and you can't do anything about it. I cried.  While reading the book, I asked myself because I was afraid.-   What if that happens to me?  What if I'm dying?  Will someone cry?  Will someone say to me something before i die?  Do i have lots of friends?  Have i lived my life how it's supposed to be?   Overall, the book will (be warned:) break your heart. Read this book. I highly recommend this to you!  PS. BEWARE OF VAN HOUTEN!  My rating: 5 STARS!"
5," When we think about true love we think of two middle aged people meeting in the perfect place, get married on the perfect date, have perfect children, and living happily ever after.  Sometimes love doesn't work out that way.  Sometimes love happens between two people who do not know the full meaning of love yet.  Two people who do not expect to love and get it back; at least for the time being.  It's funny how one single unfortunate, hurtful event and life experience can bring two different people together and spark a relationship that is beyond true love.  John Green captures this reality perfectly in The Fault in our Stars. The story is about a girl named Hazel Graze Lancaster, 16, who has stage 4 thyroid cancer, and Augustus Waters, 17, who has Osteosarcoma.  They meet in a group session one day and their relationship escalates from there on out.  They both fall in love with each other and never leave each other's side. When that day comes (in the end of the novel) when life seems to shatter for Hazel, she comes to the reality that she is going to be living with cancer.  She realizes that she is happy with what she has done in her life, and would never do anything different. Cancer is an important issue in this world today.  We see people becoming diagnosed with the hundreds of different types, and most not making it out alive.  We mourn for those souls.  The patients however, look at life a totally different way, and John Green captures these realities and issues just perfectly.  Living with the cancer is just one upon dozens of the realities these cancer patients face.  Hazel never takes for granted anything in her life and always thanks her parents for what they have done.  She accepts the fact that someday she will die, even if it is sooner rather than later.  She is humble and becomes even more humble through all that she witnesses and experiences.  What we witness is a completely different side of it, and wanting to help these kids while reading the book, is not something uncommon. John Green is a fabulous writer who captures the reality and important, standing issues of cancer in our lives.  The Fault in our Stars is a perfectly written, well portrayed viewpoint on life with cancer.  Through two young peoples' struggles, the unfortunate reality of cancer brings them together.  We start to see actual, true love, come out of this book and it is an absolute page turner.  You will connect with the characters, feel their pain, and you will definitely be left on your toes wanting one last look at the fault in their stars."
5," Being the die-hard nerdfighter that I am, I watched John write the book (and sign more pieces of paper than I ever thought possible).  Needless to say, I opened the book with overly high expectations... that were more than met.  First and foremost, The Fault in our Stars is about teenagers living with cancer, but is not a cancer book (because cancer books suck).  Instead, its about enjoying life while it lasts.  John easily could have written a self-disparaging book about how life could end at any point in time and what is the point of goals (ok, being John Green and made fully of awesome, I doubt that), but instead its easy to forget that they have terminal cancer and have an expiration date on their lives.Like all of John's books, when you leave Hazel and Augustus's world, it is incredibly hard to return to yours.  The characters grow and develop and are so personal that you feel as if you are leaving your best friend when its dinner time and you have to go eat.  Going into The Fault in our Stars, you know that you are going to cry, but don't realize why.  Instead of breaking down when expected (although I did that too), for me at least, it was a constant eyes-filling-but-never-falling-over type mode.  Quick disclaimer: this is not a sad book.  It is witty, quick, funny, full of life, fantastic, wonderful, and all things positive.  No, I cried because you are just sitting there watching your best friend suffer as everyone else has given up on her and can't do anything about it.  They are the strongest person you know and the bravest.  And all you can do is help them live the remainder of their life to the fullest and try to not miss a moment.I could gush on for another thirty minutes or so, but there are another 3,000 reviews of other people doing that.  I could write a book synopsis, but that's in the book description.  The moral of this story is that I just have a need to share my love with the world and this is how it is happening.  On that note, enjoy, come fangirl with me, and DFTBA."
5,"t's a rare thing to finish reading a book and to feel like you should thank the author. I've felt this several times with Terry Pratchett, on a few occasions with Neil Gaiman, and once or twice with others. I got to feel that and other emotions today, upon finishing John Green's The Fault In Our Stars.Now, let me be perfectly clear: this is a sad book. It is about two kids with cancer who fall in love, and as they are teenagers and as they have cancer, it is unlikely to resolve with a miracle cure and everyone hugging at the end with bones unriddled with a disease made up of them.Death is ever present in the book, but it avoids nihilism. The sadness can only come from people not giving in, because of course there can be no real sadness if one just lays down and dies. Forfeiting life is forfeiting emotion, and this too is a huge part of the book.Hazel Grace, our protagonist with her cannula O2 tank at the ready, is possessed by a burden whose weight does not drag down, but shoves forward. The descent of her life towards its inevitable end is, though somehow not hastened, given momentum by the press of all persons who have come before her. By her own assertion, to be dead is to no longer have the option of life and all the experiences, good and bad, that living entails. As such, Hazel Grace knows she must continue to live for as long as she can, and live as much as she can, as a sign of respect to the billions of dead who cannot.If should feel a power outside yourself compelling you, to have it shove you in one direction or another, it is always best to choose a power that pushes forward rather than back or down or sideways. Hazel Grace finds living overwhelming, but does so anyway because the alternative is not only undesirable to the individual, but disrespectful to all those who don't have the free choice to go back and forth between the states of living and nonliving.In short, amazing book, short but perfect in its shortness because - like Portal - it gets its point across and then leaves you to do your thinking thing. If you can take the sadness - I point that out because the romance is amazingly not retch inducing in the slightest - read this. And if you can't take the sadness, then maybe you should read it anyway, because that is sort of the point, isn't it?"
5," The Fault in Our Stars...three days after closing the book. My greatest regret at this moment is that it took me so long to read it. I have had it sitting on my shelf for nearly a year. I had to steel myself to read it because I knew it was a kids with cancer book. No, I knew it was a KIDS WHO DIE OF CANCER book. I have a kid, and I know kids with cancer. See my problem? Days ago I forced myself to read the first two chapters. I was OK. The next night? I fell in love with the main characters, Hazel and Augustus. These were NOT kids dying of cancer. These were kids trying to squeeze every minute of life they had remaining out of their early termination notice. These kids were REAL. They were funny, angry, realistic, day-dreaming, pain-in-the-you-know-where teens LIVING in that flash in the pan moment between birth and death. I read everything but the last 100 pages. When you read it, you'll know why...and you really should read it. Again, I had to rally my forces. The last 100 pages? I cried an ocean. Not because John Green was yanking my chain or because I cry over puppy chow commercials (okay, sometimes), but again because these voices were real, and heartbreaking, and somehow amazingly hopeful. That book is now sitting on my shelf waiting on my 10-year-old to read it in a few years, when she and I are ready to share it and cry another ocean. This is YA literature at its best as far as I am concerned. I am a lifetime member of the John Green fan club even if he never writes another thing except cereal box ingredients. *News Flash: Today, our literacy coach called me on the phone to tell me one of her students just finished reading TFIOS, walked up to her and said, I think I need to go somewhere and take a minute. You too will need a minute...or hours or days...to recover. Get those Kleenex out. You have been warned!"
5," Steph's Review:Words cannot describe how much I loved this book. I have never cried so much in a long time, and nothing is even close to how heart-wrenching this book is. It is just Flat. Out. Amazing. As my friend Angie would describe it, it was just...beautiful. This book is a lot different from books I usually read, probably because of it's realism. Cancer exists, and right now we can't do anything to stop it. The Fault In Our Stars is very touching, and within the span of it's pages, John Green was able to fully connect his characters and world to me as if they'd been there my entire life. I actually wasn't expecting this to be as good as it was, but I listened to the awards and raves it got and gave it a shot. I had no regrets that I started read this from the very first chapter.At just 13 years old, Hazel Grace was diagnosed with thyroid cancer which metastasized to her lungs. By some miracle, a cancer-treating drug perceived to ineffective became her savior, and halted the growth of any new tumors in her body. However, Hazel is and will be tethered to an oxygen tank for the rest of her life, because her lungs simply won't be good lungs anymore. She's practically given up. It's not exactly a good situation, because anything normal for kids her age is now out of her reach, or so she believes.During a fateful meeting at the Cancer Support Group, Augustus Waters barrels into her life. He's hot, one legged, funny, and hopeful. Cancer-free and in remission, Augustus Waters is what cancer patients hope to be one day. With his sweet talk, he gets right into Hazel's nerves and shows her that living with cancer doesn't take away who you are. You just have to make the time meant for you your own infinite, your type of forever.John Green, amazingly, was able to put so much humor into this book despite it's serious topic. I don't even know how many times I LOL'd while I was reading it, and contrary to my personal belief, he can write romance. Augustus is such a sweetheart, and he's pretty darn arrogant and hilarious. I love him, enough said. He's a bright highlight, both to Hazel and to The Fault itself. Despite his near flippant attitude, he is one of the wisest characters in the book, and provided more support to Hazel than her parents ever could. Hazel's first mindset is that she's just an ugly nobody, waiting to rot in a grave, but Augustus makes her feel and become someone beautiful. John Green, through this book, tells everyone that there isn't anything wrong with hope, and it's one of the strongest feelings a person can have.Back to the crying part. While this book was happy-go-lucky for the first 2/3, a surprising twist made my whole world come crashing down like a meteor plummeting towards Earth. I was kind of expecting it to happen, but it was still surprising nonetheless because I didn't want it to happen, I was hoping it wouldn't. The ending of The Fault was as heartbreaking as it was heartfelt. There are so many life messages hidden between the pages that inspire you to be better. It was pretty bittersweet, but still hard to handle. I read too much paranormal stuff, when there is always a HEA. I cried at least three times within the last 100 pages, no joke. I could not get over this book for days, and me and Angie (mentioned above) blubbered over this book for a while. A long while. I once had to write an essay for school on the book that most changed my life and I chose to write it on Kira-Kira by Cynthia Kodohata. If I had to rewrite that essay today, The Fault In Our Stars would have been my top choice instead. This is definitely a must read for adults and teens both.--Steph @ A Walk on Words"
5," There's basically no way to tell people what The Fault In Our Stars is about without it sounding like the worst book ever written. A YA novel about a young girl with terminal cancer who falls in love with a cancer survivor she meets in a support group? That sounds like the kind of treacly pap you might expect from Lifetime or Nicolas Sparks, not a critically acclaimed bestseller from John Green, a widely beloved YA author. And yet, ask anyone who's read it, and they'll tell you that this isn't sentimental, manipulative garbage; this is thoughtful, moving, compelling stuff. And now that I've read it, you can add me to that chorus; The Fault In Our Stars is one of the finest YA books I've ever read, and just a magnificent book, period. But how on Earth does Green avoid this turning into the book we all dread it could be? Much of that has to be chalked up to his main character/narrator Hazel, whose voice is equal parts world-weariness, cynical humor, acceptance of death, quick wit, word lover, and pure teenage girl. Hazel's a wonderful creation, and she's far from the angelic, lesson-conveying manic pixie dream girl that inhabits so many Nicholas Sparks books; instead, she's a rich and wonderful person who has her own issues, her own dreams, her own goals, and her own inimitable voice. The same goes pretty much across the board; there's not a character that even dips their toes into the sea of cliche - these are all rich, complicated characters who come to life thanks to Green's rich prose. And as if great characters and excellent prose aren't enough, The Fault In Our Stars is genuinely, profoundly moving and affecting. It dodges easy, pat answers about death and mortality, avoids the easy routes at all times, and dodges cheap sentimentality; and still, for all that, when it wants to hit you hard, it's going to, plain and simple. Part beautiful coming-of-age story, part teen romance, part meditation on mortality, part hilariously funny dialogue work, The Fault In Our Stars deserves every bit of acclaim it's gotten and then some. It made me laugh, it made me think, and yes, it made me cry, cliched though that sentence sounds. It's a magnificent book, and I'm better off for having read it."
5," This and more reviews available at [...]At one point I had to pause and wanted to hide my book in the linen closet.  I knew what was going to happen next.  John Green novels don't let on that things are going to end with the lovely couple running through a field of posies, into the sunset.  If you've read Looking for Alaska, you know what you're in for; the emotional roller coaster of life and death... reality. We all know our existence will be extinguished, however, the majority of us don't know how, unless, you have some kind of kick-ass fortuneteller.  Still, is it something you want to know?  How your life is going to end.  The Fault in Our Stars (or TFIOS as the kids are calling it) faces this unknown, final chapter head on.  Hard enough for adults, John Green's novel depicts a teen's perspective in facing terminal illness.  The illness however takes a backseat to the living.  How does one live the life they are dealt, even if it sucks?Great One-liners/Quotes:I'm in love with you, and I'm not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things. I'm in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, and I am in love with you.Augustus WatersAfter I finished, there was quite a long period of silence as I watched a smile spread all the way across Augustus's face - not the little crooked smile of the boy trying to be sexy while he stared at me, but this real smile, too big for his face. Goddamn, Augustus said quietly.  Aren't you something else.Hazel Grace Lancaster (really Gus)After it was over, Peter Van Houten looked at us expectantly, his little eyes as wide as they could get.  Yeah? he asked.  Yeah?Peter Van HoutenI said, I'm sorry, sir, but we don't speak Swedish.Well, of course you don't.  Neither do I.  Who the hell speaks Swedish?  The important thing is not whatever nonsense the voices are saying, but what the voices are feeling.  Surely you know that there are only two emotions, love and fear..."
5," Disclaimer: This review may contain a few spoilers. The biggest spoiler is acknowledged as SPOILER ALERT.Hazel is a sixteen year old girl who has terminal cancer. Even though she is sick, and has to walk around with an oxygen tank, she doesn't let the cancer define her. Since she was homeschooled, Hazel has already taken, and passed, the GED and is enrolled in college literature classes. Hazel's favorite book is An Imperial Affliction, by Peter Van Houten, and loves to read poetry, but not write it.Lacking a social life, besides attending college classes, Hazel's parents urge her to go to a cancer support group held at a local church. At the support group, she meets Augustus, former high school basketball player whose cancer is in remission. Gus, as he is so often called, is attending a meeting with his friend, Isaac, who is about to have eye surgery, which will result in blindness.Hazel and Augustus form a bond that can only be found within a true friendship. They read each other's favorite books, play video games together, and speak to each other in metaphors. Although Hazel has more than friendship feelings for Gus, she is scared to get close to him because she doesn't want to hurt him with her illness. Gus, on the other hand, has been hurt before and is willing to take the risk because he cares so deeply about Hazel. Together, they laugh, cry, and fill each other's lives with companionship.The Fault in Our Stars by John Green is devastatingly beautiful. Even though cancer is as far from a funny subject as it can get, John Green makes it seem as if it's just another fact of life, and makes jokes that don't seem awkward or insensitive. The true love and friendship found within the characters of this novel are a rare find. I have read many fictional books about cancer, but this one is different, this one is special. Cancer is scary: for those who have it, had it, or watched someone struggle through it. John Green paints a real picture, he doesn't sugar-coat it. Not only was he able to create such an exceptional story-line for Hazel and Augustus, he was also able to put a story within a story by incorporating An Imperial Affliction, by Peter Van Houten, into so many aspects of this book.An Imperial Affliction, Hazel's favorite book, is not a real book; I know this because I googled it. In the made-up novel, Anna, the main character, is diagnosed with a rare blood disease. Her mother meets a Dutch man who says that he can help Anna with a special cancer treatment. Not only does he promise to help Anna, but her mother also falls in love with him. The novel ends in the middle of the sentence, leaving the reader (especially Hazel) angry and confused.Hazel considers Peter Van Houten one of her best friends, even though they have never met, because she thinks he knows what death is like, even though he hasn't died yet. I love how Hazel is so invested in this story and its characters.  I also love that Augustus begins to share her passion for the story and together they try to find out what happens to Anna's mother, the man her mother loves, and Anna's hamster. I'm not going to lie, I am kind of disappointed that I can't read this novel, it sounds so inspirational.SPOILER ALERT: My favorite part of  The Fault in Our Stars is when Hazel and Gus go to Amsterdam together, with the use of his wish,  to meet Peter Van Houten, but I hate that he is a rude, old man. I love that they go on a date and drink champagne and are able to experience young love the way it's meant to be experienced. I also love that they visit the Anne Frank House, a place on my bucket list, where they share their first kiss.Just as Hazel was upset with the ending of the An Imperial Affliction, I was also upset with the ending of The Fault in Our Stars. I don't know what it is with me lately, but books have been pissing me off when they end. Just like Hazel, I want more. I was also (and still am) upset about the ending of The Diary of Anne Frank (yes, I knew she was going to die, but I didn't know it was going to just END.) But, as I have come to learn, if a book leaves you wanting more, then the author must have done a good job (except in Anne Frank's case, it just wasn't her fault, and I'm sure she wishes she could have given us more.) John Green did better than good when he wrote The Fault in Our Stars, he did great."
5," The Fault in Our Stars is, without a doubt, now one of my most favorite books. It's told from the perspective of a snarky, sarcastic girl who loves to make self-deprecating jokes about the fact that she has cancer. Her personality is awesome... I totally wish that I could be her. Then she meets this gorgeous guy at a support group who is in remission, and they become really good friends and bond over their mutual love of novels and hilariously inappropriate humor.I was very surprised about where the book went from there. The quirkiness of the characters' personalities was maintained throughout the book, but there were parts that I read with tears streaming down my face, literally sobbing. While I'm definitely a cryer in real life and while watching movies or TV (and, embarrassingly, occasionally commercials), I can probably count on one hand the number of times that I've cried while reading a book. For some reason, it just barely ever happens with me. And it's never happened like this before. I mean, I was crying. The book was sad at points, but mostly I think that it just really resonated with me.I loved the main character and was able to feel a big connection with her throughout the book. Like her, I also love novels, am an only child, and love sarcasm. I also know what it is like to have a long-lasting condition that is a huge part of your life. When she was describing how it's like to constantly be in pain... I felt like I was listening to myself.The only thing that I could slightly criticize about this book was it's Perks of Being a Wallflower-itis. In that, the teenage characters in this novel were way more mature, smart, and witty than teenagers normally are in real life. While Perks of Being a Wallflower has no excuse (even though I still think it's an awesome book), I could almost kind of forgive John Green on this one. Maybe the characters were more mature because of their cancertastic-ness? Either way, I don't think that it took away from the book.I highly recommend reading this book. Five out of five stars, for sure."
2," Yeah sure, this is a cancer book, but, it's not about cancer. It's about strength and fun and books. It's about how a novel can transform you and sometimes amazing books are written by terrible people (looking at you OSC). It's about a girl named Hazel and a boy named Augustus and all the people that care about them. It's about blind and one-legged teens egging a car. It's about finding happiness where you can. It's about moving on. It's about making this day your best day.My thoughts are stars I can't fathom into constellations. That's a pretty good review for this book right there...Seriously though, this was such a great book. So many lines that just kick you right in the gut. It's surprising  because this book is really funny too. So you'll be reading along, chuckling at the banter between the characters and then all of a sudden BAM! This s*** just got serious. It totally works though, because that's how lots of people deal with hard things. They wrap it up into something funny and more manageable.Hazel was a great character. She just felt so real and honest. I loved how she was addicted to a novel. I've never been that obsessed with one novel before (yet) and it just seems amazing and wonderful. The only problem is this novel is fictional and now I want to read it and I can't. Fairly disappointing  but I guess less disappointing than if I read it and it was awful. Back to Hazel though, it was great having her be our main eyes and ears and brain for this story. She was a really honest narrator and she picked some pretty great people to hang around with. She acted real with her parents too. Not all I hate you! or We're BFFs for LIFE! but a nice mix in-between. It was easy to like Hazel, because she was nice person all around.I feel like this review needs to mention how amazing Isaac is. The Fault in Our Stars is always talked about HAZELANDAUGUSTUS!!!! which is fine, but ISAAC too. He lost his eyes to cancer and he was worried about his love life. He was just a really great character too and I wished he was in the novel a bit more. He really changed the outlook of the novel. He was so spirited that it didn't make his situation seem utterly depressing. I mean it still completely sucks having eye cancer I imagine, but he made himself into a person that could get past that and live life. Although, I have no idea what was going on with him internally this whole time, maybe he was miserable...secretly.Now Augustus. For how much charm he seemed to exuded, he also seemed incredibly awkward. He definitely tried way too hard a lot of the time. I have to agree with Hazel, that when he let all that slide away he was a much more awesome person. He was much more love-able without all that stuffy charm.The last few sentences of this novel were a bit flat. I felt like there should have been something more EPIC. But, life is a bit flat I guess.The last third of this book had me flailing my arms around much like a giant squid of anger. Life is so unfair. I know nobody ever said it was fair and it's childish(hopeful) to think that it is, but still. I mean WHY!? It just so awful that good people have to suffer while there are terrible, terrible people out there who get to live happy lives doing all their terrible things. They should be the one-eyed, one-legged, oxygen bearers of this world, not teens who are good people.It's not fair, I said. It's just so goddamned unfair.The world, he said, is not a wish granting factory,So yes, please read this book. When you get to the end throw this book. Smash this book, tear the pages from this book to wipe your face with. Afterwards buy a new book and place it on your shelf for next time.First Line:Late in the winter of my seventeenth year, my mother decided I was depressed, presumably because I rarely left the house and spent quite a lot of time in bed, read the same book over and over, ate infrequently, and devoted quite a bit of my abundant free time to thinking about death.Favorite Lines:His every syllable flirted.In the end, we both lost. So it goes.Augustus and I were together in the Improbably Creatures Club: us and the duck-billed platypuses.It seemed like forever ago, like we'd had this brief but still infinite forever.I owed a debt to the universe that only my attention could repay, and also that I owed a debt to everybody who didn't get to be a person anymore and everyone who hadn't gotten to be a person yet."
5," actually had a rough time with this book: not reading it, but choosing to, since this is my 100th book review (yay!), and I knew it has to be something very special. I actually read one of the John Green's Other books, Looking for Alaska, and I actually could form a resemblance between the two books. 1. There is a main character 2. He/she meets a friend 3. He/she gets a new, hopeful life 4. The friend dies 5. Massive shock period 6. RecoverNot all the book might follow this trend, but I think it is fine if they do, since it teaches us of loss and grief, and the recovery, and friendships. And hey? Without pain, how could we enjoy?This book features a girl with a serious lung cancer that would have taken her life away by filling her chests with fluids, but miraculously lives, and now stays in support of an oxygen tank. She missed 3 years of her teenage life by cancer, and now gets private (?) educations. However one day, she meets a boy in a support group, who changes her life.It is the classic love story, romance through the times of despair, and it actually has one of those aww[...] moments where, as they still know that one of them could die by cancer, forms a strong bond between each other to the point of nearly inseparable.The book themes around the two lovers, but also around this book, An imperial affliction (not a real book), which features as the girl's favorite book. It talks about a girl with a cancer, who ends up dying, and in the course of her story, talks about life, death, cancer, and family.If you read Looking for Alaska, then you defiantly should read this: it is fun, romantic, and exciting. It might give us the perspective of cancer, and how hard it will be to be in a 24 hour battle every day with your own body.I enjoyed reading it, and although it might not go into the aftermaths as serious as  Looking for Alaska, but it is still great, and the story finishes off clean, like most of the readers will like. 5 stars!"
5,"f you are ready to go on a rollercoaster of emotions were you often like to laugh, shed a tear or two and feel in love, why not experience all; The Fault In Our Stars is the best rollercoaster you can be on.In the book The Fault In Our Stars, Hazel who is a sixteen years old has terminal cancer and lives her life as a side effect until Augustus, her new social group friend, comes to change her way of life a little. Hazel, as she first starts to experience love, doesn't want to be a grenade to Augustus and her parents because she thinks she knows she is going to die and leave them all with a broken heart. But of course love is not a manageable thing when we are talking about a young gentleman and parents who really care.The author John Green does an excellent job at conveying an emotional tone where you are transported into amazing experiences. This is because there are often the times were the book is funny, romantic and tragic. As John Green says, Books belong to their readers, for me the theme was that things happen unjustly but it is up to you to turn the bad luck around and make your life worth living, this is even part of the quote used for the title of the book: The fault in our stars by Julius Caesar, were (even though it said that the fault is not in our stars but in ourselves) it is slightly incorrect because cancer for Hazel and Augustus was not their choice, it was not their fault.The plot of this story is very interesting and full of plot twists. It was not predictable for the same reason that whatever you think may happen does not end up happening, which enables this book to be majorly emotional. In one of the scenes Hazel wants to meet the author of An Imperial Affliction, her favorite book, and Peter (the author) comes out to being totally unpredictable.The character Hazel Grace is a very unique and complex character. In the book Hazel can be very fun and loose, but at the same time she knows when to be a serious person and an understandable person as well. She is unique because she is a very interesting person when getting to know her. At first you think she is just girl that feels sorry for herself because she has cancer, but she acts like a normal teen. She is finding love, and most people with cancer would not want to be with someone with cancer in fear of being hurt in the end.Augustus Waters is a very unique and relatable person. He is a relatable person because he cares for his friends like I do. He treats them like they are family, like I do with my friends. He is very understanding and he listens to friends when they are in need like if they are sad, or angry with someone. He is unique because he has one leg and acts like it is nothing, and he knows when to stop joking around and to get serious. He knows how to make someone feel better when the are having problems, and he cares for their problems before he starts to care for his own problems.Throughout the novel, dialogue is widely used. It helps the reader understand the character's thoughts of themselves and of each other. Even though there is a lot of dialogue being used, the author is still able to tell the story in an interesting way. He does use some figurative language but he keeps it at a minimum.I never really paid attention towards what cancer people go through. This book made me feel emotional. This book teaches many things and one of them is to value my life even if i face any health problems. It will take you to experiences you will never imagine.."
5," The Fault In Our Stars is written by John Green and was published only a year ago. This book is about a sixteen year old girl, Hazel Lancaster, who has had stage four thyroid cancer since age thirteen. All she really wants to do is be a regular teenager but she knows she can never be. She has to use an oxygen tank at all times to be able to breathe properly. She is forced by her mom to go to Support Group at the local church where many other kids also attend that have cancer. While there, she meets Augustus Waters, a former basketball star who lost his right leg to Osteosarcoma, and is in remission. Hazel and Augustus spend more and more time together and she convinces him to read her favorite book, An Imperial Affliction. He almost loves the book as much as she does. When their relationship deepens even more, complications with Hazel's cancer get worse and they start to feel they're drifting apart. Luckily, Augustus saved his wish from The Genies (a fictionalized version of The Make A Wish Foundation), and used the wish to take Hazel and himself to Amsterdam to meet the author of An Imperial Affliction, Peter Van Houten. The trip gets postponed when Hazel gets a serious case of pneumonia. She goes through a quick recovery and then they are on their way to Amsterdam! Once they get there, they are treated to a beautiful meal, courtesy of Van Houten. But, they soon find out that Van Houten is rude and an alcoholic. He wont answer any of their questions and is very disrespectful towards them.  They realize people are not all they seem to be. They spend one more day in Amsterdam and head home. When they get back, Augustus reveals his cancer has returned. From that point on, he starts heading in a downward spiral. Hazel and Augustus know what it's like to have cancer but all they can do now is just be there for each other.  I think this book is absolutely amazing. It's a true love story of two teenagers that have been through more in their life than most people could ever imagine. I just can't comprehend what it would be like to go three years with cancer and try to be a normal teenager and actually succeed at it. Teenagers already have enough stress with high school, responsibilities, drama, and just trying to be the best you can be. When you add cancer to that mix, you would think one would just simply break down. But Hazel stays strong and that's what I like about her. This book is beautifully written and is for all you readers out there that like to laugh and cry at the same time!"
5,"f I could give this book more than 5 stars I totally would. Holy hell it was fabulous. So amazing in fact that I almost became enraged at my grandmother for interupting my reading so I could get her some much needed groceries. I did not want to put it down, I read it in 1 day. Spoiler alert, this book will make you have emotions. You will care for these characters more than any others you've read in a long long time. And you will cry, if you don't it's possible you have no soul. I sobbed/bawled my way through the last 50 pages. My eyes were on fire (thanks mascara), my hair was soggy, and I'm pretty sure I was the epitome of beauty (not!). This book made me FEEL and I haven't had a book do that in a while. I literally cannot stop thinking about this book, it's just too good.I will attempt to decribe this book without giving too much away or making it sound depressing. The story follows Hazel, a sixteen year old girl with terminal cancer. Her best friends are her parents and she hasrelaxed into a routine that involves not doing much of anything. Her parents desperate to get her out of the house make her go to a cancer support group for kids and it is there that she meets Augustus. Augustus is in remission but his battle made him lose a leg. He doesn't dwell on it though, he uses his charm (and good looks) to befriend Hazel. In no time at all they're inseperable, they read the same books, help their friend Isaac get through the loss of his eyesight, and try to make the best out of being sick. I think I enjoyed this book so much because it isn't about the poor sick little cancer kid that needs to be pitied, this is the other side if the story, this is what it is really like for these kids living with cancer. They don't need to be pitied, they need to be understood.Again, this is a must read. It is without a doubt added to my list of all time favorites and I cannot wait to read his other works. Side note, for all you Hoosiers or Vonnegut lovers, there is a Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. reference in here. So it goes :)Read more of my reviews at: [...]"
5," John Green is a monster from the hell dimension Lacrimosa who exists only to bring soul-wracking anguish into the homes of the literate.I knew within a page that this was a book about Cancer Kids, having only picked it up because I kept reading quotes from it that I wish I had written. I don't like cancer as a plot device. Cancer is writing porn, like talking about 9/11 or the Holocaust. It's too effortless, too much emotion because of the condition which frees up the author to be lazy. Once a character is described as having cancer, the reader knows someone is going to be dead in the next hundred pages and they are going to cry. Here, we have three characters, all who had or have cancer, so the odds are against this being a lighthearted romp. Green seems to be aware of the limitations of this genre when he provides the metatextual criticism of a novel his main character likes, saying, This isn't a cancer book, because cancer books suck. (John Green seems to be all about winking at the reader, as when Hazel later says, I think you’re a pathetic alcoholic who says fancy things to get attention like a really precocious eleven-year-old and I feel super bad for you.) I figured that, understanding the genre and its tropes, I would be more or less inoculated against the worst of what he could throw at me.Never have I been so wrong. I read the book straight through between panels I did at No Such Convention. I do not recall the last time I cared enough about a book - or more wanted a book to be over - than this one. Not quite halfway in, I began bawling, If I keep reading, someone is going to die. Amber wanted more clarification, but I was reduced to making quiet walrus sounds and just thrust the book at her. This is something that occur several times throughout the novel.Spoilers: Someone dies. This does not end the book because we have not suffered enough for John Green of Lacrimosa. Not human suffering can ever be enough.My main criticism is that, despite how many times his characters mock how cancerous people behave in books and movies, every teen in this books seems to have metastasized Diablo Codyitis. These are some precocious kids, ones who toss around words like hamartia as though most teen know about tragic flaws and literary criticism. Obnoxiously precocious when it comes to one-legged bone cancer sufferer Augustus Waters, who keeps a pack of cigarettes that he does not light but will occasionally put in his mouth, using the twee logic that it is important to put the instrument of death in your mouth but not give it the power to kill you. Our poor protagonist, Hazel, was damned to fall in love with him from his introduction. And yes, the novel is a bit masturbatory, as characters pause to make sure the reader understand how special everyone is, with lines like, You are so busy being you that you have no idea how utterly unprecedented you are. I didn't really mind it. This books is overall a good metaphor for what its characters are experiencing. You come to love unreal characters you know had very exact deadlines.You get pretty much what you should expect out of this book. Yes, it is a bit cloyingly clever at times and things work out in a cinematic rather than realistic fashion. There should be a sticker on the front reading This novel brought to you by the Amsterdam Tourism Board. As long as one doesn't expect it to closely follow the edicts of reality - as long as you accept it as its own world - it is exhaustingly enjoyable, one of the most exquisite literary experiences I have enjoyed in years. So long as you know words like numinous, you may well feel the same.Ideally, it should come boxed with tissues and the number of a trained and well-read crisis counselor. I was not quite the same for days afterward."
5,"f you are familiar with John Green then you may know he is one half of Vlogbrothers, an online project with a huge fan base.  He is a New York Times Best Selling and Printz award winning author of Looking For Alaska; An Abundance of Katherines; Paper Towns; Will Grayson, Will Grayson; and most recently A Fault in Our Stars.  I must admit it took me a couple of months after hearing all the hype about John Green and A Fault in Our Stars before I finally gave it a chance.  I was a little wary of it first; thinking that it wouldn't live up to all of the hype.  I was wrong. It lived up to it all and more!Green's writing style is certainly unique and different from anything I have ever read before.  He has a way with making what would be a sad and serious story into something light and humorous, while still keeping all the heartfelt moments in all the right places.  His characters are such a delight to get to know.  The two main characters, Hazel and Augustus, talk in such clever and insightful prose that you can't help but to fall in love with them.  He doesn't overdo the sarcastic remarks by the characters or go overboard with the humor, and he gets the amount of drama and sappy moments just right.I could tell from the very beginning of this book that this was not like any other. It is not just a cancer book or a love story but a story about life and all aspects of it from friends, love, family, surviving and death.  It will ask the thought provoking questions such as - Will you leave a mark on this world? What will become of those you leave behind? And is love worth the pain? It will leave you thinking about it long after you have finished the book.Overall I thoroughly enjoyed reading A Fault in Our Stars.  It was witty, insightful, heartfelt and such a joy to read.  I recommend it for all ages young and old.  If you're a parent you will adore this book, share it with your kids you will have something new and wonderful to bond over.  If you're a teenager you'll love talking about it with your friends. It demands to be given a chance!"
5," Have you ever read a book that rips your heart out in the most excruciatingly brutal, yet beautiful way? The kind that reminds you of the fragility of life and the importance of deeply connecting with those you love? If not, then you never read The Fault in Our Stars, by John Green. As clichéd as it may sound, this book will change your life. It will fill you up with love and light, sadness and death, and make you laugh out loud at the same time. Mr. Green's writing is so intelligent, so complex and original, it will take your breath away.The Fault in Our Stars is the story of Hazel, a 17 year-old girl with terminal cancer. Knowing she doesn't have long to live, and wanting to make her parents happy, she attends a support group for kids with cancer. There, she meets Augustus Waters, a character like none I've ever read before. Augustus is beautiful inside and out and speaks in an authentic yet poetic voice throughout the novel. Augustus knows that life is short, and he wants to go out in a big, dramatic way, and make a heroic impact on the world before he goes. Hazel, however, is content with being an observer of the world, noticing the nuances of behavior and relationships. She believes that loving a select few deeply is more important than loving many far and wide. The conversations between Hazel and Augustus and their friends are sophisticated and witty. You root for them throughout the story, while knowing deep down that they are very sick and miracles are in short supply.The love story between Augustus and Hazel is luminous. And, although John Greene will rip your heart along the way, he somehow manages to give you the tools you need to recover from the pain. He manages to fill you up enough with hope and faith to make it through this story. Yes, The Fault in Our Stars is sad, at times heart wrenchingly so. But this book is so much more than that - it resonates deeply in your soul and makes you look at the world with a corrected lens, makes you see the importance of loving deeply. This book enables you to look at the surplus of beauty in your life and be grateful for it. Life is short, don't pass up The Fault in Our Stars.It's a book that will stay with you for a very long time.~Review by The Fictionista at When Pen Met Paper"
5,"ll admit it.  I did not believe I would love The Fault In Our Stars.  Yes, I'd read all of the rave reviews.  But a book about kids dying of cancer?  And not only would I love this book, but it was going to make me laugh, too?  Well, this doubting Thomas is here to tell you that my answers are a very emphatic YES and YES.Cancer books suck.  So says sixteen year-old Hazel, the wise beyond her years narrator of The Fault In Our Stars, and a cancer...victim?  No, she does not view herself as a victim.  Sufferer?  That doesn't seem quite right, either, because she's focused more on living than on the suffering that comes with cancer.  Cancer survivor?  I think she'd roll her eyes at anything that attempted to add a false feel-good tone to her certain-to-be short-lived life.  So I'll go with this - Hazel is a girl who happens to have cancer.  She views her cancer through realistic, but never bitter or self-pitying eyes.  As Hazel says, Even cancer isn't a bad guy really: cancer just wants to be alive.When we meet Hazel, she is attending a support group for kids with cancer.  She attends  the group to appease her parents, not herself; she views it as a major nuisance, at best.  All the talk of death, the discussions of feelings and fears - Hazel wants none of it.  But then she meets Augustus, a newcomer to the group.  He's missing a leg, but he's got looks and charm to spare, and he immediately intrigues Hazel.You will be in love with Hazel before you've finished the first ten or twenty pages.  And you will root for this young couple, even though you know one or both of their lives are doomed.One of the many heart-breaking aspects of this book is the suffering of her parents.  I don't have children, but I know there cannot be anything worse in this world than watching your child die.  In Hazel's case, the watching and waiting has gone on for several years.  Her father cannot participate in a discussion regarding Hazel's cancer without sobbing, and her mother has given up her own life to take care of Hazel's.  As much sympathy and love as Hazel has for them, she occasionally gets angry.  She lashes out at her mother and pleads with her to find something else to do besides taking care of a dying daughter.  After all, once Hazel is gone, what will remain for her mother?OK, that was a lot of dark stuff, and I promised you some humor.  How about these two gems? - Augustus expressed outrage that a 13 year-old Hazel used her Make a Wish on a trip to Disney World.  Hazel knew it was lame, but softened the blow by adding that she went to Epcot, too. - Hazel's friend, Kaitlyn, when discussing Augustus: I would ride that one-legged pony all the around the corral.The romance between Hazel and Augustus is one of the most beautful I've ever read.  So much so that I happily overlooked the fact that their dialogue was unlike any that I've ever heard from any teenager (or most adults, for that matter.)I kept waiting and waiting for the moment that I would need tissues.  I thought I had the outcome nailed early on, based on what I thought was a subtle clue, but I was wrong.  We're pulled along to what we believe is the inevitable conclusion until the inevitable gets flipped on its head.  And yes, then it was tissue time.On a personal note, I visited Amsterdam and the Anne Frank House a year and a half ago.  I climbed those same, steep narrow steps in the house that Hazel climbed, hauling her oxygen tank with her.  Everything that she described brought back intense memories.  If you get the chance to visit Amsterdam, the House is a must-see."
5," The Fault in Our Stars by John GreenI am going to review this book through a fictional conversation that has some truth to it.  Just in case you didn't know, I am a high school social studies teacher who loves to read and talk about books so this conversation takes place in school.Librarian Susan:  Have you read The Fault in Our Stars yet?Me:  No, Should I?Reading Teacher Sue:  (the very next day) Have you read The Fault in Our Stars yet?Me:  No. (me thinking- why do people keep talking about this book?) Have you read Looking for Alaska?  I loved it.Sue:  You really need to read it, it will change your world.Me:  OK, I will try and get it from the library.A few weeks go by and I finally get the Ebook through my library app.Me:  (at lunch talking to Elizabeth the English teacher) Have you read The Fault in Our Stars?Elizabeth:  Oh my, yes, it was amazing.  Augustus is my book boyfriend.  I am convinced he is one of the best male characters in literature today.Me:  I think I am in love with John Green.  He does something to my heart when I read his books that no one else does.  (This is only the second book I have read by John Green and I am already confessing my love.  This means something).Elizabeth and I walk to class after lunch continuing to discuss the book.  Two of my 9th grade students overhear.Students:  Where are you in the book?Me:  Page 50.  I stayed up till 11pm reading, while my husband kept snoring beside me.  I can't believe I was having this awesome reading experience and he was sleeping through it.  I had to force myself to stop reading because I needed to get up early.Students:  Have you read the part where you find out the reason the book is named, The Fault in Our Stars?Me:  No, why?Students:  Because it relates to what we are learning in class about Rome.  You know Julius Caesar and Brutus and Cassius and stuff.Me:  OMG, that is too cool.  I love it when the things we do and experience in real life show up in the history we are learning about.  Everything is connected!Next day,Elizabeth:  (through email)  Did you finish The Fault in Our Stars yet??Me:  (thinking, only 1 day has gone by, she must think I am a fast reader.)  No.  I am trying to savor it and read it as slowly as possible.  (there is some truth to that)Elizabeth:  Ok, just make sure you read the last 100 pages in private.Me: (thinking inside my head) Uh-Oh, this means I am probably going to cry.Another day goes by.Me:  (through email)  Elizabeth, I'm so sad right now.  Our book boyfriend, (did you notice I used Our instead of hers?) Augustus has cancer and I am really worried.  I might need to take a break from the ending.  My heart is breaking and I'm having trouble breathing.  (this is what happens to serious readers, when they begin to take on the characteristics of the characters they love)Elizabeth:  Total waterworks from here on out.Later on the same day while I was reading on the couchHusband: Are you crying?  About a book? (Did I mention he is a non-reader?) (Poor husband, he will never know the amazing experience of reading a book that affects your emotions in ways you cannot predict.)Me:  Yes. Can you bring me a box of tissues?  (at this point, I was nearing the end of the book)Next day at school.I walk into the room where I eat lunch.Elizabeth and I make eye contact.  She knows what I am feeling, she knows the amazing experience I just had reading The Fault in Our Stars.  She knows I can't talk about it right now.  She knows that Augustus and Hazel are amazing characters and She knows that The world is not a wish-granting factory.  She knows that the side effect of dying is cancer and that falling in love is not likely to happen when you aren't feeling your best but that it happens when you least expect it.  She knows that you must live your best life today because we don't have an infinite amount of tomorrows.  She knows as only another reader can know.  Sigh.Tomorrow when I see Elizabeth, Susan, Sue and Students, I will smile and say Okay instead of always and they will know the language I speak.Okay."
2," What can I say about this book? How can I put into words how sad and wonderful it is at the same time? Honestly, after finishing this book I needed a few days to be able to write a review.The story of 17-year-old Hazel is deeply moving, yet refreshing. A mix that you wouldn't ever expect from a cancer book, right?Hazel suffers from thyroid cancer and cannot hope to be cured someday. Death is her constant companion, but she seems to deal with this fact far better than most of the people surrounding her. She doesn't want to be pitied, she just wants to be treated like a normal teenager with normal teenage problems. A special status or cancer bonus is repulsive to her, just as self-help groups to which she drags herself in order to please her parents. There she meets attractive Gus, her great love. They discover that they have a lot in common: books, movies, music. Together they fly to Amsterdam to meet the author of An Imperial Affliction, a book which they both deeply cherished for certain reasons. A journey which is about much more than just a book in the end.The characters are incredibly compelling; there are dialogues which are not only enthralling but also full of sarcasm, wit and seriousness.Even though Hazel never would have wanted that, I pitied her :( - and all of the other cancer kids at the self-help group. I admired her for how she handles her difficult situation; she is incredibly strong, even supports her parents in an impressive way when they are threatening to collapse under the deadly fate of their daughter.I  suffered with her when she was closer to death than ever before, from all that water in her lungs... I was happy with her too when, for a short time, she could feel like a normal teenage girl who is in love for the very first time. The relationship between Hazel and Gus was characterized by a deep emotional connection, mutual understanding and interest. They talked about everything under the sun, there was no topic they wouldn't discuss - slowly they grew together, until they knew each other inside out. It broke my heart to follow and witness the growth of this great love.I shed tears over this book. It is definitely not an easy read that John Green presents to his readers; neither the content nor linguistically. The chapters are full of poetry and literature which is thought-provoking yet difficult to understand sometimes. People who are looking for a lowbrow read should rather move on to another novel.I can only warmly recommend to everyone TO READ THIS BOOK.No, it is not a cancer book, it is the story of the strong, yet weakened Hazel and both her great loves: Gus and life."
5," This is one of those books that I wish I had 6 stars to give. I was a little worried when starting it fo a few reasons:1)It's #1 on the NY Times best seller list; I'm sometimes weary of books that are too popular being over-rated. I dislike reading books that everyone else says I *should*.2)Another blogger posed the question as to whether or not this book would have been so well-received had a woman written it? Now, I'm not a reverse sexist when it comes to writers, so I don't really care what your gender is if I like the writting style. But a man pulling off a legit-sounding voice for a teenage female character is tough to do. Green nailed it.3)I was worried I couldn't look past my editing pet-peeves that littere the book, such as Over Capitalization over Arbitrary Things. Oh, and: an overusage of misplaced colons. To name a few.4)I'm not generally a huge fan of reading some maudlin book about a teenager dying of cancer. (Good thing this wasn't that type of book!)All that said, I gave it a chance, and I will forever be grateful I did. Green masters Hazel's voice, and I simply fell in love with her snarkiness and imperfections. The book is beautifully written--tragic in one breath, endearing in the next. And I love, love, love the quirky love story between Augustus (not Gus to me either) and Hazel. Beautifully woven, smart and funny people, and a love that will not soon leave your heart. Green also masters the art of going there with his plot line, without going too far or being too icky with the teenage characters. Very realistic, very raw and emotional.As a parent, I don't have the luxury to sit and blow through a book this quickly, but I could not put this down and read it in about a day and a half. Like Hazel's An Imperial Affliction, this was a book I actually underlined, starred favorite passages, went back and reread particularly beautifully written lines that deserved extra attention, and will go back and reread (maybe a dozen times).Some books just touch you more than others. This book surprised me, had me laughing, had me tearing up, had me thinking about life, death, the universe, and our place in it, and actually saying, no, no, no to a plot twist I was least suspecting -- and it's not what you'd think with a girl dying of cancer.Superbly written, Mr. Green. This is a genius I someday hope to leave with readers as well."
5,"n John Greens book, The Fault in Our Stars I really connected with each character and felt like I was on their journey with them. I chose this book because all my friends kept begging me to read it and they were also telling me how amazing it was. The story line that John Green chose to write was about a seventeen-year-old girl named Hazel. Hazel was more then just a seventeen-year-old girl. She had a disability throughout her life and she wasn't ready to live it with her cancer. She would stick at home with her mom and she didn't have many friends. She went to a weekly Support Group where she talked about her cancer with others. There at the Support Group she meets a boy named Augustus Waters. Little did she know that this boy could change her life.  Augustus changes Hazel's mind about the cancer and really gets her up and going. It was like a roller coaster, Ups and Downs. Like the times where Hazel and Augustus would just hang out as regular teenagers, not talking or complaining about cancer. Or when they go on an amazing journey together. I love a good fiction book but I have never found one as good as this one. Reading this book during class and or at home I never wanted to put it down. It was such a page-turner. Just seeing where or what Hazel and Augustus would do next. Augustus and Hazel seemed like they were alive in my life. John Green really made me feel like I was there with them, through every part in the book. His book really connects people, parents, kids, teenagers, everyone! Although it was a sad book it was also very exciting and happy. I recommend this book to 8th graders and above. Many young kids will not be able to understand some of the big vocabulary in the book and also some of the inappropriate words. Of course there were tears but they were always followed by a laugh. If you are interested in an exciting unpredictable teenage love story kind of book then you must stop what you are doing and read The Fault in Our Stars, you will not regret it."
5," Beautiful. Elegant. Brutally Honest. Absolutely fantabulously amazing.I love John Green's writing! I completely and utterly worship his literary genius! If you have not yet read any of his work, I implore you to please pick this one up! This book is an incredible read. It's one of those books that gets inside you, curls itself around your heart and then stays there forever. I will never be able to forget the brilliance that is The Fault in Our Stars.In classic John Green style; this book is amusing, witty, and very thought-provoking. I loved every single moment of it. It's about three young cancer patients who are willing to make fun of themselves, who are cynical yet optimistic and who are just trying to survive. They made me laugh out loud and cry for the crap hand they were dealt. I felt emotionally connected to every single character, from the cancer patients to their friends and family. Hell, I could even sympathise a little with that Amanda bitch. This book also brought up the issue of death and oblivion a lot. While this may seem depressing, I have actually never wanted to get out there and live my life to the fullest than after finishing it! It really got me thinking about what I believe and what I would do if I knew that I was dying. God, this book is just SO good.I worry that a lot of people will be hesitant to read this because of its depressing contents. I too am a little bit guilty of this; I put this one off for a while because I was unsure about reading something that I knew would break my heart. And yes, it is depressing and you will probably cry but this is definitely a story worth reading. This story is flat out honest, it doesn't sugar coat any of the issues. It has opened my mind to things that I never would have contemplated before; about life, love and death. I think this is a great story for anyone of any age.All living humans - PLEASE READ THIS."
4,"t's been a long time since I read a book that made me cry.Pass the tissues please.It's not even that this book was terribly sad. Of course it is, it has its moments. It is, after all, a book about cancer patients - young cancer patients - and all that comes along with that death sentence of a diagnosis. The sad parts were, well, sad - the eulogies written before death, hopes shattered, dreams stripped away. But it wasn't the desolation that got to me. The Sad wasn't what consumed this book or consumed me.The Bittersweet. That's what got me.It's a book about cancer patients. And The Sad. The impact. The grenade. The loss. The way life goes on. The impact we want to make with our lives. The impact we never quite reach.Ashes to ashes and whatnot.The Bittersweet...it got me. Living in a moment you know can't last. Living in a moment and knowing YOU can't last. You won't last. Your time is short and even shorter for some.John Green attempts to make sense of the senseless with this little gem. That's what it is, after all. Senseless. Seventeen year olds aren't supposed to die from cancer. Seventeen years aren't supposed to be cheated out of lives they'll never get the chance to live.Sad books aren't normally something I reach for; my shelves aren't lined with tragedy. Life is hard enough without immersing yourself in someone else's personal hell for 318 pages, but I'm glad I did with this one.That Bittersweet...the bittersweet made it worth it.This John Green cat... he knows his way around language and has the ability to craft a sentence that makes me stop and read it again immediately because I want that little piece of beauty seared into my memory forever.It got me."
5," This story was AMAZING! There are times in the book that brought me to tears, as well as times when I was cheering Hazel Grace and Augustus on every step of the way.This is a story that is hard to tell and read.  No one wants to think about a child getting cancer and the challenges that it brings into their lives.  The greatest benefit that I got from this book was the perspective of the cancer patient, Hazel, that tells the story in the book.  My own brother was diagnosed with cancer about 9 months ago and there are so many times that I don't know what to say or do.  I see people treating people with cancer differently as if their personality changed overnight to this person that is sick and helpless now.  The truth is that it can happen to any of us at any point in our lives.  Our job is to make sure that those we love know it and that we show it as often as we can.  There are no guarantees how long we have to mark our mark on the world.  Making a difference in the world and leaving a legacy of their lives was a key point discussed multiple times.  A person may have 80 years or 16 years to leave that mark, but the length of time doesn't determine how great an impact we can have on those we love and love us.Some details that I especially appreciated, given I'm going through this process with my brother right now, is that they want life to be as normal as possible.  The patient doesn't want to be the center of attention and a novelty for others to watch and comment upon.  Even when we have the best of intentions, too often we are looking at the situation from our perspective and the impact its having on our lives, instead of what the patient is going through.  I know that is true for me and it was a wake up call for me to focus on the right things.  Focus on all the great things about the person and the impact they have had on everyone around them.  Also, there are times when there truly is NOTHING to say.  Its ok to just be there and and be silent.  That can be as big a comfort as saying the exact right words, because there really aren't any perfect words for the situation.  Bottom line it SUCKS to have cancer.  Its how Hazel and Augustus chose to fight the battle that made the greatest impact on the reader.While there were tears and cheers at times, I found the story to be exactly what I needed to hear to try to be the best sister I can to my brother right now.John Green, thanks so much for pouring your heart and soul into this story.  It definitely showed!I give this book a SOLID 5 out of 5 stars!!"
5," Wow. Just wow.Here's a book that I was just too damn cheap to buy full price, even though the cover blurb grabbed me when I first came across it. So, I waited my turn at the library, and finally got lucky when the audio version was added to the collection (still haven't gotten my call for the hard copy.) This was no problem for me, as I enjoy audio versions, both when driving or for listening to when I'm doing tasks around the house. For this book, though, I invented tasks as an excuse to listen. When those ran out, I just sat like a lump and followed Hazel and Gus through their days.This is a book that reaches out and grabs your heart from the get-go. Green has created powerful characters, brought us into their everyday world, and made it vibrant, heart-wrenching, and beautiful. This is not always an easy task, for there's very little about cancer that is beautiful. But there is a great deal that is glorious in the two young people in this story. Synopses abound. Go read one if you wish, but it cannot adequately prepare for how engaging this story is.A bonus to the audio version is that there is an interview with Green. I really appreciated his insights on the story, writing, life with cancer, and more. I also found out that he has done an audio version of the book, primarily for the fans of his vlog, who wanted to hear his inflections to the story. The audio version I listened to was superb, and as Green said, he was much happier to hear Hazel say, you're so hot in a female voice than in his lovely baritone.Oddly enough, while reading this, I also read of Neil Gaiman's participation in  An Evening of Awesome at Carnegie Hall (available on youtube) presented last week by Hank and John Green.Watch the video, and you'll get to hear the stars of The Lizzie Bennet Diaries (which also involves Hank Green) read the wonderful section in the museum (won't say more because of spoilers.)10 out of 5 stars. Yes, I liked it."
5,"n all honesty, this book broke me. I came out of it stronger though. Every time that story regained my trust, it dropped a bomb on my head and absolutely shattered me. Bravo, to Mr. Green, for concocting such a masterpiece of wit, cleverness, poetry, death, life, and all the intricacies of what it means to be human and to suffer for it. Hazel is the ideal heroine, terminally ill, lonely and unhappy, but she presses on in life- for herself, her family, and all others around her- even though death is constantly looming in the shadows. She finds a new reason to fight to live in Augustus, the attractive boy she meets that happens to be hilarious, terribly clever, and a cancer survivor currently in remission. It's extremely hard to not to love and feel for each character on a person level, as there is something relatable squeezed into every one of their personalities. Hazel, funny, smart, with a love of reading poetry but not for writing it. Augustus, clever, charming, seemingly fearless but underneath he is frightened he'll become sick again. Hazel's Parents, easily worried, very protective (which is understandable in this circumstance), loyal, and the father is just a touch more on the emotional side than you would come to expect. I have absolutely no complaints. Green's style of writing is truly remarkable, he portrayed the thoughts and conversations of the teens that were the main of the story incredibly well, almost as if he was that age when he wrote it. The plot of the story was so incredibly thought out, everything fit, you were never confused to what was happening or how something happened, you never had a chance to guess what was coming next because you were too entranced in what you were comprehending right that second. That, was one of the huge reasons this book was so heartbreaking. It is exactly like life. You never know what happens on the next page, or even in the next sentence, because you're to busy living to anticipate it. I would suggest reading this with a box of tissues close by, you'll need it."
5," always saw this book under my recommended and I always put it off because it was a cancer book. And I remember watching a movie about two teens that are both cancer patients and they fall in love... (they both died in the end) Anyways that movie effectively put me off anything having to due with sick, star-crossed lovers.While many people say this is NOT a cancer book, I have to disagree. It is. It's everything people avoid because it's real and depressing. HOWEVER, this book is so much more than a cancer book, and I can't picture the impacting result happening if cancer wasn't a big part of the book. So, don't be put off by the cancer aspect, but be prepared for it.(And begins the rant about how amazing this book is)This book surpasses everything I have been forced to read as a student, screw the classics - give me more John Green!! The author is an absolute natural; his words just flow and he has the way of making the story so much more than just a story. I can't even write a review to do John Green justice, all I can say is that it is a pleasure to read anything written by him.The story itself puts Romeo and Juliet to shame. The connection between the two is so deep and real that you find yourself falling in love aswell. ( Not in a creepy I now have a fictional boyfriend way but in way that these characters will always stay with you).Hazel is one of a kind.. that's really the only way to define her. She's strong, obviously, but she's so rational that it's refreshing. I think the phrase, an old soul is how I think of her. Truly amazing character.Now, Augustus (LOVE THE NAME), is something else! While Hazel remains accepting of the fact that her time is limited, Augustus isn't. The reader gets to witness his struggle with death. It's a sad one, but mainly it's a fun one. His zest for life and for rememberance is so relatable yet unrealsitc.Anyways, I am rambling. This book is worth the $11 dollars. I actually feel smarter from reading it! I also want to cry and mourn fictional characters, but never-the-less, I loved this book. Easily one of my favorites.Buy it.BTW, John Green is AMAZING!"
5," You have to read this book, It's amazing!That is the first thing my friend told me about this story, and that is the least you could say about it.The Fault in Our Stars - What does this title mean to you?  When I started to read this book, I thought the title was catchy. I didn't know what it meant so I was curious to find out. The Fault in Our Stars is about two Indianapolis teenagers who find each other at a cancer support group meeting. Hazel, the smart, beautiful, shy girl is battling terminal thyroid cancer. This makes her very tired and she needs to use an oxygen tank wherever she goes. Augustus, the cute, all around american male teenager, has a fake leg because he had a malignant bone tumor. He wins her heart, and together they start to live a life like they never thought about before.Hazel's favorite novel, An Imperial Affliction, by Peter Van Houten is about a girl with cancer who is still living a good life but the book ends and she doesn't know what happens. Hazel tries to contact Van Houten but she never had any luck. Augustus gets introduced to the book and he ends up getting in contact with him. The author promises to answer any questions about the book if they come to Amsterdam. Augustus uses a Wish he received because of his previous poor health to take Hazel and her mother to Amsterdam.This book starts out a bit slow, but to me it was still very interesting. Something new and/or exciting was always happening in the chapters. The lives of Augustus and Hazel were always changing, I was always waiting for something new to happen to them. There were some things about the science content that i didn't understand. The book was talking about cancer machines, oxygen tanks and different kinds of symptoms. I don't know much about cancer but I looked those words up easily and I knew what was going on. This story is very believeable. John Green did a very good job describing the characters. As the book went along I was finding myself picturing what they looked like, where they were, and what they were doing. I was always interested in what was going to happen next, I never ever got bored with it!This science fiction story was presented well. As I said, I don't know a lot about cancer, but this story helped me to understand more about it. I would like to continue to learn more about cancer and the treatments and how they destroy the cancerous cells. To me it was very interesting. In the acknowledgments, Green mentions that the word Phalanxifor was made up. It doesn't exist. Phalaxifor was the drug prescribed for Hazel's cancer. The drug was supposed to slow the cancer cell growth. The disease is treated fictitiously in this novel.Overall this book was amazing. I really liked how things were written and what they meant to the story and to the book. I could really relate to the main character- Hazel. We both think alike, she appreciates the little things in life and so do I. This book deserves 5 stars. I would recommend this book to people 13 years or older. This would be a great book for teenagers who have cancer. The story would show them that you can still be happy and live your life. It would also be great for people who have friends, or parents with cancer. I have read a lot of books but none like this. This book has made me wonder and learn about cancer. It's different and I really like that. The Fault in Our Stars is truly an amazing story."
2," Hazel is a brilliant character that I understood way to well. I have been chronically sick for five years, and while it is a totally different disease. I have felt the sense of impending doom that Hazel has. I also understood what it meant to be a professional sick teen, because I lived it for two years. Green captured this aspect perfectly. I found it hard to read at times, because the emotions still exist in me from those experiences. Augustus was amazing. He was witty and funny. I loved his personality. At times, there language seemed a bit dense, but after further thought, it fit the character in a immensely fantastic way. The parents were also involved in the book, which is something I love in Young Adult Fiction and definitely added to the story. The characters were amazing and made this book even more lovely.The plot of the book was amazing. While it dealt with being sick, it also dealt with the miracle that is life. I loved the sense of adventure and humor that were tangled between ever single aspect of this book. I have been a fan of John Green for several years and was really excited for his new novel. His writing was just as magical and extraordinary. He captured the essence that exist when you are between being dead and healthy. A lot that he wrote, is something that I have thought or felt at some point since getting sick. There were a few small medical things that seemed wrong from my experiences in the last five years. At the same time, John Green's writing is executed in a beautiful matter that I couldn't help adoring this book. I highly recommend that you read this book as soon as possible. This story is full of emotions that will clutch your heart, long after you have finished it. It is one of my favorite books that I have read in a long time."
5," have had this book for many months. But because I'm a coward I didn't read it until now. I was still afraid, though. With good reason. This book is heartbreaking. It's so sad. But only very near the ending. And it's so damn good that you cannot not love it. The Fault in Our Stars is a book about love. And it's perfect. It's also a book about cancer and living with it. Which is all kinds of awful. But it's also a happy book with lots of young love and happiness and it's all just so good and I never wanted it to end. But it did. So heartbreakingly good and gut wrenching.This is the story of Hazel. A sixteen year old girl with cancer. I won't try to explain her sickness, because I would most likely suck at it. But know that it is awful, so awful. But it's also so perfect and so well written and I loved it a lot. It sort of gave life to the character, even if the cancer is slowly killing her. It's so interesting to read about. She has to have this oxygen tank on at all times, and while that sort of disturbed me a bit, I also loved it. It's unique, and it just made me love her a lot more.There is a lot of pain in my heart from reading this book. A lot of pain. First there is pain for Hazel. She seems so sad all the time. And I totally get that. But she's also pretty happy, and I loved that. But she does everything for her parents, and that was sad. But I understand it so well. I actually loved her parents. They love her so much. And it's just so awful for them as well. Her dad is crying all the time. But he's also so caring and kind and I just adored him. Same with her mom. They were awesome.This is also a book about Augustus. Hazel meets him at this cancer kid support group. He's deadly handsome. And just so amazing. Most likely my favorite character. It's just impossible not to love him. He's perfect. Gorgeous, kind, funny. Everything you want in a boy. He's also a great friend, perfect boyfriend. Another I loved in this book was Isaac, he's best friend. He's adorable. He also gets his heart broken. It was awful. But also so amazing. He was just really fun to read about. And I enjoyed that a lot.There is a lot of sick kids in this book. But it isn't all about sickness. But those sick people we do get to know.. it's, well, heartbreaking. I don't have another word for it. There is just so much pain. But it's so good and I couldn't get enough of it all. I loved reading about Isaac's cancer. And Hazel's. And mostly Augustus's. It was just so bad. But so perfect. And I have no words for how good this book was. I'm doing my best to describe it, but I'm pretty sure I'm failing. I need a sequel to this book. Truly.The plot in this book is amazing. Hazel is such an amazing girl. She loves this book that she's read so many times. She gets Gus to read it, and he falls in love with it as well. And I loved that so much. It was adorable. She has tried so many times to get in contact with the author of that book. And it's kind of amazing. There is even a trip to Amsterdam. Best trip ever. But also most sad one. I hated that author. Really hated him. But it was so good to read about. And it was done so well and I loved it lots.The romance in this book is so great. It's sweet and amazing and just so perfect. I loved it so much. First there isn't much, I mean, there is flirting from the beginning which was awesome. But Hazel is trying to keep Gus from being hurt if she dies. But she gets over that. And then everything gets so much better. And it's all so good. And the romance is so sweet and I just wanted more and more. But we also got so much, and I will always cherish it. Swooning a bit right now, just thinking about it.I'm not sure what else to say about this plot. It's so good. So much amazing things happens. So much heartbreak and painful and awful things. And it is all so good. And I just loved every part of this book. I know I will re-read The Fault in Our Stars so many times. It is a book that must be read and loved a whole bunch of times. You need to read it. Seriously. This is not a book to be missed. While it is full of heartbreak, it is also so good and happy and sweet and it all makes so much sense at the end. Well, okay, I still hated that thing at the end. But it's so good that you can't really dislike it too much.There is this tiny thing that I will spoil. I will not spoil how this book ends. What it ends with. How it happens. But I will say that something happens. And ah. It's awful. But anyway. I kind of new it before starting this book, so I'm hoping that you do too. I was sure there would be a death in this book. And there is. And it's awful. But it also surprised me a whole lot. And it was even worse than I had thought. And it's so unfair. But it also beyond perfect and I just can't decide how to feel about it. I want a sequel to this book. I really do. But there should not be one. I just need to know what happens to this one character. I also want deleted scenes. Many of those. Pretty please. &lt;3Once you start reading this book you cannot stop. I had been planning on just reading a little bit of it today. I didn't know it would be so addictive. But it was. And I had to finish it right away. So glad that I did. This book is just perfection. The writing is amazing. The characters are perfect, well, flawed, but still so perfect and so well written. There wasn't a single thing to hate in this book. Okay. That isn't really true. There was this thing happening at the end. So heartbreaking and unfair. So much sobbing."
5," don't think a book has touched me this much in a long time.  Where to begin?First of all, this book is considered young adult, but I am 34 and read it because I was looking for something good to read.  I saw that it had been voted the best young adult novel of the year by Goodreads.com (I hope I'm accurate here; will have to double-check).  I had read the adult winners already, and the summary intrigued me.Hazel is a 16 year old girl who has had terminal cancer for the last three years.  Basically, she knows she is dying, doesn't know how much time she has left, and is understandably depressed and grappling with this and all that comes along with it.  At a cancer support group, she meets a survivor named Augustus Waters.  He has been cancer-free for over a year, had his leg amputated, but is otherwise in pretty good shape. The two of them become very good friends, and are obviously attracted to each other and want more.  However, Hazel is resisting this- becoming romantically involved- because she knows she's not going to be around forever (how much time she has is kind of vague, but it doesn't sound good), and wants to minimize the pain she causes him.What I like about this book as that, while the subject matter is depressing, Hazel and Augustus are so smart.  I love the way Green wrote them as these extremely smart and funny teenagers with all this insight and wisdom into the world, their disease, and human nature.  I have had family members with cancer, and the way he writes about their families is so honest.  While it was sad, parts felt so triumphant and had me laughing out loud.This is a love story that I feel resonates with all ages.  I couldn't put it down, and I know that Hazel and Gus will stay with me for a long time."
5," Gah, this book. My friends have been trying to get me to read this book for MONTHS, but I refused to read it because I hate sad books (or sad movies, or sad ANYTHING) with a passion. I guess that's a bit childish and stubborn of me, but that's just me - I always want to be happy :) But this book was so worth all the pushing and shoving. This is the first novel I've ever read by John Green, and I will definitely be reading many more, without the insistence of my friends pushing me forward. The writing was phenomenal and the scenes flew together so nicely, which I always like in a book - and I'm assuming so does everyone. No one likes choppy scenes or having to go back and reread the last page because they're not sure what just happened.I also connected with the characters very easily, and was quickly sucked into the story. The conversations between the characters were so believable and human-like... it's hard to explain. And sometimes the conversations turned really insightful, sometimes so insightful I reread and reread the line because I liked it so much. Okay, I kinda just contradicted myself. To be more clear, sometimes there would be conversations between Hazel Grace and Augustus that you (or I, anyway) could connect with because it sounded like you were talking to your best friends. And then sometimes, the conversations would turn so in-depth or thoughtful that (technically I suppose this is a downside to the novel, but it didn't bother me at all when I was reading so whatever) you kinda felt rather unintelligent at their piles and piles of intelligence. It was almost like talking to these teenage philosophers at some points when really, you were just hearing John Green's voice through the teens. But these bits of very insightful comments didn't bother me - I thought they just enhanced the story.In short, this is a beautiful book that everyone should read. Lots and lots of stars."
5," normally do not write reviews on Amazon. But TFiOS converted me to come out of my virtual hidey-hole and give a review on this book.I'll be honest. The first time I read it, I was let down and thought it to be anti-climactic after rushing through it. I read it a second time more slowly. A third. A fourth. Slowly but surely, I loved it more and more to the point I can now affirm wholeheartedly with the person who wrote a message to the potential buyer (me) on a store receipt inside the book I found after I purchased it. The message proclaimed, THIS IS THE BEST BOOK IN THE HISTORY OF FOREVER! GET IT-- YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED. :) I think the person's action in leaving a message speaks volumes in and of itself.This is not to say this is everyone's cup of tea. Perhaps one will read it countless times and not be wowed, and that's perfectly fine. After all, no book is going to appeal to everyone. But what TFiOS accomplishes, at least to me, is that it sidesteps the entire cliche of tragicomedies relating to teens and cancer, and shows who they are: human, with faults and flaws and humor and zeal. I can imagine a Hazel and Gus so perfectly; they can be my peers in class. The parents could be just like mine. But this is not a fairy tale. In its imperfect but well-developed characters and plot, it is paradoxically a near-perfect book. The prose is succinct and so Green-esque. One sentence had me tearing up, the next had me howling on the subway in laughter, with people giving me wary glances.I always appreciated John Green's work, because he never dumbed down the teenage population, and although I am past the teenage fiction age group, I appreciate it more and more as time goes by. It's like fermentation-- they get better with age, such as kimchee and wine. This book is no exception."
5," Sometimes we get to read a really good book.  If we are lucky, we might even get to read a great book once in a while. But then there is also `that kind of book'. You know what I mean. The kind of book that you swore you was only going to read a couple of pages of that evening, but by 3 am you had flipped the final page and realized you had read through the whole thing. The kind of book that your thoughts keep returning to, even though you have long since finished reading it.The Fault in our Stars by John Green is just `that kind of book'.The voice of Hazel, our lovely main character and narrator, is sharp and witty and you instantly get the impression that she is very wise beyond her years. Hazel has a very straightforward and clear view of the world she lives in. Hazel has no pretenses about her decease and she knows she will never get well, but, as Augustus points out to us in the story, her strong personality shines through in everything she does and makes her more alive than any of the characters I have had the pleasure to follow in a very long time.Augustus, a boy Hazel meets at cancer kid support group, is charming and just as witty as Hazel. They are two very compatible individuals and their relationship helps them both to really get out of their shells. When Hazel and Augustus interact with each other, we get to see everything that they are, everything that they wish to be, and at times even what they might become, and that itself takes serious masterful writing.I might not have read that many stories about people with terminal deceases, but I have no doubt that The Fault in Our Stars is as authentic as it is going to get. There is no sugar coating or glorification of this book; It is just about a seventeen year old girls with lungs that suck at being lungs.I will be perfectly honest with you though, I cried like a little girl when I finished it, and yet this is a book I will return to and re-read many times in the future.John Green, I thank you for sharing this amazing book with the rest of us and I look forward to reading more of your work."
5," From my blog 4 1/2What a great read, I actually enjoyed, almost loved a hyped book, I have to agree that this one deserves the hype, wow wow wow.  And............ it is YA, not my cup of tea but it had me engaged the whole time.  Something about the summary and reviews, I was intrigued, very glad I gave it a try.An emotional book with lots of humour, dark humour, childish humour, many many many laughs throughout the story.I loved getting to know teenagers that are not the norm, almost everyone had cancer in different forms and a major plus is that the parents were included in the story.  Hazel and Gus had their own language, what I consider true soul mates.  I loved their journey, my favourite parts were the dialogue throughout the story, fascinating, beautiful, emotional and downright hilarious.The scenarios of what Hazel and Gus chose has their wish, kind of Wish Foundation was so amazing I was touched.  Gus reaction to Hazel's was a favourite funny part.  Quote Hazel GRACE! he shouted.  You did not use your one dying Wish to go to Disney World with your parents.  Also Epcot Center, I mumbled. Oh, my God, Augustus said.  I can't believe I have a crush on a girl with such cliche wishes.  Seriously, that is the best dialogue ever.I think this book will pass the test of time and 10 years from now will still be on reader and book stores favourite lists.I highly recommend this one, I think everyone will enjoy.  There is so much in this book and the reviews I have read give minimal, mainly I believe because you just have to experience it for yourselves without any prior knowledge of details.I have to now go read more John Green, he may just become my YA go to author when I'm in the mood."
5," When deciding to read John Green's The Fault In Our Stars, I knew what I was setting myself up for. I've officially accepted that I am indeed a masosadist.That's the thing about pain...it demands to be felt.I've lost a lot of people to cancer in my lifetime. From a young age, I've learned to coupe with these grenades in anyway imaginable, much as you read about in Stars.Off topic, but: What a slut time is. She screws everybody.Green's Book is the story of life through eyes that are very much living for the moment. People told me that I would cry. Did I? Yes, and actually on two flights between Milwaukee and Fort Lauderdale {marvelous timing for a sad read right?!}. But I unlike many readers didn't find myself crying from start to finish. What some saw as a depressing story about death and sickness, I saw a story of survival, love, and honesty which was beautiful to read.Oh, I wouldn't mind, Hazel Grace. It would be a privilege to have my heart broken by you.Hazel and Augustus put things in perspective for you. I got all the way to 78% before I started to cry. I was starting to think I was heartless, but as I sat to start writing the review, I just realized that I related so much to this read. More than any book I've ever read.Only now that I loved a grenade did I understand the foolishness of trying to save others from my own impending fragmentation: I couldn't unlove Augustus Waters. And I didn't want to.I ultimately read this book because I didn't believe Green could write a story that truly embraced how it felt to deeply love a person, with cancer, and lose them. The feeling is indescribable, and in the end, yeah, I got my answer. Wow. Dead on. Glad I read it, but I'm going to find my heart. I think it's on the floor, stomped on.You don't get to choose if you get hurt in this world, old man, but you do have some say in who hurts you. I like my choices. I hope she likes hers.Warning: You will cry {I currently have a stomach ache just writing this review}, your heart will be broke, and you will be a better person after finishing this book. And have the next read ready, I walked around in a haze for hours until I could start my post The Fault In Our Stars book. But I promise, it's worth it.Finally, since there were SOOOO many good quotes in this book, thought I would add a few more then I usually do...The world is not a wish-granting factory.Without pain, how could we know joy?' This is an old argument in the field of thinking about suffering and its stupidity and lack of sophistication could be plumbed for centuries but suffice it to say that the existence of broccoli does not, in any way, affect the taste of chocolate.You realize that trying to keep your distance from me will not lessen my affection for you. All efforts to save me from you will fail.The real heroes anyway aren't the people doing things; the real heroes are the people NOTICING things, paying attention.The marks humans leave are too often scars.Review By Brittany for Fiction and Fashion Book BlogRead this review and more at [...][...]"
5," Full review on Reader's Dialogue: [...]Hazel and Augustus are both really likable characters. Yes, they're weird. But in the best way possible, in a way that takes a horrible thing like terminal cancer and makes it secondary to the life they're living now, to the pressing, important issues that completely overshadow cancer - like what happens to the hamster in An Imperial Affliction. Because how could Hazel die without knowing that? By the way - Sisyphus as a name for a hamster? Brilliant. But seriously - if not for the constant reminder of Hazel's tubes and Augustus's leg, I might have forgotten at some points that these are sick teens. Which is kind of the point.Right from the start, it's obvious that Hazel is frustrated at how the cancer took hold of her life and dominates every move she makes, and every decision her family makes. So when she begins living a life where cancer is peripheral, when she lets herself love and doesn't worry - too much - about how having cancer fits with having a boyfriend, it changes everything. Her mother is happy about it - though why she pulled Hazel out of school when she just wants her to continue having normal interactions with people is beyond me. That's not a criticism of the author. To the contrary, I think it sounds perfectly realistic, and it made me think about how people react to illness. Hazel's mom is so afraid of things that she reacts that way, but when Hazel starts changing things, her mom does too.For me, there were two parts to the book. The first, more obvious, part is the exploration of how people deal with illness and death. There's a large enough cast of characters besides Hazel and Augustus's families that we get to see more than a few reactions. And the book is just peppered with pithy comments and observations about life, about death, about humanity's place in the universe.But the other part that I connected to just as much is the exploration of what a book is, what a novelist is. Green prefaces the novel with a note about how everything in the novel is made up and readers shouldn't try to search for facts in it. And then Hazel is obsessed with finding out what happens to the characters after the end of An Imperial Affliction. And the way that turns out seems to be a comment on the essence of novels and novelists, following from this preface. I love how Hazel's quest to find out the ending turns out. It winds up affecting both parts of the book, the exploration of novels as well as the exploration of death and dying.With all its serious subject matter, The Fault in Our Stars manages to be - not exactly fun, but close to it. Definitely it has some laugh-out-loud moments. And some teary ones, but they're balanced. It's a beautiful love story, in the larger sense of love."
5," have been anticipating this book for a while now.  Not just because it's by John Green who is an amazing writer.  But also because I like the premise of the story.A dying sixteen year old girl named Hazel Grace meets Augustus Waters, a gorgeous boy who also happens to have cancer.  He falls for her fast.  But Hazel, knowing her death is near, pulls back.  Both are quick witted with very deep thoughts about everything, including a particular book written by a recluse, Peter Van Houten.  So Gus decides to use his one WISH (basically a wish granted as a gift by The Genie Foundation specifically for very sick children) to take Hazel to Amsterdam to meet the author.  The trip turns out to be good and bad.  Bad because Houten is a drunk loser who tells them nothing they want to know.  And Good because finally Hazel relents to loving Gus back.  But just when happiness seems possible for the two, Gus finds out his cancer has spread.  Now it's just a matter of time before one of them dies.The first few chapters were hard to process.  It felt like I was watching Joey and Dawson in the 90's TV show Dawson's creek in the way they talked to each other.  As if existentialism is a part of their daily discussion.  But slowly I fell in love with Hazel and Gus.  So much so that I almost bawled at the pre-eulogy.  But that's getting ahead of the book.  One thing about both is that they are brave, they fight to live and to love. Gus is a sweetheart.  His sunny disposition and love for Hazel breaks down her walls.  But the tables are turned past half of the book.  And you'll see Hazel come into her own for Gus. To help him accept the hand they've been dealt.This is a great book that will squeeze you dry of tears.  Your heart will break. And you will be devastated.  But you will also appreciate that life is a gift, and that loving, no matter how short it may be, is always worth the eventual heartbreak.  Read it and weep."
2," Let me preface this by saying, I'm not much of a reader. That's not to say I am illiterate nor do I hate to read. Quite the contrary actually. I am just more of a video gamer, and that takes up most of my time so I spend little of it reading. I do have a wonderful friend who once in a while is able to goad me away from the T.V. or computer and make me delve into something a little more literary in nature now and then, and usually, as a result, I end up with a new favorite book to add to my collection. (Though I actually bought this book first and prompted her to read it, and of course she breezed through it, loved it, and then had to prompt me to read it. Repeatedly. But I digress.) What I am trying to say is that I rarely read, so it's an even rarer occurrence that I read the entirety of a book in a single day as I did with this one.Let me just say that I've read few things that were as achingly beautiful yet as brutally honest as John Green's latest novel.  It deals in a very frank manner, with the issues of life, death, illness, love, relationships and all points in between. It centers around a trio (mostly a duo) of teenagers who are either suffering from or recovering from various cases of cancer, but by no means is this some depressive plodding sob-fest,(Though it certainly has its heart wrenching moments). On the contrary this gorgeously nuanced, brilliantly insightful novel will have you laughing out loud and crying your eyes out, many times within the confines of the same page. It will make you contemplate your mortality and realize just how much you treasure those you love.I cannot stress this enough. Go buy this book, and read it immediately. You won't regret it. I know I certainly didn't. My only regret is that I didn't read it sooner. Don't make the same mistake."
5," This is the first book of 2012 going on my favorites list.  I'm always afraid to say I really loved a book so much it's on my favorites list because sometimes that wonderful feeling kind of fades and you later realize that it maybe wasn't quite as amazing as you thought.  That favorites list has to be saved for the truly amazing books.  And I rarely add books to it.  But when I read this book I had no doubt in my mind that it belongs on that list.  It truly is a special book that I doubt will ever fade from my memory.This is a book that takes you on a roller coaster ride.  It's full of amazing witty and hilarious characters.  But these characters are dealing with so much.  You know from the description that this is not just some happy go lucky book.  Cancer is a tough and scary thing and there are many revelations to be had when facing life and death.  There are very few books that have made me feel as much as this one.  This book had me laughing hysterically and sobbing all in the same sentence.  It truly was an epic ride and one of the best I've ever been on.John Green is an expert in creating characters that really truly stand out.  That are super smart and witty and full of some seriously awesome humor.  And I've come to love quite a few of his characters.  But in this book, this book they are more.  These are my most favorite cast of characters yet.  They stand far above the others in any of his books.  They were truly perfect.  And to be perfect they were of course flawed and real.  But they were smart and witty and absolutely hilarious.  They had to overcome so much and they had to find strength to deal with stuff that we all hope we never have to face.I honestly could ramble on about the awesomeness in this book but there really are no words to really describe this book.  It's just perfection and please go get a box of tissue and sit down and read this book now.  I promise, you won't regret it!"
5," started out merely as a fan of John Green, the video blogger on the internet with his brother and so pined to get a hold of his books to read.I live in Asia so it's not the easiest thing to go into a bookshop and finding whatever you want.I finally found Looking For Alaska, loved it and recommended it to all my friends, I also enjoyed Will Grayson, Will Grayson (which he co wrote).It was when he was promoting The fault in our stars last year, did I preorder my copy via Amazon online, since I wanted to support him in any way I could, I loved all his past writings, the first two chapter teasers and the first printings were all signed.After a long wait for my shipping to arrive, the book got to my house safe and sound. I devoured the book in 5 and a half hours straight without a break.(Oh and yes, my copy was gladly signed.)This book is all kinds of wonderfulness mixed together. There's a bunch of witty comments and teenage sarcasm etc in it that will relate to young adult readers but the depth of the book and smartness of it allows readers who are no longer young adults to read it too and enjoy it.Like all John Green books, you always learn and get something out of it (well for me), you learn to see the world in another person's perspective, experience things you'll never experience. You slowly fall in love with all the characters and it's just like you're living and breathing in the story.Do not think of it as a cancer story it is but it's much more than that and ultimately after finishing the book, you walk away with so much.And as John Green wished us to experience, yes I did feel all the things.DFTBA(I'm sorry I'm not the best at reviewing things without being biased. DO give the book a try though, read the sample chapters)"
5,"f nothing else can convince you to read this one, read the blurb from E. Lockhart that's on the back cover: John Green writes incredible, honest truths about the secret, weird hearts of human beings. He makes me laugh and gasp at the beauty of a sentence or the twist of a tale. He is one of the best writers alive and I am seething with envy of his talent.It's about Hazel, a girl who with one cancer medical miracle is granted a little extra time in life, but knows that soon she will die. She meets Augustus, a cancer survivor, in a support group that takes place in a church basement they quickly coin the heart of Jesus for all of the prayers and mention of the name. The book is essentially a love story between these two teens who have already been through so much. They bond over a mutual friend in support group. And they continue to bond over a series of amazing conversations, violent video game playing, and book sharing.Hazel is obsessed with this one book: An Imperial Affliction. And she and Augustus switch favorite books. Hazel gets the series his favorite video game is based off of, and devours several in the series really quickly. And Augustus loves her book too, which ends mid sentence where the main character is assumed to have died of cancer. But both Hazel and Augustus are obsessed with trying to figure out what happens to the other characters in the novel. And the two teens end up going to Amsterdam, spending Augustus' wish (something all cancer kids seem to get and that Hazel wasted on a trip to Disney when she was 13) to go meet the author of An Imperial Affliction and get some answers.There's international adventures, first love, death, survival, philosophical questions, some amazing characters, and a lot of talk about the people cancer patients have relationships with, who they know they will end up leaving behind. There's a scene when the two go to Anne Frank's house and the connections Hazel kept making between herself and Anne Frank, without even realizing she was making the connections, were so scary, and moving.It's not a typical cancer book. It's jam-packed with amazing dialogue, dark and witty humor, and plenty of intense philosophical questions. Why do bad things happen to good people? Why do some people survive and some don't? How can you make your life mean something? Is love worth it even when you know it will end badly? So many of the questions asked in this book are questions you think of adults (way past the stage of mid-life crisis') asking. So, it's really hard reading about kids asking these questions. And these kids are brilliant, real, and so wise beyond their years.I stopped reading all of the other books I was reading to finish this one. Sometimes I'd read a page, or a conversation, and just need to pause and let it all sink in. I slowly savored this book in meaningful and small bites because I didn't want any other food corrupting this flavor.Really, this book is beautiful. And it was capable of putting me in a completely different mindset. It's sad. And I knew it would have a sad ending, so I kind of postponed finishing it.  But, really, I shouldn't have done that because the sad ending was such a beautiful ending. If you like dark humor, YA, John Green, and amazing character development, there is no reason you won't love this one.  Go, read it!"
5," Opening Line:Late in the winter of my seventeenth year, my mother decided that I was depressed, presumably because I rarely left the house, spent quite a lot of time in bed, read the same book over and over, ate infrequently, and devoted quite a bit of my abundant free time to thinking about death.My Take On ItSee that sentence above? That is a shining example of why I include the opening line of every book I review in my post. In that one sentence, we the reader instantly get a feel about our protagonist Hazel, thereby setting the tone of what is to come in this book. Yet, it's not a book about death. Cancer, and how Hazel and the other characters in the book deal with it, plays a role to be sure, but this book isn't just about that either. It is about hope and about life. It's not merely about the business of dying, but the business of living.I have read all of John Green's works, but this is the first review of one of his books I have ever written. Why the wait? Well, he's sort of a tough act to follow isn't he? I used to waitress and tend bar at a comedy club. And I can tell you that no headlining comedian ever appreciated being outshone by his opening act. So, I guess I always felt that there was no way on this sweet earth that I could ever come up with a review that would do justice to the writing of John Green. And I still feel that way.  But I couldn't not say something in response to a book I think one day may be hailed as Green's finest written work.So what is it about John Green? What makes him stand out in the massive sea of authors writing YA literature today? I think it's because no matter whose voice he writes, be it a geeky heartbroken child prodigy with a knack for anagrams; a wayward boarding school student obsessed with the famous last words of people throughout history; the geeky boy next door trying to solve the mysterious disappearance of his neighbor and childhood crush; the awkward boy who tries to act as if he doesn't care but has a larger than life best friend who makes it his mission to prove otherwise; or a seventeen year old terminally ill girl who meets the love of her life in a cancer kids support group she has nearly given up on; no matter whose voice it is, it's authentic. It's someone you or I know, or could know. John Green keeps it REAL.Hazel is the first female protagonist Green has written but I didn't even pick up on that right away. Because it didn't matter. Green can write the voice of a teenage girl just as effortlessly and legitimately as that of a teenage boy. Through his words he can transport a reader into the hearts and minds of his characters.I nodded. I liked Augustus Waters. I really, really, really liked him. I liked the way his story ended with someone else. I liked his voice. I liked that he took existentially fraught free throws. I liked that he was a tenured professor in the Department of Slightly Crooked Smiles with a dual appointment in the Department of Having a Voice That Made My Skin Feel More Like Skin. And I liked that he had two names. I've always liked people with two names, because you get to make up your own mind what you call them. Gus or Augustus? Me, I was always just Hazel, univalent Hazel.And what a cast of character's he creates for us. Hazel, like many of Green's MC's, is the epitome of studious sarcasm. But she's lived so long with her disease it's become all that she is. Until she meets Augustus Waters. What can I say to express the love that I feel for Augustus? Like Tiny Cooper (Will Grayson, Will Grayson) and Hassan Harbish (An Abundance of Katherines), he sort of steals the show. And I am hard pressed to say that I have ever read a more romantic character in a John Green book, or any book for that matter, than Augustus Waters. He seems too good to be true, but then you remember: he's in remission, falling for a dying girl. He doesn't have time for small talk or small sentiments. He is loyal, generous, and kind. And like Hazel, I fell for him too.I'm in love with you, he said quietly.Augustus, I said.I am, he said. He was staring at me, and I could see the corners of his eyes crinkling. I'm in love with you, and I'm not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things. I'm in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, and I am in love with you.Yeah. Holy. Cow.Heartbroken friend and fellow gamer Isaac is also really well written and through him we see other facets of Hazel and Gus' personality. I also loved the inclusion of Hazel's parents in this book. Parental figures don't always play a large role in Green's books, but I absolutely adore Hazel's mom and dad. I'm a mom, and this book hit me hard in that regard. The sacrifices that her parents make to give their daughter as normal a life as possible coupled with the guilt Hazel feels for being such a stress and emotional burden on her parents is heartbreaking. But even in that heartbreak, there are still moments of profound hope and joy and love.So, in closing, John Green has done it again. I loved this book and chose to write about it because it made me laugh out loud. It made me cry my eyes out. I grinned and I swooned. I ran the full gamut of emotions. And I walked away feeling changed. It's not a book about cancer and loss and death. It's a book about life. Read it.5/5 Stars"
5," There are a lot of books out there that make you laugh till you can hardly sit upright, and a lot that drive you to tears. There are far fewer that can do both at the same time. The Fault in Our Stars is just one such book. John Green has managed to create balance where it is sorely needed, walking his characters along the precipice between life and death. This book examines how we live, how we love, and how we die with a strength and grace that is hard to find in this generation of instantly-updated statuses and say-before-you-think approaches to conversation and relationships. This book does not take the careful approach to the subject of death; it takes death in hand, examines it, prods at it, and then crushes it and from the pieces makes something beautiful.Hazel and Augustus are not perfect and each has their flaws; Hazel sometimes becomes a bit of a test for everyone's patience, and Augustus is too overconfident. In the end, though, it is impossible not to fall in love with them. Their joys become your joys, their sorrows your sorrows. You can feel their grief. They are never just their illness, but instantly become people in the minds of the reader.Yes, this is a book about cancer. Yes, this is a book about death, but it is so much more than that. The Fault in Our Stars is a book about living, about finding purpose when purpose seems so futile, when death is inevitable and rushing up at you and grasping at your throat and still being able to look around and say, I want more out of this time I have left. There is a part in this book, about each person having their own infinity of time left to live. I think Hazel and Augustus spent their infinities the best way they could, by loving each other.John Green, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for writing such a beautiful novel.And as always, DFTBA."
5,"f you don't mind having the insane urge to sob for approximately half of the book (which I did), then this is definitely a must read! I'm a consumer of literature and I have to say this truly is an amazing book! It's so honest, and relatable. The characters are so perfect (John Green is FAN-FRICKING-TASTIC) I can't imagine anyone not falling in love with Hazel. She is this witty (very sarcastic) 16 year old who happens to be living with a touch of cancer and crushingly it appears to be terminal...depressing, I know.ANYWAYS...Hazel meets her intellectual &amp; cancer-laden counterpart Augustus Waters. (FOR ME) without him this book wouldn't have worked, because AW is that person you would want to be if you had to deal with being a cancer patient, or really just in general. I want to be on a roller coaster that only goes up too! (READ THE BOOK, it sounds more official when AW says it) As their relationship develops, you the reader will get way too involved, it's just so personal and parts of this book really hurt, I found myself WAY too attached (Yes, even though the author gives the warning in the beginning, about how readers {LIKE ME}  tend to do that, so I'm thinking he's setting you up for failure the whole time, but I digress) It's a star crossed kind of thing, minus that part where they commit suicide and such (Of course they're setup for death naturally so...) I don't want to ruin it for anyone, and It only took me about 4 and a 1/2 hours to read (I COULDN'T STOP, and yeah I tried) BUT... In a Nutshell It's exactly how love should be, (at it's core) honest, hard, and un-ending. All great loves should be something like a Hazel &amp; Gus love, but you'll have to read this lovely book to find all of that out. You won't be let down!!Just remind yourself as you're crying, It's a FICTION, and get some tissues!"
5," Yeah, this one pretty much bowled me over, almost from the get-go.I've read all three of Green's other books, and enjoyed them all in slightly varying degrees, but I can say right up front that this work takes his actual writing, the poetic crafting of his sentences, the unforced gravity and feeling of his ideas, to an entirely different plateau.  I have to admit, in the previous three books, it's sometimes been tempting to write off his characters (especially the male narrators) as unrealistic prodigies, thinly-veiled externalizations of Green's very developed, adult mind into a young adult framework.  In this book, however, both Hazel (Green's refreshing first attempt at a female narrator) and Augustus are amazingly developed.  Their high-concept banter and well-turned inner thoughts come off as honest, engaging reflections, not impositions on believability; they make you have hope for the ability of today's youth to, as Green wonderfully say it, imagine people more complexly. This is even more admirable for the fact that every line and event works towards establishing solid themes of death, loss of self, and the need to matter/leave a legacy for the living.Even just from reading the book jacket, we know how all of this is going to end; into this scenario rife with despair and pain, Green throws in love like a time bomb, and we watch how these characters pass it back and forth, keeping it aloft until the very end; and it's both totally expected and totally devastating whose hands it goes off in.  The characters resist all cliched tropes about love overcoming death, instead using it to propel the living forward into making greater realizations about themselves and their place in the world.  Augustus's letter to van Houten about Hazel at the end of the book is tear-jerking and unmercifully good.This book also seems like it has a smaller focus of characters than the other books, and that's all to the better.  The stuff with Peter van Houten and his assistant is great; I love how Green has no pride in making the only author in the book a slovenly, drunken ass (as if cautioning his fans not to equate love of books with love of their authors).  Isaac is a great character, with all the things that his blindness allows us to explore.  The trophy-smashing scene, making out in Anne Frank's house...all of it with a sheen of hard-won honesty (through revision, I expect) and efficiency; not a word, or thought, is wasted.Just a beautiful book, one that I think could transcend its genre into the classic realm.  Thank you, John Green, and as always...DFTBA!"
5," have named this review as I have as a nod to the characters' struggle to overcome the obstacles that cancer places in the way of their relationship with each other, with their families, and with themselves.  It could also be a description of John Green's success in overcoming self-inflicted wounds in the course of describing the relationship of Hazel and Augustus, 17 year old cancer survivors as we meet them.  The practical knee-knocker is the ability of the kids to embark on international travel to pursue a plot point thanks to the most well-funded, least curious, Make a Wish-type organization known to man.  Augustus calls them the genies and as they provide the assistance of a machina ex dues perhaps this is a good name.  However the biggest obstacle to the suspension of disbelief is the ability of these kids to speak in flowing, existential monologues and dialogues that sound as though they had been crafted, practiced, and examined for days.  No teen - not even preturnaturally bright, only-child, cancer warriors, can talk like this.  So why 5 stars?  Because I fell in love with Augustus and Hazel and cared about them.  Whether or not what they said was authentic for their age, it was authentic for humans in that situation.  They spoke not just of fear and pain and unknowing, but also of questions that we all ask about our purpose and direction and destination.  The characters were in love and so the readers love them too.  Not a technically masterful book but a wonderful read.April 27, 2012.  I have read the book twice more since this review was initially posted.  I am very far past young adult but the characters inhabited my heart again just as they did the first time i read it.  What I said above about the language not being authentic for teens is still correct but what i have decided is that the dialogue is how teens - or at least these teens - should talk."
5," knew going into The Fault in Our Stars that this was going to be one of those books that had me completely raw and broken at the end. Even so, I was not prepared for how thoroughly John Green did this--and I loved every second of it.Hazel Grace Lancaster has been terminal since she was thirteen years old. Whether she would die was never a question; now, with the miracle drug Phalanxifor shrinking her tumors and keeping her cancer under control, the question is when she will die. Hazel's reaction to this is not unreasonable--she sinks into torpor, watches tons of America's Next Top Model, reads her favorite book and waits.Then, she meets Augustus Waters, gorgeous Survivor with a capital S, and slowly but surely, she begins to fall in love.Overall, this story is a beautiful one--life affirming, even, despite the death which hangs over so many of the character's heads throughout the course of the book. The characters are very real and very raw; they are not the stereotypical brave cancer patient that Hazel details at several points in the book. They are brave, for sure, but they are also broken, afraid, lonely, and angry. Not a single character in this book is spared from the harsh reality of the ending--even the non-sufferers are affected, just as is the case in real-life cancer cases. And at the very heart of the story, there is a romance between two doomed children who haven't really had the chance to experience life, and who are determined to do so one way or another. Mixed in with all this bleakness are sparkling moments rather like the titular stars, the hilarious and heartwarming blended smoothly with the darkness and blood and Hazel Lancaster's struggling breaths. John Green has definitely crafted a book for the ages here, and there is not a person in this world that would not benefit from reading it."
2," With THE FAULT IN OUR STARS, John Green goes where angels fear to tread into cancer literature. One gets visions (OK, nightmares) of LOVE STORY and begins to shiver.Fear not, however. This YA novel for ages 9 to 999 (hey, every infinity is different) skirts the treacle with remarkable success. A smash-mouth cancer parable, it hits the Big C from a teenaged point of view, starting in a support group for teens with cancer and ending with an unlikely love dalliance between winsome girl Hazel and charismatic boy Augustus. Beautiful, growing people scarred with ugly, growing diseases.This book is character driven all the way. Voice? In spades. Personality? You'll forget it's a fictional construct. Plot? We'll leave that to the cancer, which has an annoying tendency of unfolding and climaxing with formulaic endings. Still, if all infinities differ, then we ALL have the Big C in some metaphorical sense: call it the Big D as in Date with Death. No wonder our heroes stay at an Amsterdam hotel named after philosophers at one point.Interestingly, Salinger's THE CATCHER IN THE RYE comes up in this book. I say interestingly because Hazel's voice is reminiscent of Phoebe Caulfield's (eight years later and saddled with cancer, that is) -- wise, bittersweet, precocious in many ways. But Hazel is an only child, an extremely sensitive one who worries about what will become of her parents after she dies and worries even more about her coming-like-a-freight-train relationship with Gus, because she is a grenade who will some day (soon) go off, harming those who love her in ways she'd rather not fathom. Worse still, Gus's last girlfriend died of cancer, too. Putting him through it twice, she figures, is reason to retreat. Only love doesn't listen to the language of retreat.Giving the book a quixotic but beautiful subplot is Hazel's obsession with a book and its loose ends. It's author, an alcoholic genius named Van Houten, lives in Amsterdam. When the two use up a wish to travel to the Netherlands and meet this man, unexpected events unfold. Better still, these events, this man's book, and the philosophies beneath it give THE FAULT IN OUR STARS more gravitas still. Again, it reminded me of Holden Caulfield's wish to call up authors he admires, only he never acts on it. Hazel and Gus do. It falls under the be careful what you wish for department.Beautiful book. Into the Pantheon of Great YA Books it goes. And like THE BOOK THIEF, it's one of those YA books that will resonate as much with adults as teens, so click your shopping cart no matter what your age. It was my fate to read it and now I hope it will be yours.See? The stars aren't ALWAYS crossed (Romeo and Juliet notwithstanding...)."
5," Last weekend I started my adventure of another John Green novel. I was so excited and made a post about my reading style for this novel(nice and slow).Friday night I finished this book. I had to finish. I was sitting at a crucial part of the story and just had to know how it ended. There are tons of reviews out there about this book. I have yet to see any who have not enjoyed this book. My goal is try offer something that does not sound like the rest.I have given pause to think about why I like his novels so much. What is it that keeps me coming back to his material? I think it comes down to a few things that are essential.1. His online presence - I look so forward to his videos with his brother. The videos have nothing to do with this books, but you are able to gain a glimpse into the mind of John Green. His rants about Catcher in the Rye or Great Gatsby show how intelligent he is. The videos also provide me a sense of his witty humor which help to bring his words to life when I read them.2. His writing style - is loaded with witty dialogue. He can capture a communication scene between two characters about the most simplest of things and make your head spin. I don't know if everyone enjoys this type of thing, but I live for it. For example(not a spoiler), the discussion in TFIOS about eggs for breakfast is such a clever dialogue scene and one in which I had to stop and think about. Why are eggs considered breakfast? Mindblowing!3. Authentic - is the only word I could think of to describe this final part of his writing, but I feel like there might be a better word out there. John Green does not try too hard to catch his reader off guard or go for the shock factor. He writes real life. This characters come to life on the pages and you cannot help but connect emotions with the characters. It is just a skill he possesses where you feel like his characters are real. He is not writing with a system that so many authors use anymore just to sell books. This book took him a long time to write. Did he rush? No, he took the time to write the story he wanted and it worked.This book was awesome! I did not see a few things coming and when they happened it was only the obvious choice to go, but with my attachment to certain characters I wanted something else. When I finished I realized that my wishes would not have worked.I have about 15 passages marked in my signed copy of the book. I really want to share them, but don't want to risk any spoilers to the reader who has not read or finished the book. However, this book will make it to my bookshelf of keepers along with his others. I have no choice but to go back and read his novels all over again to see what other parts of the stories I have missed.I give this book 5/5. It was the perfect read for me. It brought me back to reading YA and fiction. However, it is hard to find another book to read following this one.If you have not read this book, please do because it is so worth your time. If you have not read John Green, then you are missing out on some amazing characters.Perhaps a book club on this novel is in order? I might have to work on organizing this for an online group.Thank you John Green for making another lasting impression in my life with your stories. I look forward to discussing this book with others in Nerdfighteria."
5," The Fault in Our Stars is absolutely brilliant. It is perfect... Though it may be early to make this claim, it could possibly be my favorite book of the year! It's always difficult for me to write reviews on books that I love this much. I feel that I can never quite do them justice. I will let a quote from The Fault in Our Stars describe it for me:Sometimes, you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book. - The Fault in Our Stars, by John GreenThat's exactly how I feel...  All of us have had our lives touched in some shape or form by cancer. Whether it be watching an actor fight it or a family member, It's not a foreign thing to us. This book is not just about Hazel and Augustus, it's about humanity. Anyone who reads this will be able to find some truth in Green's words. Yes, I have never read any of his previous books... *GASP* I know, crazy right? But this experience has made me contemplate why have let such a gem of a writer go unread for so long... Green's writing is beautiful, poetic, and completely genius!Green wrote about a dark subject and yet maintained some glimmer of hope throughout. While this story did make me cry, it did not devastate me. In fact, it was extremely inspirational. The characters were easy to love, understand, and relate to. I couldn't get enough the playful banter between Hazel and Augustus! Even living on borrowed time, their relationship progressed naturally and developed into a beautiful, deep love.I cannot forget to mention the phenomenal narrator of this audiobook, Kate Rudd. It would have been easy for the narrator to take the emotion too far and overdue it. But not Kate! She portrayed the perfect amount of emotion in every single situation. That narration was so real and believable, that it only added to the beauty of Green's words! She is genuinely talented.The Fault in Our Stars left me with what can only be described as that wow feeling. As readers, you all know what I'm talking about: When you sit silently for awhile after finishing a book because you are so in awe of what you had just experienced. You don't just read or listen to this book, you experience it in the deepest sense... It will make you want to live your life differently! It will change you. And it has certainly set the bar high for the rest of the upcoming YA books this year. The Fault in Our Stars receives my highest recommendation for any reader, regardless of genre!"
5," Kate Rudd did a phenomenal, outstanding job narrating this highly emotional read. Considering the subject matter and the emotionally charged nature of this book, it would have been so easy to overdo the narration. But Kate Rudd's performance was perfection, bringing to life these amazing characters and telling this heart-wrenching story so naturally that it was as if I was listening to Hazels private thoughts. And yes, I could still recognize a great narration even when I don't know how I heard anything over the sobbing mess I was reduced to throughout this book. I highly recommend this audiobook experience to anyone that is interested in reading this book.The story itself, well, I mean its John Green so of course it was amazing. I love this man's writing. It's like he effortlessly creates these wonderfully realistic characters; characters that I'd want to know, that I'd want to become friends with. And by the end of the book, I feel like I DO know them and that we've been friends forever and I'm so emotionally entwined in the story that its actually difficult to move on to another book when it is over. I felt like that with Will Grayson, Will Grayson, and I certainly feel like that with this incredible book.I don't know that there are many of us whose lives have not been touched in some way by cancer, but even if it hasn't, almost everybody has lost a loved one too early and has felt the utter unfairness of that loss. The Fault in Our Stars is the story of several kids suffering from cancer and is told from their perspective. It is unapologetically and brutally honest, morbidly humorous, simply just real. This book was so filled with unfiltered truth that it was almost uncomfortable to read in some places. But I still recommend that you do.By the end of this book, I had cried so many tears that the front of my shirt was wet, and days later I'm still tearing up as I recall the story while I write this review. The Fault in Our stars was a powerful, emotionally intense, and incredibly important read. I highly recommend it to anyone regardless of genre."
5," The Fault in Our Stars John Green's The Fault in Our Stars follows the story of sixteen year-old cancer patient on her quest to have a normal life.  The story deals with not only her own personal tragedy of having cancer, but also the complications of her cancer to those she closest to. Hazel Grace Lancaster has been dealing with cancer for years in her young life.  The cancer has metastasized to her lungs; therefore, an absolute cure is not an option for Hazel.  Yet, Hazel longs for a normal teenager's life, filled love, hope, and freedom.  She finds her first love in Augustus Waters, who is later revealed to have a severe complication of his osteo sarcoma that has spread to essentially all his major organs.  Augustus' tragic death is a major trial for Hazel to get over.  Yet, Augustus' life only meant something because Hazel loved him from his point of view. While Hazel may come off as pessimistic in the book about her cancer, she is absolutely hopeful about the futures of those she loves.  She desires her parents to be able to live normal lives after her passing.  Even though her desire for her mother to have a normal life comes across as ungrateful for her help, it's truly so that Hazel does not have to feel like a burden.  She can visual her parents futures without her as though where they still succeed in life, instead of falling into the pit of despair that is her disease.John Green tells Hazel's story with frank honesty.  Hazel is not a saint just because she has cancer.  She has moments of being a terrible child like all teenagers.  However, the true magic of John Green's story is the passion Hazel has for life.  She wants to live, even if it is a modified version due to her physical limitations, despite knowing death so well.  Her passion extends to not only her life, but the life of those around her.  At one point in the book, Hazel becomes irate with her mother; because she feels that her mother is becoming entirely the care taker of a disease.  Hazel finds great comfort that her mother has started taking courses for master's degree, instead of solely focusing on her disease. Hazel desires freedom.  Her desire for freedom not only from her physical limitations that arise from her cancer, but also the emotional complications that arise due to her disease.  At one point, Hazel is given the opportunity to go to Amersterdam to visit her favorite author with Augustus.  However, some of Hazel's doctors feel that the risk of flying a patient who is on oxygen and is the first successful patient on an experimental drug is too great.  Hazel's physical limitations threaten to stop her from getting the closure she needs to move on from her obsession of her favorite book. John Green's true strength in the books arise the in the blatant honesty that the disease is given to each of the characters.  Some of the characters live, and go onto live normal happy lives.  Yet, would the success stories of some the characters mean anything mean anything without the loss of other characters?  The loss of Augustus reiterates the desire of life for Hazel.  At times, it may seem that the book has lost hope, but it always comes back as in life.  I would recommend this book to anyone who has ever known the real beauty of life arises from the pain that we feel in tragedy and our trials are what shape as individuals.  I would also like warn future viewers that the books mentioned within The Fault in Our Stars are not real books, which is the only real disappointment of the book."
5," tend to be a picky reader and except for my love of all things Stephen King, I tend to read almost exclusively from the non-fiction genre. I fault no one for enjoying other genres, they are just not my thing.My  biggest problem with fiction is that while I know the story is a creation from the mind of a word artist, I want to believe it is real.It has to seem like it could happen. I want to be able to think about the story and see the action going on in my mind. A lot of fiction just fall flat there. The words don't seem like dialogue I would share, and the actions of characters often do not seem like those of anyone I would want to hang out with. Hence, I avoid fake stories.I don't like fake fur, fake eyelashes, or fake emotion either. I want to read a book that matters.The Fault in Ours Stars matters. This story is so real, I could feel it, I could picture it, it surrounded me and it made me cry. This book felt completely authentically written by a teen age girl, and I consider myself an expert on girlness having once been a teen aged girl and now a mother. The two teenagers could have been anyone's son or daughter, and though I am so thankful they were not my children,they were so real, they could have been. I was particularly moved by the parents and their own suffering over the illness of their children, their probable deaths and the heartache only we parents feel when we cannot protect our children. This story is poignant and funny, down to earth and completely enjoyable even when it makes you cry.None of John Green's novels are bad, in fact they are all quite good (though I haven't read Will Grayson, Will Grayson yet), and I mean no insult when I say his books get better, and better each time, but truly, this book is unequivocally his best. It is truly beautiful in its humor, its realism and its pain. I am so glad I read it. I would recommend it to readers of nearly any age because it is everything like real life.On a side note, in an age when young people have some very unrealistic role models- athletes who use steroids, super models who offer impossible body images, celebrities who get married for five minutes or spend more time in rehab than they do their own homes,and politicians who spend more time criticizing each other than they will ever spend on healing our nation. When there is very little encouragement from the world to be yourself, John Green and his brother Hank Green are two men who stand up for all the things that ought to be encouraged. Such as kindness, and being true to yourself, accepting your awesomeness! They are imperfect and successful at what they do. They are outspoken, yet thoughtful, intelligent and weird. Extremely caring about their fans and concerned about the world they live in. I can think of few better role models- they are filled with awesome."
5," Dear John Green,Did you start out writing The Fault in Our Stars hoping to break every reader's heart into tiny-tiny miniscule pieces? I guess it doesn't really matter, but you succeeded John. At least for me and I'm guessing anyone else who picks up your book, they will be emotionally crushed when they close TFiOS after reading the last page.John, fellow Hoosier, I enjoyed an Indiana setting. Even though I live in a part of the state that some people may feel is more a part of Chicago, Illinois than Indiana, I still enjoyed a story written set in my home state.Thank you John, for including those couple of charts/diagrams in TFiOS. In many ways, I think your readers expect to have those or footnotes in your stories. Honestly, I almost wish you would have included more of them...just because you can.John, you are probably the most quotable author I've read. You've probably been told that on numerous occasions, but I figured I would stroke your ego a bit and tell you once again. I won't be sharing my favorites with you today, because I think people need to read your quotes while reading your books, not beforehand.John, I think I love Augustus Waters more than I love Tiny Cooper from Will Grayson, Will Grayson. I always knew Tiny was a character I will never be able to forget, but I just added another character to that list. You made such memorable characters in Hazel and Augustus and I thank you for that. You made me wish I was more like them when I was their age, besides the having cancer of course. I enjoyed the witty banter between the two of them, it made me smile while other parts of the book left me in tears.John, thank you for signing the first printing of The Fault in Our Stars. You are the man! Just a tip: Maybe next time, include a travel size package of tissues. They are a necessity.After you finished writing TFiOS, did you know it was the best novel you've ever written? In my non-expert opinion, it is the best book I've read of yours. I guess I should be honest and say I haven't read Paper Towns yet, and word on the street is that's your best book to some. I hope you win some big kick-ass awards for this book. If you don't, I will be completely ticked-off.John, your book has made a lasting impression on me. I'm sitting her writing you this letter feeling emotionally drained and replaying your words again and again through my mind. I will not soon forget what was written in The Fault in Our Stars.Keep on doing what you're doing because it works,Jacinda"
5," am not a John Green fan. To be honest, it kind of freaked me out that a thirty-four year-old man would write a novel from the perspective of a sixteen-year-old female with a condition he probably does not have. I tossed away Alaska after paragraphs upon paragraphs of romanticized language cultured to make teenage girls swoon. (I was drizzle and she was hurricane-- I mean, come ON.) I'd heard of the release of this novel on Tumblr, where Nerdfighters praised its soon-to-be existence and droned on and on about their excitement. The cover put me off, looking a bit juvenile for my own taste, but alas, the jacket was detached and I was bored at a birthday party and found this book and hastily read the first page.I was immediately drawn in.I'm not sure what it was about this novel, but I knew it was different. Something got to me and my heart and my head that made me confused in every sense of the word. Maybe I was encumbered by strong teenage vocabularies or that the characters were the kind of characters who would make fun of a disabled man because they know he wouldn't be offended by the joke. I felt them and I loved them. It wasn't the kind of character affection that made me want to be Harry, Ron and Hermione, who lived in a world I would not be allowed in. It wasn't Gena Showalter's Oh My Goth, which took place at a regular high school, but made its point with some weird science-fictiony twist (and a devastatingly poor method of analyzing stereotypes). It was not A Raisin In The Sun, which I must say was brilliant, but in a time and place I would never grow up to know. Something about this novel was real and it made me feel things I didn't know I could feel.I can't remember the last time I cried reading a work of fiction or the last time I wanted to pick a book up and read it again. You will cry and laugh and cry again and you will feel angry and sad and mad at the world, and if you're anything like me, you're going to want to cradle this book in your arms and stroke its spine saying, Everything will be okay. You will talk forever about it and you will analyze every word in its string of more words and you will know that everything was meant to be there. I might sound crazy to those who have not read it, but those who have will understand completely.Probably none of that made any sense because I'm still trapped in that mental desolation that you get after reading a good book. That should tell you everything you need to know."
5," This review is just going to be a gush-fest, I know it.John Green is a writer that has yet to disappoint. His words hold more power than any other author's work that I've had the pleasure of reading. I love all of his books, this one taking first place, and recommend them all to anyone willing to listen. The Fault in Our Stars is a hopeful journey, taking a twist that I didn't see coming, and with enough emotion to make anyone feel for these characters.Augustus and Hazel's story is one of my favorites, probably my favorite. And, I must add, I have never before cried so much in a single book, but I knew going into it that I would be crying like a baby.Hazel is living on borrowed time, but she isn't really living. She doesn't have friends, at least not any that understand what she's going through, until she gives a boy with a gorgeous smile a chance. Augustus is a charming and worthy candidate of Hazel. Together they discover so much about themselves and the world around them. Augustus teaches Hazel how to go for things and together they live.I love Augustus' attitude, he was always making me smile. I have so many favorite parts of this book and I feel like everyone should read it and find their own favorites, but I love Augustus. Everything about him makes me grin. He's an amazing amazing person and friend and I hope to one day know someone with his remarkable attitude and witty humor. He and Hazel have this way to talk to each other back and forth that is adorable banter. If for nothing read this book for that.It's the kind of book that makes me want to get up and do something extremely meaningful with my life. I think it will make any reader reevaluate the things they love and those they take for granted. There is so much more to this story and all I want to say is READ IT, read all of John's work because frankly, what have you got to lose?I Love, Love, Love it"
5," Traditionally, I'm not one to conform to pop culture. I like to find books prior to their popularity and treasure them before anyone else has the chance. I considered reading TFIOS before it was popular, but became engaged in another series before I had the chance to catch it prior to it's immense popularity. Recently, I struggled with the indecision to read this novel that was causing widespread dysphoria across the world. I'd seen trailers online, friends had read the book and given spoilers, those same friends were the ones chanting read it, read it every chance they got, I'd heard girls gushing over it going down Campus Walk to and from classes and all of these combined made me shy away from something with such a fan base.With all of this being said, I bought the book on Friday and finished reading it on Saturday morning. I laughed at the light-hearted humor and I cried when I least expected to. In fact, I already knew how it was going to end, thanks to those chanting friends, and told myself that there was no way I was going to cry, but I was wrong. You can't help but cry. It's truly a beautiful story of a love that can never last. Amid all of my reluctance, I enjoyed this book. I won't say that it's 'the best novel of all time' because in my opinion it isn't. However, coming from someone who never expected to read this novel, it's worth a read. Even if you're set on hating it because it's so popular, (just like I was) read it. Just give it a try because John Green has a knack for writing and I believe it should be shared. Don't read it because everyone is doing it, but rather read it for the story and read it for yourself. Don't let your reluctance get in the way of enjoying this novel."
2," With each passing page I read in this book the lump in my throat got bigger and bigger.The Fault in Our Stars is a book I feel privileged to have read and would whole-heartedly recommend for everyone to read.There’s nothing inherently new about the tale being told here. Boy meets girl and falls in love with girl who falls in love with boy despite some very challenging circumstances. Where this book differs from most books out there trying to tell the same story is the way the author – John Green – beautifully captures the voice of the main protagonist, Hazel Grace and makes us FEEL every single high and low moment she suffers as a normal teenage girl but diagnosed with terminal cancer. Augustus Waters a.k.a. Gus, is the very charming and attractive gentleman who captures Hazel's heart. Gus's passion for life is very contagious and it fills every page. I have to say there was a very, very important moment in Amsterdam that really took me by surprise and I had to go back to reread the previous pages. It almost slid under my radar but it was a MOMENT and I feel like the author could have made that moment more impactful as it changed everything. Readers of the book will know what I'm talking about. Maybe it's just me but that moment deserved more bells and whistles... in my humble opinion.You will find many laugh out loud moments plus quite a few ‘Oh No! moments as you read this book. There are many positive and inspiring messages in this book. I think it’s a celebration of life and a celebration of love. I’ll give myself a few months before watching the movie as I'm not yet ready to have Hollywood dilute the experience.A MUST-READ! Please do grab a copy today."
4," listened to this book via audiobook and it was great. The narrarator was perfect for the story. There is an author interview at the end where Green mentions that he recorded an audiobook version for his fans, with him reading it, because some fans wanted to hear him reading it. While I can understand that, I do believe that this book, being told from a female character's point of view, definitely benefited from Kate Rudd being the voice.The story is based on a girl named Hazel, who is terminally ill, and it also features other characters in similar situations, it isn't all tears. That doesn't mean that no tears were shed in listening to Hazel's story. There were more than a few times where I had to suck it up and dry my eyes. Luckily it isn't heavy handed and there were many lighthearted and fun moments.Hazel's character is the most developed, but the others that enter her world are no less worthy of mention. From those friends that only made short appearances to characters such as Gus that became a mainstay in Hazel's world, they were all so well written and so well rounded. No one was perfect, everyone was realistic as a person. This is what made the story feel fuller and true. This could have been someone's autobiography.As an adult, I've never been shy in reading young adult books and this book is a prime example of why. Just because this story features teenagers as the main characters, doesn't mean it isn't a story worthy of being read by people of all ages. It's touching and charming, heartbreaking and delightful, and one not to be missed.Book Received: For free from publisher in exchange for an honest reviewReviewed by Jessica for Book Sake"
5," My sister, Jessalyn, has been talking about this book since basically the beginning of time.  I once borrowed it from her, but I was bad and never actually read it.  I'm horrible at reading print books, it turns out.So, when I saw it was on Amazon for only 99¢, I bought it.  ...but I never got around to reading it - because I had this thing where I was only reading what was expected of me and not what I wanted to read (it's one of my goals for this year)Finally, about a month ago, I'm given a giftcard to audible.  I see it's one of the whisper sync deals, and I buy the audio version.  I am going to freaking finish this book if it kills me!And I absolutely love reading along with audiobooks, so that totally happened.  And it was fabulous.It's a pretty good book, I don't disagree.  But I think I was built up too much, and it was a bit of a disappointment in some aspects.  I did really like how it was able to show that it is okay for characters to not be perfect/healthy/happy people.  For that, I totally appreciated this story.  There are much too many books about that are afraid to use anyone outside of what society views as the norm, and I found this story a sort of relief away from all of that.Also, I totally cried.  I was sitting in my living room listening/reading while my husband was playing Minecraft and my spawn was eating his dinner... and I'm trying hard to hide the fact that there was a large quantity of liquid falling from my eyes.  I failed.  My cats even noticed, and they came over to give me pity cuddles.This is a good book.  I did really enjoy it.  I do someday plan on watching the movie to do a sort of comparison."
5," am on a never-ending quest to find good books for my middle-schooler to read. Reading is my passion, and it has proven more difficult than I ever imagined to engage my 12 year old in reading.  Since he is required to read five books per grading period, I am constantly on the lookout for something to engage him.Although I bought this book for my child, I ended up reading it prior to passing it along.  This was an incredibly thought-provoking book which although the subject matter on the surface is grim (children dying of cancer is tragic, no matter how you look at it), it ended up being a life-affirming book.  I found myself marking passage after passage as my a-ha moments.  Somehow I wanted my children to understand what I had found compelling about this book when it is their turn to read it.The most overwhelming message I took from this book is that we all matter, and we're all important.  Most of us would like to be remembered for some kind of huge, front-page contribution to society, but this book reminds us that every single one of us touches others lives in ways we cannot even imagine.  Just by living, we're creating a legacy for ourselves, and it is our jobs to live well, no matter what the situation.My oldest picked this up last night and said ugh - a love story - no way.  I suggested that it's much more than a love story and that he read fifty pages of it; if he is not interested, forget about it.  My hunch is that he will be compelled to read this through to the end.  I'm looking forward to having some meaningful and substantive discussions with him when he's finished.  Then, it'll be on our shelf until my youngest is old enough to wade into it."
4," After panning John Green's novel Paper Towns, I must make amends by raving about The Fault In Our Stars.  I know that teens are the target audience for the book, but I enjoyed it regardless of my advanced age (although I would have loved this book so much more had I read it as a teen).I'm amazed at how deftly John Green handled elements in the novel that could have turned out mawkish or pseudo-intellectual in lesser hands; the love story works, as does the inclusion of the Peter Van Houten novel, An Imperial Affliction.  I'm currently teaching Tim O'Brien's The Things They Carried to 11th graders and I'm surprised how much that book has in common with John Green's TFIOS:  both deal with mortality and our ways of denying/dealing with death, both novels examine the nature of storytelling and how truth can be approached through fabrication, and both deal unflinchingly with the unpleasant reality of dying.My main quibble with Green's style is how his characters speak either as sitcom characters or grad school philosophy majors, exhibiting a sophistication and self-awareness way beyond their years.  In this novel, this method works; teens with cancer develop would naturally be forced to examine life's meaning and temporality given what they are up against.  Plus, these characters are smarter than average kids (and more literate in the case of Hazel).But enough analyzing - TFIOS works as a full blown romance, the kind that is unembarrassed to dance, shout and make a fool of itself.  Readers can't help being swept up in the love story - the Amsterdam section is brilliant.John Green has created a classic young adult novel - a classic novel, period."
5," bought this book a few months ago, but it took me a while to build up the courage to read it. Reading about cancer is a difficult thing for me to do, as cancer has touched my own life several times and the subject hits pretty close to home. But upon seeing nothing but glowing reviews for The Fault in Our Stars, I knew that I had to read it.Both Hazel and Augustus are fantastic characters - perfectly suited to each other, their personalities are both smart and sarcastic, a combination that I love. Hazel's negativity is sympathetically portrayed - in a girl that isn't living on borrowed time it would be irritating, but for someone that has lived with a spectre over their head for years, it's understandable and refreshing - anyone that lives with a ticking clock would struggle to be positive and sunny all the time.I particularly enjoyed the trip to Amsterdam that they took (the mention of the town that I live in had me tickled pink), because I knew the places they went to and the experiences they had were pretty close to reality. Those trees in autumn really screw with my allergies.John Green writes a simple story, but keeps the focus on the characters and their experiences, both good and bad. The Fault in Our Stars is nothing if not a page turner, and I challenge anyone not to care deeply for the characters, and to keep their emotions in check whilst reading this.As a book about battling cancer, it's not all fun times and puppies, but even the sadder moments are written sympathetically, without being condescending. And although this was a difficult book for me to read, I'm so glad I overcame my fears and took the plunge."
5," think this deserves a five because it truly was an amazing book, filled with thousands of thoughts all crammed into a single story. However, I too now feel like Hazel Grace, wondering what becomes of her (Hazel) and if her cancer eventually kills her soon or far from soon? Does she fall in love again? My questions are endless, but even if I wrote a dozen letters to John Green, I already know he'd probably just sigh and think something like, there is no sequel, there is no ending. I feel as if he wouldn't say something along the lines of, use your imagination, for he seems too.. intelligent? Anyways, I honestly did not shed a tear during this book until.. I won't spoil it, but if you read this, you too will shed a tear at that very spot. I didn't shed a tear because I understood. There are humans, then there are the mutations who seem to have no value to the other's brains, even though we are more valuable than you believe for it to be so. We mutations are the side effects, just as stated in the fine print in Peter Van Houten's hastily words. I am not going to cause you to mope due to well, what I wrote above. Basically, I understand. I understand that the universe needs to be heard and I understand that we all live to believe we will never pass, when each day we're stepping closer to encountering that very Last Good Day. And so, I will leave this review on that note. Read it, not because it's only awesome or heart-touching, instead because you might finally understand some of the world and the life that roams on this planet. Thank you for taking your precious time into reading my essay long review.p.s. don't watch the movie BEFORE you read the book"
5," Everyone was making a big fuss about The Fault in our Stars. I read the Amazon synopsis. It’s about kids with cancer. So I was expecting something lighthearted, right? Well it was quite a bit more lighthearted than I thought it would be. But still. I think it may have surpassed the famed 1996 reading of Where the Red Fern Grows for “most tears making it out of eyes.” But it also inspired more actual laughter than anything else I have encountered by myself in my new studio. It may be a very sad book, but it is the perfect vehicle for the philosophical insights John Green weaves into both story and text.I am always wary of books written by middle-aged men told from the point of view of a young girl. John Green did an excellent job. There were some phrases which I didn’t think a 16 year old girl would really say, but some of that may be a regional dialect I’m not familiar with. Also the first person did not bother me as much as it usually does, say in The Hunger Games. I don’t know if I could just relate to Hazel more than I did to Katniss or if John Green’s writing was just more what I’m used to (i.e. academic) so the first person was less jolting. But either way, the first person just blended into the story and didn’t bother me.Read this book. But read it alone. The emotions I experienced were not proper for displaying on public transportation or a coffee shop. You’ll want to experience the emotions, not suppress them. It was worth it. Feel ALL THE THINGS. But perhaps you won’t want people interrupting the flow of the story to ask why you’re crying or sniggering. Maybe you will. It would be good publicity for The Fault in Our Stars, I guess."
5," Okay is a reference to this more than okay love story and not the quality of the story. The story is actually a beautiful one. I became caught up in it's subtlety and isn't it as most love stories happen...girl meets boy, boy stares at girl, boy and girl fall in love. Only these characters aren't regular...far from it.Both Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters have cancer (at least some form of it at various times) who meet at a support group. Their spheres of living are small and they are drawn to each other. One reviewer marked that they aren't like regular teenagers and they're right. It is easy to get lost in the venacular just like it was back when Dawson's Creek first started but even that becomes easy to forget as you become more deeply invested in these characters individually and as a couple.I thought I would easily finish this book without shedding one tear but I was completely wrong!! Love and death demand emotion and emotion is what this book gave me. The sadness of tragedy and loss; knowing that we are all grenades waiting to go off, planets ready to explode.I finished the book wanting these two characters to be real and I'm so glad the author did not end the way An Imperial Affliction ended!! I would have written the author, much like Hazel did demanding answers!Now, I ask myself what book can follow this one? It's the type of book that needs a couple of days to get over the pain; to let my heart mend before starting another journey with new characters who aren't Augustus and Hazel.This is a wonderful, heart rending book about sickness, life, loss and love. The only way after this book is UP."
5," Perhaps it's just me, though the main focus being a teenaged cancer patient leads me to think otherwise, but I did a lot of crying toward the end of this book.  That is not, in any way, a shortfall - I think that when words on a page can move a person to tears, it's a pretty resounding endorsement of said words on said pages.  I'd be remiss if I forgot to mention that I did a lot of laughing as well.After a long reading dry spell I thought this book would be a good way to ease back into literature.  It sure was - a moving story, real characters, plot twists, hope, honesty, young love, sarcasm, and a whole lot of end-of-life coping, it really had it all.  I breezed through the story in two days and spent another day or so recuperating.The story focuses on two teenagers, Hazel who has cancer, and Augustus who is in remission.  They meet in a support group and spark a friendship immediately.  The plot follows the two in their changing relationship with one another, the progression of their diseases, and a bit of an offshoot about Hazel's favorite book and its writer.  The characters aren't completely believable at first, but I had to remind myself that we find them in extreme circumstances.  Immediately upon reading the book I found myself thinking, I sure wasn't like this when I was 16.  To which I immediately retorted, obviously.  They are living a reality that very few do and are therefore extraordinary people.  Wise beyond their years.I read this book when I was 23 years-old but can see it being enjoyed by anyone from (a mature) 13 to 102 years of age.  I urge you to laugh and cry as, certainly, every other reader has."
2,"f you have  not already, click the buy button immediately, head to Barnes and Noble, or run to your nearest library PRONTO, ASAP, whatever other synonyms for those words.John Green. This book deserves more than five stars, more than infinity stars for the matter. I can't. I just can't. I don't even know where to begin.Generally, when you think of a cancer book, or any other book where a tragic illness is acquired, you think, “ Oh my God, this is Fitz going to be one of those depressing books where they just don't get better ans they're just going to die and I'm going to be a crying mess on the floor while my parents look at me like there's something wrong with me or that I need psychological help. Yes, and no.No, this wasn't depressing. Yes, one of the characters doesn't get better and eventually dies. And yes, I did get teary-eyed and almost break down on the ground. But I think this cancer book is freaking spectacular and not at all depressing. But I have to admit: at the end of the book, it felt incomplete. But I think that that was the point. In the novel, they refer to An Imperial Affiliation a lot. And they talk about how the novel just ends, mid-sentence. TFIOS doesn't end mid-sentence, but at the end, j felt myself wondering what happened to the other characters, just like Augustus and Hazel had.TFIOS has everything {and more, actually} that every good story needs: Humor, Love and Romance, Conflict, and a little bit of tragedy and death. All in all, point of this review is that you need to go read it. And if you don't like it...I don't know what to say to you because you SHOULD like it. Enough said."
5," approach heavily hyped books (particularly in the YA genre) with not just great caution, but nearly an expectation that it could never live up to it. That being said, I do keep an open mind and like to judge things for myself, which is how I was happily proven wrong about the most talked-about book of 2012, The Fault in Our Stars by John Green. Really, Time Magazine? I thought. #1 book of the year? Well, I wouldn't go that far but this really is a case where you should believe the hype. It certainly would have made my Top Ten list had I read it in time.The book is done a disservice by its generic plot summary about two cancer-ridden kids who fall in love and examine their lives, come to terms with dying, etc. Yes, that's been done a million times, and I too was afraid this book would just be another rehash of that so-called emotional journey. Green surprised me by taking Hazel and Augustus on a quite literal journey to track down the elusive author of her favorite book instead. It's part dying-wish, part youthful-curiosity, and the globe-trotting result is unexpected, exciting, romantic, tragic and meaingful.The Fault in Our Stars is set in what I like to refer to as hyper-reality. Its characters - especially for being teenagers - are just a little too charismatic, a little too confident, wise, quick-witted and funny to remind the reader of the imperfect humans we encounter in real life, but they do fit perfectly into their own reality, which Green still manages to use to great effect to illustrate truths about our own. And yes, there will be tears. Buckets of them. This is still a book about two kids with cancer, after all."
5," The Fault in Our Stars is an intriguing book, its telling an odd mix of pretentiousness and mundanity that doesn't always mesh.  Hazel Lancaster is the narrator, a seventeen-year-old living with cancer, whose last three years have been spent at home, with her only interaction being a support group for other teens with cancer.  It is at one of those meetings that she encounters Augustus Waters and once that has happened, her life will never be the same.For three years Hazel has stayed home, the oxygen tank she is forced to use her constant companion.  During that time she completes high school and attends a few classes at the local college, but Hazel is almost entirely without friends, for her life can't be normal like other teenagers.  Meeting Augustus is like a whirlwind, for he falls for Hazel and lets her know how he feels unabashedly.  Hazel is completely resistant to a romantic relationship but open to friendship, and the two bond over the book that Hazel loves and rereads constantly.  When Augustus decides to use his Wish to help Hazel meet her favorite author, the two teenagers are taken on a journey where Hazel finally confronts how she feels about Gus and what it means to open oneself up to losing someone.John Green's novel is generally well-written and compelling, but I found the pages-long descriptions of a video game being played were odd, especially when paired with fierce verbal wordplay from the two uber-smart main characters.  As I said, it doesn't always mesh.  All in all, The Fault in Our Stars is a truly heartbreaking work, one that is hard to put down and even harder to forget."
5," Let me start off by saying I was very excited to read this––I had heard wonderful things, as I'm sure most people did. However, as I read on and on, I found myself wildly disappointed.I never felt connected/emotionally vested in Hazel. I couldn't get past the horrific dialogue amongst the characters and felt Green really missed the mark when it came to getting inside a 16-year-old girl's head. From Hazel's narration, to her interaction with her parents, to the banter between her and Gus, I literally found myself cringing while reading. Green's attempt to capture a teenager's world was like a Dad doing a bad impression of their own kid. But you can't really blame him. You have a thirty-something-old dude writing as if he was a young girl. With cancer. I wasn't buyin' it.While there were some nuggets of interest peppered throughout, overall I was just so let down. I felt he was almost trying TOO hard to be sad. All my friends think I'm crazy for not liking it (I tried!) but I feel the need to  voice my utter disappointment in this book."
4," **SPOILER**I recently had just finished reading the novel The Fault in Our Stars by John Green. Contrary to common opinions, I did not enjoy it at all. Reading was never my favorite hobby. But, if a book is constantly mentioned on how amazing it is, I always try and venture out to read it. The hype that was built up around The Fault in Our Stars was not all it was cracked up to be…for me at least. I think the biggest disappointment of reading this story for me was that it was so typical. Hazel Grace, the main character, was a quirky, cute, intellectual, girly, sarcastic, and cultured teenage girl. She had the perfect balance of everything…which made me dislike her. Her boyfriend, Augustus Waters, was depicted as every girl’s dream guy. He was the cool, popular kid in every high school. It was a continuous theme throughout the book of Augustus being so handsome and him having the best personality. The two together made the perfect couple, which would be so predictable if you had just read the summary on the inside cover. They were almost too perfect, except for the fact that they had cancer. But, Green did not execute the truth behind the disease and how crippling it can be. Instead, he made it seem like Hazel Grace’s oxygen tank was kind of cool. This is not the first book to explore the cancer theme, and I feel like Green did not fill the story with the emotion cancer brings with itself. Cancer is nothing like what it is depicted in The Fault in Our Stars. It does not give you the love of your life or amazing opportunities to take trips around the world. Maybe Green was trying to highlight the characters’ personalities over their illnesses. But, what really happened was that everybody in this book was defined by their illness. This book just did not do justice for me. Maybe it is because I have high expectations for really popular books and I perceive them to be interesting and unlike anything I have ever read. The Fault in Our Stars just sounded like any other love story, only it did not have the usual happy ending. But as I stated before, it was predictable. I could already tell that Augustus was going to pass away right from the first part where he is mentioned. Ultimately, I would not recommend this book if you are not a fan of love stories. Or, if you enjoy reading books with plot twists"
2," TFIOS was great book! Excellent to read with a loved one, conjured up a holt lot of emotions. Great work John Green!"
2," love John Green. He's one of my favorite authors. I heard a lot of good reviews because of this book but I really don't like this book at all. I sometimes force myself to read a chapter because it's that bad. The ending is so predictable I see no reason as to why even finishing the book. I love Looking For Alaska and Will Grayson, Will Grayson but this book was definitely not for me and I honestly think it's quite horrible."
5," This is my first book by John Green and I'm quite disappointed. I knew from the very beginning I wouldn't like it, but I decided to finish it anyway. It's another tear-jerking love story, except I didn't feel like crying at all. I knew from the minute they introduced Hazel and Gus how the plot would play out. The characters are unbelievable - yes, there are smart and witty kids out there, but Hazel and Augustus (what's up with his name, seriously) are so contradictory -  their speech is pretentious all the time, but then there is also an abundance of likes and whatevers (too many if you ask me) that come from Hazel on every page. I'm just tired of all these love stories about awkward underdog girls (who, of course, don't realize they are attractive) meeting a handsome prince who falls in love with them right away -c'mon!!! (Twilight and 50 Shades of Grey had the same story line, right?). Maybe if I was 15 I would have loved this book because it would have made me believe there is a sexy boy with a pretentious name waiting to fall in love with me, but I don't see how an adult can take this seriously."
2," Perhaps I would have enjoyed this book if it hadn't been so similar to one of the story lines in My Sister's Keeper.  Because of that, I was comparing the two...and this was the one that fell very short.I have to say that while I'm happy for the author, I'm surprised at the high reviews for this novel."
5," got this book under the impression that it was a good read due to the numerous good reviews it received. How wrong I was. The characters were so unrealistic and used language that kids that age would never use. I felt like the love between Hazel and Augustus was like puppy love and a bit rushed. I also did not like the fact that the author put down other cancer books and congratulated himself on making a successful one. So unless you're a twelve-year-old girl, do not waste your time on getting this book."
2," You have a choice in this world, I believe, about how to tell sad stories, and we made the funny choice.Did you know that there are, chemically speaking, two different stages of love? The first stage, the one where you're falling and all dopey and basically unable to function because you can't think of anything but that other person is the result of a chemical cocktail of adrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin pouring through your brain. The second stage, the one where you're committed and stay together potentially for life is because of two other chemicals, vasopressin and oxytocin. These are the ones that really bond you together, but the fact is, once you're getting the vasopressin and oxytocin, you don't get so much of the adrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin. And that, my friends, is probably the biggest reason that I (and quite probably you) love to read about falling in love. It gives me a bit of those chemicals (and feelings) back. That's why after reading a book I love, I often can't sleep, and I usually have a lot of energy. And I love it!But here's the thing. Reading can also make you feel not-so-good feelings that you don't like and want to avoid like the plague. That, my friends, is why I did not really want to read The Fault in Our Stars. I drug my feet...a lot. Even while reading. A book that could have easily been read in one sitting, I read a third of, put down for two days, then read chapter by chapter for some time, getting up and doing something else constantly to try to keep myself from getting too involved. This behavior continued for about 2/3 of the book. I knew what was coming, and I dreaded it. I kind of Monnicad this book. I didn't want to get hurt, so I pushed it away, but it hurt anyway. But it also felt pretty good, falling in love with Augustus Waters.This book doesn't really need another review at this point. Many/most of you have already read it, and to my knowledge, everyone's loved it, so it seems silly to go on and on, and yet I'm not sure I can resist fawning a little. So here it goes:I love Augustus. I love that he pushes this perfect boundary between being pushy and just plain attentive. I love that he doesn't try to kiss Hazel, or call her too much, and I love that he reads her favorite book first thing, and really thinks about it.I love that Hazel has a hard time standing much, and Augustus has a hard time sitting. Something about that whispers star-crossed lovers in your ear and breaks your heart.I love that Hazel and Augustus both have wonderful families. Families who care about them and support them, and even hover a little, but the kids don't resent them for it. They love them for it. There need to be more families like this in books (and maybe in real life).I love that this book manages to include poetry that wasn't at all cheesy, and did not once make me gag.I love that this book made me laugh a lot more than it made me cry. I agree with Hazel and Augustus (and with Mr. John Green), you have a choice how to tell sad stories, and the funny choice? That's the best one.And I like my choices."
2," knew when I preordered this book more than six months ago that it would be great. All of Green's books are. I was not prepared, physically, emotionally, or psychologically for just how good this book was going to be. Good isn't a word that describes it, it's not powerful enough- stupendous nearly covers it. I had heard John read the first chapter last summer, but I shied away from the more recent readings or previews because I wanted to be a clean slate for reading the first time. My husband and I ordered one copy for the two of us, and only now realise how big of a mistake that was. I gave my husband first dibs on reading it, as I had gotten to read Maureen Johnson't The Name of the Star first. He's a school-teacher and began reading it after he got off work. He had finished by the time we went to bed. It's a really fast read, nearly impossible to put down. Your heart breaks when Esther's does, the way Green describes Amsterdam is so fantastic, you feel as though you are there and can see and smell what the characters are seeing and smelling. The book takes you through an entire spectrum of human emotions, and I'll admit I cried like a little girl. Several times. This is a book about a person going through cancer, not a cliche cancer book. There is nothing cliche about this book. The way Green describes the existential crises the characters go through make you re-evaluate your entire way of life. I've never read a book that has changed me (for the better) like The Fault in Our Stars has. I want to buy extra copies so I can give one to my future children, grandchildren, nieces, and nephews. To be perfectly honest, I don't know if there is any way to improve the written word. I don't know what Green will do next. I don't know if there is any way to write a better book. I will continue to read other works of fiction, but I doubt seriously that I will ever find a book better than this."
5, This book made me laugh. it made me cry. it made me want to tell everyone in my life i love them. this is a wonderful book for anyone over the age of 10. Warning: this does contain some mature themes.
5," Great books, or any form of a great story (for that matter) can make you cry and laugh. One that surpasses this level of greatness can make you laugh while you're crying, or vice versa. The Fault In Our Stars is that kind of book.There was never a doubt in my mind about whether I'd like this book. I mean, this is John freaking Green (although I'm pretty sure that isn't actually his middle name). Plus, Paper Towns is my favorite book (ever). So when my copy arrived yesterday, I dropped my book bag by the door, forgetting the review book that I was so close to finishing, or the homework assignments I had, because I needed to know just HOW good The Fault In Our Stars was.Let me tell you. It. Is. Brilliant. Paper Towns is still my favorite book from John Green (and my favorite in general), but this is his best book yet. He has these characters that you have to love, whether it's because of their clever observations of life, or the way they handle their day to day living with having to be declared or see as: THAT cancer girl or guy. As though that is all they will ever be remembered for (if at all). And this type of life or story would be terribly depressing if it weren't for the quirky, sarcastic wit that almost every character in some form or fashion seems to have. This is why I could start laughing in the middle of my tear fest, or randomly start crying in the middle of a laughing fit.And the thing is, there are obvious signs that show when I know a book is excellent. When I'm reading this kind of book, all the situations and problems I have momentarily fall away. And for that day or two, there's a type of peace. Oh yea, and I either hug the book to my chest and smile a lot, or I have to make a note of all the awesome quotes I have to return to as soon as I finish the book.There's a lot more to be said about this book, or how it makes me feel. Like how these characters are the most perfect imperfect characters I've ever met, or that I might (also) have fallen for Augustus. But that's not the point, because I've already read it, and it has made a huge mark (not a scar) in my life. The point is that YOU need to read it. No book is for everyone, but I have no doubt that this one will be enjoyed by a multitude.Additional note: I loved the book, but here are three distinctive things (other than the characters) that I really loved-  The parts that were (clearly) inspired by The Great Gatsby-  The poetry-  An Imperial Affliction (which needs to be made into a real book... I'm just sayin"
5," John wrote this in such a way that you don't notice you're crying until you're sobbing. The Fault in Out Stars is a book you can't help but fall in love with, with characters that become friends the instant you read them. I would recommend this book to everyone."
5," Am I allowed to give this a 10/5?I had to let TFiOS sit around in my brain over 24 hours before I could form a coherent post. I'm a John Green fan, but it took me forever to get around to reading this. I'm glad it took me awhile because I was able to see the reactions from others and think, oh, come on...it can't really be THAT good. It IS THAT good.I'm a masochist for sad storylines. TFiOS is told from the POV of 16 Y/O Hazel, a cancer patient who is in terribly poor condition. Her parents urge her to attend a local support group as a way to make friends. At one particular meeting, Hazel meets Augustus Waters. Augustus lost a leg due to a previous bout with cancer, but seemed otherwise healthy. As would be expected-the two fall in love. --That wasn't a spoiler...come on.Without giving away too much, I will say that TFiOS is heartbreaking, hilarious, and still shows a realistic view of what cancer does to the body. Hazel and Gus are both terribly optimistic given their circumstances. Their friend Isaac is also usually optimistic and frequently makes jokes at his own expense. What else are they supposed to do?But it is the ending. And some of the things that are said. ....but mostly that ending. Like I said, it took me a day to let the book boil over in my mind, but I'm still a blubbering mess just thinking about it. I highly recommend it to any late comers such as myself who may have not jumped on the train already. A movie is in the works and Hazel has already been cast, but I still want to nominate myself for the role...you know, just in case the actress has something come up and has to quit?"
5," WOW this book is phenomenal. It was well-developed, heart wrenching, and utteringly beautiful. I loved the morbid humor and the beautiful love story that has a bittersweet ending. This book shows a perfect concept of the way people with cancer think and feel. It brings up many things such as sick people getting preferential treatment, getting treated like they aren't normal, and it shows just how normal and human they are. The characters in this book were awesome. They fight and cry and live better than any nonsick person and they do it with a morbid sense of humor. This book had me riveted from the very first chapter and it had me bawling by the end. Get ready for a roller coaster of emotion if you read this book.This book is about a 16 year old girl named Hazel that has lung cancer. While at a Support Group she meets her boyfriend Augustus Waters. He is charming, funny, smart, and good-looking. He is there supporting his friend Isaac. Hazel and Augustus become close so fast but instead of turning me off to the story like this usually would Green does it in a way that makes it believable. These kids are dying or are survivors of disease. They are not going to take anything in life for granted. So the fast paced romance makes sense.I love Hazel and Augustus' characters. They were beautifully and tragically written. I loved their humor, their view of life as they talked about wanting the universe to notice them. I loved their bittersweet love and romance. I love how charming and funny Augustus is. I wish I had a boyfriend like him. I find Hazel a perfect match for him. She is witty, smart, and has the same sense of humor."
5," Like other reviewers, I have to comment on the language used by the characters in this book. As a reader of sci-fi and fantasy, it's not normally difficult for me to suspend my disbelief for the pleasure of reading. In fact I welcome the opportunity to do so. It's not that there aren't intelligent, articulate teenagers in the world, and the two lead characters in this book were exceptional and it is totally acceptable for them to have an expansive vocabulary. The real problem is, only pretentious jerks saturate every sentence with million dollar words (and believe me this book is dripping with them). So I struggled with the inconsistency of the characterization. Were these kids pretentious jerks (and, if so, how could I like them). Ultimately, I decided that Green just got in his own way here. It was difficult to ignore the presence of the author and therefore impossible to fully connect to the characters. I didn't even cry when I certainly should have.On a brighter note, there were some truly dark and beautiful ideas here and I enjoyed the philosophical musings of the characters. The language itself was fantastic and I was pleased to see so many words that aren't usually present in young adult novels. Unfortunately, it was just too much and presented in the wrong way. In my opinion, Green should have toned it down a little, perhaps allowing only a single character to be the pretentious jerk. (Instead ALL of the characters, yes ALL, speak as if they have a masters degree in philosophy).The Fault in Our Stars is a quick and easy read so if you want to find out what all the hype is about I say go ahead and read it."
5," A breathless emotional roller coaster that hooked me in the moment I read the first page. This is hard to review. Not because it is not worthy of a review...look at my rating and that tells you it is. It is just hard because for starters I am not a reviewer, nor a writer, but I can just plain and simply let folks know if I like something or not. Okay, so when I was on page 136 I posted on twitter to @realjohngreen that the book was awesome and again I posted when I was on page 177 that I wish my lunch hour had not ended because I just had to know. Then on to Chapter 20, I was in a car dealership waiting room surrounded by men. Not the best place to be when reading a book such as this. Fighting the tears in my eyes I had to close the book, text my daughter of my current emotional state and wait patiently until I arrived home where I quickly snuggled up with Kleenex in hand and finished the story. At each of those moments I was excited, anxious and worried. When I say it was an emotional roller coaster, I mean it. I was happy, sad, and angry, worried, and perplexed...everything. There were moments when I connected with Hazel as I do with my own daughter and that warmed me. There were times I imagined that I was Hazel (don't tell my husband) only to be in the presence of hot hunky Augustus (Gus); even with his notorious dangling cigarettes. And there were times that I can only pray not to be in the shoes of any of them, for then I would not know the pain and loss, yet I know as well as everyone else that eventually we all end up...This is a gripping, tearful, beautiful with some genuine humor, love story about living! A must read."
5," downloaded The Fault in Our Stars on my kindle over a year ago and every time I would start to read it I would think to myself, this is going to be a depressing cry-fest and I just cannot handle that right now, and then I would put it away and start some other novel without cancer and teenagers and star-crossed loves.Having finally finished reading it (and at the beach no less) I've come to the conclusion that I really should't have kept putting it off.Yes it is sad, it is totally heartbreaking, but it is also funny and profound and incredibly sincere. The kind of  deep and thought provoking fare that you don't always see in YA fiction.John Green writes from Hazel's perspective and for a grown man, he certainly seems to capture the voice of a teenage girl living with terminal cancer. In fact, I believe he was inspired to write the novel by a girl very much like his Hazel. He doesn't glorify death or sugarcoat cancer. He writes from a very real perspective that anyone who has been touched by death can appreciate.Hazel and Gus are teenagers who are not teenagers. They've been dealing with the realities of cancer and side-effects of dying for so long now that they are more than teenagers and more than adults. They are the ones who face their own mortality every day. And, in the face of death, they fall in love.In the end it is a novel about death, but it is also a book about life and I will recommend it to anyone I talk to now. I'm probably one of the last on this bandwagon now, but Augustus and Hazel will occupy my thoughts long after I've written this review."
2," am a bestselling writer myself in a different genre and it is not often I write a review. The hardcover version of this book had been long been sitting on a shelf in my house after one of my daughters read it a few years ago. Though I normally don't read young adult novels, I finally decided to give it a go because I wanted to read it before seeing the movie.Let me tell you, I devoured it one day. I cried big ugly tears from the very first word to the very last word. Hazel and Augustus's love story is one that will stay in my heart forever. I loved the sparse, witty writing and the intelligent dialogue. There is only one word to describe this book-- beautiful.I saw the movie the following day and thought I'd bawl all over again from start to finish. Interestingly, I didn't. While I enjoyed the movie very much (and especially the casting of Hazel and Augustus), I only cried at the end. It didn't capture me as much emotionally as did John Green's exquisite words. Coming from an entertainment background, I understood why some creative choices were made, but some memorable scenes were deleted as well as some amazing lines like Time is a slut. It screws with you as well as the star gazing scene which gives the book its Shakespearian inspired title. And the reason Augustus was attracted to Hazel in the first place was significant and moving too but omitted in the screenplay.Read this book! And before you see the movie! Have a roll of Bounty paper towels nearby. It is one of the best books I've ever read. And I hope you will feel the same way. Thank you, John Green, for the gift of your writing."
5," Before I read this book, I wasn't sure if it would be for me. I like young adult, but it's not a genre I actively seek out.Unless you've been living in a cave, you've probably heard about this book. It's the story of a teenage girl, Hazel, who is terminally ill with cancer. While at a support group for people suffering with cancer, she meets Augustus, who is in remission, and so the love affair begins.Hazel isn't self-pitying about her disease. All she's trying to do is live her life, respond to her emotions, and make the most out of the time she has left. It's this attitude that makes her life so engaging.Hazel's love interest, Augustus (Gus), is witty and eloquent. At points I found him a little too eloquent and borderline pretentious, but those moments were fleeting. On the whole I loved him and his role in the story.Getting to know these characters and see their love grow was a pleasure. Green manages to negotiate teenage love without making it feel like an over-emotional mess. It was well handled and captivating to read. This made the sad scenes all the more heartbreaking.While reading this book, I felt so close to the action I could smell cancer and everything associated with it. The treatments, the hospitals, the drugs...To avoid spoilers I won't take my review any further.John Green is an amazing author, with a wonderful prose style. Incredibly conscious writing makes for an easy read, but a well crafted one.This is a great book and one I would recommend to anyone. It's funny, heart breaking, and incredibly well told."
5," One of the problems with reading mostly literary fiction is that I tend to miss out on some great books simply because they don't show up in my recommendations lists on various websites. Every December, I scour the Top Books of 2012 lists and compile a list of top picks that catch my interest and try to play catch up. This year is no different, and so far I have added The Round House, The End of Your Life Book Club and The Fault In Our Stars (feel free to add your recommendations in the comments section below).Upon the recommendation of my sister, I opted to read The Fault In Our Stars by John Green first (apparently he is considered a voice of our generation and has a popular YouTube channel, but I didn't know that until this week). Now, I read a lot of good books, but I don't often stumble across one that captures my attention to the point that I forget about the outside world. This book did just that, and I highly recommend it. Narrated by a terminally ill teenage girl, it tells a poignant story of life, love and loss. It is written in a conversational tone, and the reader rides the ups and downs of cancer and normal teenage problems with the narrator. This book demonstrates a wide range of emotions and I laughed, cried and got mad right along with the main characters.I don't typically read, never mind like, young adult books, but this one was a rare exception. I can understand why it made every Top Books list and recommend it to both teens and adults. Thanks to my sister for vouching for it, because without her I would have skipped over it!For more reviews, visit [...]"
5," Words cannot describe how amazing this book is. But I will try. This is the second John Green book I've read and I was not let down.The book is believable and catching. It draws you in so that all you can do is sit there until the book is finished. I like how even though the plot seems simple - perhaps boring - in of itself (cancer girl finds love with a cancer boy), the story and writing is so well done that you can't put the book down. The characters are relate-able (at least in my opinion). I loved Augustus the most. He cracked me up even till the end.I love how John Green had hilarious scenes and then would put in one or two sentences of deep and thought provoking ideas. This is the type of book that makes you think. And while I'm not always a fan of those, I love how John Green works it into his stories.While the story is a love story it has both its happy and sad moments. And I enjoyed that emotional roller coaster. I stayed up till four in the morning finishing the book. And then immediately afterward I called my boyfriend to tell him how much he means to me. Yes I cried while reading this book - as did probably many others who read it. I cried because I could see myself in the shoes of the characters. I could picture the heartbreak and it felt real to me at times. I was probably reading through teary eyes for the last 50 or so pages.It is an amazing book about life, love, loss and hope. I highly recommend it to teens, young adults and adults. It is definitely a book I'll pick up and read again when I'm in the mood for a sad and yet happy love story."
4," Upon ordering this I was excited; being a Tumblr user this book has been all over Tumblr for weeks. People Obviously thought this book was good so naturally, I was curious. I expected some kind of logical self-esteem kind of book.. I never bothered to look what it was about. I wanted it to be a mystery.Upon arrival I opened the package up with two other books neatly tucked inside. Nothing was damaged or broken. Everything was perfect. It took me several days to pick up the book and actually read it. I didn't want to loose that mystery vibe but at the same time the cover and name and everything I had seen looked so interesting that I eventually (with a week) had to pick it up to see what all the fuss was about.Upon reading I was opened to this new kind of book. Something I didn't  expect. A girl with cancer? Throughout the book I laughed, cried, and mourned the end of a perfectly written book. I felt like the story ended beautifully; but because I am a woman who loves beginnings more than endings.. I went back to read the first few chapters. I soon found myself in this brave young girl. I could relate to her on a level.. then I came to realize. Isn't that how we read books? We relate to that person some how and because of that we are drawn to reading the book about them.. well, it makes sense to me.This is at the top of my recommendations list. The author deserves to be applauded. He writes so beautifully that it is hard to imagine that I could ever find a book that could top that one.Good luck Readers.~Keep Reading.Ash~"
5," Oh, John Green. You really need to stop making me fall in love with your characters.The Fault in Our Stars is as depressing, heart-wrenching, lovely, wonderful, and well-thought as I'd imagined it would be. Hazel and the supported cast of characters combine to make a horrible situation, albeit one that's been written about before, into something unique and not entirely hopeless. While not everyone will get what they're looking for if someone's searching for a perfect plot or ending, I think every bit of this fit in perfectly.First off, I have to say that the characters made it what it was. Augustus, Isaac, and Hazel were definitely my favorites, but I also loved all of the parents, those random characters that popped in for two sentences, Isaac's little brother (and I can't remember his name). Each had their own quirks, exaggerated features, personal hopes and shortcomings and flaws. No one was perfect. Thankfully. They were as real as a reader can hope to get.While at some times I had no idea where the plot was going or what was going to happen next, I didn't really care. I just wanted to learn more about this budding friendship, about Hazel's health problems, and what life could bring her. There's no sweetening of the details here, or brushing over of the more technical or depressing parts. I liked how the reader is there with her through thick and thin.If you want to read this, don't bother trying to prepare yourself. Dive right into it, and let it take you on a ride you'll never forget.DEVASTATINGLY DELIGHTFUL. 5/5 stars"
5," First off.It was a quick read.I finished it within a 24 hour period of time. Granted, I'm an adult reading YA fiction. It's not Dostoevsky ( I spent a few summers trying to get through long winded Russian on my down time ) but it still kept my attention enough that I wanted to see it to the end.My predictions were right.Hazel &amp; Gus had their own fatal flaws and demise with all the typical character traits these sort of books have. The heroine doesn't know her own beauty...etc. You discussed it all above and I agree. ( yada yada yada )There was a third character though.Cancer. And I think, this was the one, that I wanted to shy a way from.It's a dirty word in everyone's language throughout the world. It signifies pain and suffering no matter the language spoken. And for some of us it hits close to home.I myself have spent much time laying in a hospital bed ( for my Crohn's ) as well as sat by my mother's bedside as she lost her battle to cancer. It is not pretty. It is raw and ugly but this book did show that their can be beautiful moments in that suffering.There is some romanticization of cancer within this book but I am happy the author treaded lightly on it.One thing that did stay with me after I read the book, was how the characters each always made it a point to say thank you to the nurses. For me, that rang so true. The way the author captured that moment. The vulnerbility felt when you must rely on the kindness of strangers to help you when pain is enveloping is like realizing how vast the ocean really is."
5," didn't put off reading The Fault in Our Stars for any particular reason. Truth be told, I waited to read this one mostly because I was low on fundage to spend on buying books. Despite everyone else's ravings about The Fault in Our Stars, I just put off buying it until my mom gave me a gift card for Christmas. And thus it was purchased and thus it was read.I now firmly agree with the raving John Green fans out there that this man is perhaps brilliant. And The Fault in Our Stars is definitely brilliant. I was hooked on the story and Hazel, the main character, no later than page 10 and laughing out loud no later than page 19. And of course squalling like a baby before the end.John Green takes you on a magnificent and emotional journey. There are many of witty lines that would have won me over alone, but add to it the nature and content of the story and I was pretty much blown away.I will say that emotionally I had to put the book down for a bit. Some friends we know through church lost their seven week old son tragically and I just couldn't read a cancer book while also thinking about what they must be going through.All in all The Fault in Our Stars must be read. There were multiple quotes that I actually noted and want to share with you, but they are all spoilery in nature, so yeah, sorry. You'll just have to read it for yourself. And that you very much must do.The Fault in Our Stars gets 5 very well-deserved stars from me. Have you read The Fault in Our Stars? What did you think? Let me know!"
4," finally--FINALLY-- read it! Regular visitors know how much I don't like contemporary, but this isn't just contemporary. This is so completely different from anything else I've ever experienced. When I finished reading, all I could think was Why did I read this? It's the most painful experience I've endured in a very long time.I don't think I can really review this properly. The characters weren't just characters, they were real people. They had such real emotions that I can't describe them in a single paragraph! Hazel was just...wow. Augustus was just...double wow. Just trust me. If I go into any more detail I might just burst into tears.The famous quote everyone's seen at least once sums up my thoughts about the book perfectly:I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at onceIt was exactly like that for me. I started out just sticking my feet in the water, giving it a little taste. It was good, but not great. Then the next thing I knew I had fallen in, overwhelmed by how incredible it was. Once I reached a certain point (those who have read it know exactly where), I was a wreck. I just started sobbing. Thanks to other bloggy friends I was prepared physically with a giant box of tissues, but nothing could prepare me for the emotional trauma that was suffered that afternoon.Moderate Language and Sexual Content: (Multiple d*** s*** a** f***, kissing, descriptions of making out, Augustus and Hazel do sleep together, but it's not explicit at all, crude and suggestive humor throughout)"
5," love this book. Heartwarming,romantic,and a story so closely inbound with life and death and love that it's wonderful. This is a story about Hazel Grace Lancaster,a 16 year old girl with lung cancer,to say it in simplest terms. She meets and falls in love with 17 year old Augustus Waters, a boy with a cancer that unfortunately I cannot remember the name of. He lost his leg due to the cancer. I recommend this for anyone 17 and up, though I am eleven and read it. Hazel gives her very mature opinion of love,life,death,and everything in between. From the ghettoziation of scrambled eggs to how it feels to have a loved on me die,from making the adjective version paedophile to finding the sequel to An Imperial Affliction, this book has it all. I guarantee you will not be disappointed in reading this. This a...how shall I put this...overly romantic scene in the book,so younger people (I.e. preteens and younger) may not be able to read this comfortably. To quote the book The fault,dear Brutus,is not in our stars, but in ourselves.  The dead are visible only in the terrible lidless eye of memory. The living, thank heaven, retain the ability to surprise and to disappoint.  You do not immortalize the lost by writing about them. Language buries, but does not resurrect and lastly,  “That’s the thing about pain,” Augustus said, and then glanced back at me. “It demands to be felt.”This book will not disappoint.I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.(I was not attempting to plagiarize the quotes just attempting to share with the public world.)"
2," Loved the book.  As a parent who lost my 27 year old daughter to leukemia, I was amazed at John Green's ability to create such rich and authentic dialogue and emotions.  Many friends thought the subject matter might have been hard on me, but oddly it was a gift to me to see how two young people seeing life through the cancer my life is so not certain lens navigated all the challenges.  Having the support group characters as well as the subplot of the Amsterdam author and all that raised for the main characters enriched the story line.  I thought they did a great job with the movie too, although I liked the book better and gratefully read it before I knew the movie as coming out.  I preferred having my own visuals of the characters before actually seeing the actors--who, by the way, did a fine job.Kudos John Green!  I had to read your bio mid way through the book because I couldn't imagine how you could write what you did unless you either a) had had cancer as a young adult or b) had a young adult child with cancer.  When I found out you had neither a nor b, but you were a chaplain in a children's hospital for all of 5 months, it blew me away.  I appreciate your honest and raw capture of some very tough stuff for kids/families to experience.  You pull back the veil on all of it and give readers/viewers a close up and pretty accurate view of the good, the tender, the hard and the heartbreak of losing a child/boyfriend way too soon.  I shed some tears and the loss of my daughter was undoubtedly in the mix.  Thank you."
5," The Fault in Our Stars is a coming of age tale of a female protagonist with cancer that will eventually kill her.  Through her cancer kid support group she meets a singularly legged boy who will become her romantic interest.  Without having to make this a spoiler review, I will stop the description here.The Fault in Our Stars was a very well written book given that it is written for a younger crowd than myself.  The story line keeps moving, it never stalls or drags on, and has its fair share of surprises and twists and turns.  This book is particularly interesting to me in that there is a female protagonist which is unusual and also that she is diagnosed as (what I would call) eventually terminal from the first page.  This is not something we come upon during the book.  So there are lots of very well described situations throughout the book as they could only be told by someone who is coming to accept their mortality and the frailty of their existence.The ending to this book, and by ending I mean probably the last 5 chapters, are horribly sad!  I can't recall a time where I didn't have tears welling up frequently as this book reached its end.  As you start to realize how this story is unfolding the feelings of dread and sadness build into this awesome crescendo and the inevitable revelations after the big event (trying not to give up the spoiler here).This was a very well written, book that I could not stop reading.  I would recommend this book to just about anyone... Just have your tissues handy."
5," thought this book was very good and very well written. as a 16 year old myself, i felt that John Green did a very good job in writing in the place of a teenage girl. much of the book depicted Hazel's thoughts, and i felt that her thoughts were realistic and similar to a teenage girl's. the segments about her parents and her friends and how she felt like she was hurting people by having a terminal illness were very striking, and it was interesting to get into the head of a cancer patient, ever though she is fiction. there was also a lot of anticipation in the book. you knew that anything could happen at anytime, and that keeps the reader reading. you never know what is going to happen. in many books, you can kind of guess what is going to happen and when, but in this book you never knew, just like how in real life; you never know what is going to happen. as the book went on, i really felt that i knew Hazel and and could commiserate with her and her troubles because her character was developed so well. details about her and her life were revealed early on in the story and it allowed me to focus on the story, instead of having to develop the characters for myself. i really loved that i could practically feel Hazel's feeling for myself. i also really loved this book because it is not only a book for teenagers or adults. anybody can read this book and relate to it in some way, whether its through Hazel, her struggles, or other characters like Gus. it is not necessarily a book about cancer, but a book about life and its ups and downs."
5, actually downloaded this book by mistake but once I started reading it I was hooked. John Green (if he's written others I'm going to read them!) creates amazing characters and tells a story that will stay with you for some time to come...
5," Simply a great read.  I loved it from beginning to end.  It takes a sad journey and gives it a perspective that is unlike any other.Hazel, Gus &amp; Issac are all great characters with a quick wit that lightens the mood of what's really going on.  They don't sugar coat life because life hasn't dealt them the best hand.  Rather than be victims they face their fates head on, calling things for what they are while the rest of the world tip toes around the reality. They don't have time to wallow or be victims and they know it.Personally, I don't get the 1 star reviews that complain they don't speak like regular teenagers. Or the writing wasn't up to their standards.  Well, these characters AREN'T regular teenagers.  All three have a point of view that is unlike those of their peers.  That's the authors intent.  They are faced with a short life and because of it, take a different approach to how they see the world.  That's pretty much the POINT of the book.  Some people pick up a book an tear it apart like it's a college thesis that should be literary perfection. They say, it's not written realistically or the story has holes, it's not authentic to real cancer experiences etc.  I feel sorry for them....because in the case of this book, they are focusing on words on paper instead of immersing themselves into the journey.Pain demands to be felt.  Truer words have never been written.Saw the movie as well....equally as great."
5," When I started reading this story I was a little thrown by the way the teenage characters talked.  It was odd to me.  Sometimes they talked about things that were far above my head, but I suppose when you are diagnosed with a terminal illness at a very early age it forces you to grow up fast.Augustus was easy to like.  Even when he dangled an unlit cigarette from his lips, which usually I would find repulsive, he is charming, and everything about him pulls you in.  Hazel Grace was refreshing.  She’s a strong young lady trying to protect those around her, never letting her illness define her.At times, this book was hard to read.  I felt like a voyeur peeking in on someone’s most difficult, humiliating moments.  At other times, this book made me smile and laugh out loud with its own unique brand of humor.  I didn’t quite understand their obsession with a quirky book in the story, but that didn’t matter.  These characters made me care about them, made me root for them and their love story.Some people call this book a “cancer story”, but I don’t think that is accurate.  Yes, this book is about death and how we deal with death, but more importantly it’s about love and how you live.  Hazel and Augustus are always true to themselves and live accordingly.I know I’ll be a wreck when I see this movie, but what I took away from this story was that we don’t get to choose how long we’re here on this earth so live honestly, love completely and you’ll be okay.  Okay."
5," The Fault in Our Stars was a book I had to read in my Senior Literature Class. I love to read and this book spoke to me when I heard about it, so I bought it. And now I've read it and I think this is a really beautiful book that can truly relate to the reader. I'll admit I really do not cry because of books I read but this one hit me hard. I could not stop reading even though at times I wanted to throw the book against the wall and go cry in a corner somewhere. That normally does not occur when I read books. But it happened because I was able to connect to Hazel's feelings.Now I know many will think Who wants to read a book about people dying of cancer? But I would respond by saying cancer is not what the book is really about. I mean yes, it is a major part of the plot but that does not mean anything. The main point of the book is about learning who you are and how to accept you are. Augustus Waters came into Hazel's depressing life and turned it upside down. He made her realize she was not just her disease; she was a beautiful, smart, and funny teenage girl.I think everyone should read The Fault in Our Stars because it can connect to anyone. Everyone has been touched by cancer in at least one point in their lives. Everyone has felt worthless. Everyone has fallen in love. I believe that people ages 15 to 115 will enjoy this book because of that. So if you enjoy literature, and want a book to read that will make you want to never stop reading it, pick The Fault in Our Stars."
5," While the story was OK, I had been prepared to be swept up in this tragic romance.  Lots of sad things happen in the book, but the whole thing was boring.  There was nothing about the characters that captured me.  I found them bland and one dimensional.  I also found several of the plot points rather contrived."
5," Where do I start? I really loved this book. I had high hopes going in, and at a price like $3.99, I can't complain about my purchase at all.Hazel Grace Lancaster was such a refreshing change in YA lit. Many heroines I come across are unrealistic or annoying, but Hazel was easy to connect to and root for. Her character wasn't dumbed down for readers, she was funny, and I loved the conversational tone her narration had.Augustus Waters.... oh, Gus. He is one of my favorite male leads ever. He's not your average good looking lead. He's intelligent, funny, charming, and an all around good guy. Like Hazel says, he's no Prince Charming, although sometimes he likes to try, but his best moments are when he's just being his human self.I loved Hazel's mom, and how dedicated she was to making her daughter's time left on earth as good as possible. She celebrates every single holiday on the planet so Hazel won't miss out, and for once, parents play an important POSITIVE role in teen lit. No disappearing parent syndrome here.The plot was good and kept my interest, although it was occasionally a bit slow. I had a hard time finishing it because the ending emotionally affected me (I take my reading very seriously) but it was a beautiful story.I would definitely recommend this book. If I could give this more than 5 stars for making me bawl like a bitch-baby just THINKING about the book after reading it, I would. Will definitely be reading again!"
5," A book about kids and cancer is going to tug at your heartstrings. What JohnGreen does well in The Fault in Our Stars is give the kids lives and commentary that do not dwell on the obvious.The narrator, Hazel, has an incurable cancer. She home schools, she goes to Support Group (with excellent caustic remarks unspoken), and truly cares for her parents. Her parents face the worst with courage, but of course they are clingy.Hazel meets a new guy at Support Group, Augustus. He has had one leg amputated. Their friend in common, Isaac, is about to lose his other eye.So the details are not pretty. But the kids find a way to be kids. They are fairly philosophical at times, and mad-cap ridiculous at others. What I loved about Hazel and Gus is that they settled on Okay as short-hand for always or I'll love you always. They have hormones, they want to live and experience life.Most of all, they want to find answers to the book that brought them together, An Imperial Affliction. They both email the author and wait and wait and wait for answers. They know that as cancer patients they will get the victim credit and probably hear from him.What they don't know is the fault in our stars, what fate has in store for them in terms of their lives and their illness.Green handles the improbable with grace. This is a fine YA that will bring a smile to your face even as you are crying your eyes out. Lovely, lovely book."
2," The Fault in Our Stars is the fifth novel by American author, John Green. Hazel Grace Lancaster is a quirky sixteen-year-old with terminal lung cancer. In a Support Group she deems of doubtful value, she meets one-legged seventeen-year-old Augustus Waters, survivor of osteosarcoma. Gus and Hazel click almost immediately, sharing music and books, movies and jokes. Hazel's need for closure about the characters of her favourite book leads them both down an unexpected path. The characters are appealing and most of the banter is funny, if occasionally having the saccharine sweetness of My Sister's Keeper (the terrible movie, not the brilliant book), but ultimately, there is plenty of humour (some of it quite black), lots of wisdom and moments that will have tears welling in the eye of the most cynical reader. The plot has a twist that will hit hard. The best quote is by Peter van Houten (and as a cloggie I have a perfect right to laugh out loud at this one!): Dutch is not so much a language as an ailment of the throat. This book is a look into the truly unique world of the cancer patient, dipping into the cancer patient's lexicon, touching on subjects as diverse as cancer perks, relationships with terminal patients and fear of being a grenade: a ticking time bomb that wounds everyone close to you when it explodes. Whether this is a realistic portrayal can only be judged by someone with a terminal diagnosis, but Green certainly presents an interesting perspective. Funny and moving."
5," This is one of those books that I kept hearing about and seeing on various Best lists, but just couldn't force myself to read because the premise sounded totally depressing. The joke's on me because I ended up loving it and understanding all the hype.There is some sadness (how could there not be with this type of story?), but it's surrounded by enough humor and honesty to balance it out.This is a character-driven story and I loved Hazel and Augustus. They're smart, witty, and playful despite being in horrific circumstances. Occasionally, their characters fall into the Dawson's Creek trap of having conversations that are way beyond the language and thought process of your average teenager. And, these kids have read far more serious literature and poetry at age 17 than I've read at age 34. But, who wants to read 300 pages of OMGs, LMAOs, and likes, which I'm guessing might be closer to how a realistic teenager speaks today? I want to read smart, witty dialogue even if you sacrifice a bit of reality in the process.After reading the book, I discovered that John Green is also well-known for his video blogs and has a huge Twitter following. As a caveat to my thoughts on his book, I must say that I was not an established John Green fan before reading it (I'm not one of his Twitter followers and haven't seen any of the video blogs)...I just loved the book for what it is.For more reviews, check out my blog, Sarah's Book Shelves."
4," was intrigued by the story line in this book, and how clearly the author drew the characters of his hero and heroine. There was almost an element of fantasy or other worldliness in the book, and I think the author created that mood by choosing to tell only one aspect of the story of two teenagers caught up in dealing with cancer. It's as if these two are marooned on a desert island, and that part of the story is in color. When they interact with the adults in their lives, even with other teens, the story is told only from their point of view, almost in black and white because it's so incomplete. Part of the fun of reading the book is entering into the language and culture of the two teens. As a book for here and now, this is a plus, but in my opinion, it does not bode well for its chance of becoming a young adult classic. I will recommend this book to my two teenage granddaughters, if only to introduce them to the idea that life brings us no guarantees, regardless of our ages. From 2000 to 2006, I taught yoga to cancer patients, and their families, and also did a workshop at a conference for teens who had survived childhood cancer. I think the book captures the obsession and egocentricity of many of these kids, but it misses some of the maturity and wisdom these young people acquire, whether they survive or whether they die. I gave the book four stars because it's an excellent book for what it is, but it's not a book that I found either thought-provoking or life-changing."
5," This is an incredible story about two cancer-stricken teens who fall for each other despite knowing that they won't have much time together. This is a story that is labeled for teens, but these characters have been through so much in their lives that they're mature far beyond their years. The themes of this story reach far beyond teen issues and anyone of any age will find plenty to relate to.This is the story about Hazel Grace Lancaster and her struggle to deal with her terminal cancer and all that it entails. She is acutely aware that her death will result in immense pain for those who love her and therefore has distanced herself from most people. She is caught off guard when she meets Augustus Waters who is not only interested in her but is relentless in his pursuit of her regardless of the circumstances. He slowly breaks down her barriers and they fall deeply in love with each other. Unfortunately their love is short-lived but they're both completely okay with it.There is so much more I'd love to write about in regards to this book, but it simply wouldn't do it justice. There are so many different issues that this book addresses (and some aren't fully answered because sometimes there aren't any exact answers). It is a beautiful story and even though the movie is extremely well-done and a fantastic movie on its own, it simply does not fully capture the story of Hazel Grace. I highly recommend reading the book before seeing the movie."
4," won't be reading another 'cancer book'. Life has enough of this playing out in front of my eyes without reading it too. But still, even though I kept putting it down, I kept picking back up and wanting to read on.There were times reading this when I was crying from sadness and laughing at the wittiness, both at the same time.Maybe most teens don't speak in the same way Hazel and Gus do - but wasn't that the whole point of the star-crossed lovers. Two people that, due to circumstance, gave up their path and left their old friends, and started another path without compromising who they really are for the sake of what the world says is normal teen behavior and normal teen-speak. Two kids who, due to circumstance, would analyze and philosophize in ways they wouldn't usually. And two people, quite different from others around them, find themselves drawn together. The question occurs, if they didn't have cancer and had been their 'old selves' would they have even liked each other? In hindsight, which life would they choose?These aren't the first tragic star-crossed teen lovers, and they won't be the last (in fiction or real life) but this version of that story was contemporary, real and well written. Was everything accurate? No, but it doesn't matter. The message was clear: that we are fleeting in this life; relationship and friendship means more than how much time we have or than the heroics that the world tells us we need to perform."
5," (NO SPOILERS) This book is the most perfect book I have read in a long time. I don't think I have cried that hard since Snape confessed his undying love for Lily Evans. So lets get to why I love it so much. Many, many reviews on Amazon are saying that this book has too complex of dialog for teenagers, but in the end, wouldn't you rather have a good descriptive dialog rather than the boring rather than the  repetitive language of the actual teenager. I just said rather so many times, but it makes me quite irritated that anyone would want the descriptive words to make one of a teenager.(SPOILERS THAT MIGHT GIVE AWAY SOMETHING BUT IT IS VERY HARD TO FIGURE OUT THE SPOILERS IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THE BOOK) It has been a week since I have finished this book, and I still keep thinking about it. Every single day I think about the love between Hazel and Augustus Waters, and how Hazel  must have felt at different points of time. This book review is kind of all over the place but, I wish that at the end of the book (after the email from Van Houtons assistant) I wish that I could have figured out what happened to Hazel after reading the thinks Augustus said to Van. I feel the same need to know what happened to Hazel, as Hazel did for the Dutch Tulip Man.All in all this book is in my top five books. If you are struggling to decide whether or not to get this book, get it. It will change the way you look at your own life, and not many books can do that successfully."
5,"m over 100 pages in and it's very depressing. I bought the book based upon an interview with John Green on 60 Minutes. The consensus was it wasn't a book about cancer but a love story. Sorry, but so far all it's been is about cancer. Since it's so popular, I'm going to donate the book to my library."
5," This book has been getting rave reviews all over tumblr (social media website) and John Green is getting touted all over as a genius. Of course, i had to witness this for myself. This book is open and honest and very quotable. The banter between characters is amusing and the deadpan manner with which John Green conveys it in is pure gold. The twist in the book came completely unexpected and blindsided me. I didn't cry, but I feel almost like I need go give a moment of silence for the characters struggles in the book.I don't normally read books of this nature, I prefer to stick to action and adventure and fantasy. I like to read about the supernatural and travel to different worlds. This book grabbed me from the very beginning and made me keep turning the pages to find out what happened next.Also, other comparable ebooks on the market are maybe 9.99 and I really like how the price of this one is so reasonable. 3.99 for a popular and newer title in the ebook industry is like finding a unicorn. It's well worth the money and more. Pick it up!Edit 1: I knew the 3.99 was too good to be true lol! They upped the price because now it's being advertised all over and what with the movie coming out they know they stand to make a profit. I'm not mad, but I'm disappointed for those who missed the great sale.Also I should say that the book reads as a little pretentious, I won't pretend it isn't. But it's still very likeable."
1," have to admit that I had ridiculously high expectations for this novel: I've known and loved John Green's other works for quite some time- the mere idea that this one might be anything less than John's usual standard wasn't something I was willing to entertain. Then there was the fact that I had pre-ordered my copy about six months before it was released, meaning that by the time the shiny blue cover dropped through the letterbox I was just about ready to explode from suppressed excitement and nervous butterflies. Of course, I needn't have worried that I'd be disappointed.  The Fault in Our Stars didn't just live up to my expectations, but blew them all into microscopic pieces and set a whole new, glittering bar for Young Adult fiction in the future.I'll spare you the plot details, save to say that TFiOS is simply about being young; about falling in love for the first time; about facing mortality and illness and deciding how you reconcile with the fact that nothing, not you or the greatest novels or the best people, can exist forever. Simply put, TFiOS is beautiful and whilst the story is tinged with plenty of sadness, you can't help but feel uplifted by the warmth and humour that permeates every chapter in the form of Hazel and Augustus.Read it. Love it. Devote your attention to it wholeheartedly. And most importantly give yourself plenty of time, because the moment you finish you'll want to turn back to the first page and start all over again."
5," For a girl who begins the book telling us she is dying of cancer and might be depressed, Hazel Lancaster is certainly one of the most alive characters I've read about in a book for a long time. In fact, every character in this novel is so vividly written that you feel like you could be friends with them. I was worried that the fact that many of the characters have cancer would turn this in to a depressing book where I pitied the characters more than anything. I'm so glad that did not turn out to be the case. I've read other reviews where people say the book has too much melodrama, or that the teenagers are unrealistic. On the contrary, I think the book handles the inherent melodrama of cancer quite well, and there is enough humor and inside jokes sprinkled throughout to balance the parts which necessarily make your heart ache. And I think the readers who say the teens aren't realistic aren't giving teenagers enough credit.It is rare that a book moves me to actual tears because I care so deeply about what happens to the characters, but this book did. It is also rare that a book forces me to rethink my perspective on things for days after I read it, but this book did as well. And isn't that what you want, when you read? You want a book that takes you so completely outside your reality that you think about things and feel things that you haven't experienced before. If that's what you look for in books, The Fault in Our Stars is for you."
2," Hazel has been sick for three years, and she knows she's not going to get any better. When she meets Augustus Waters, everything in her life changes. Augustus is funny and vibrant and unexpected. The two bond over Hazel's favorite book, An Imperial Affliction, and before they know it, they're falling in love. Suddenly Hazel's life is a whole lot more than the falling action of an unspectacular novel.John Green's latest book is absolutely brilliant. His characters are so realistic and down to earth, but fantastically memorable at the same time. Hazel is sick, but she tries not to let her illness define her. She's very funny and her gallows humor makes her a very accessible character--she's a teenage girl who doesn't take herself too seriously, not a heroically strong, righteous sick girl. Augustus livens up the book much in the same way he livens up Hazel's life. His endless humor, just-go-with-it attitude, and his metaphorical take on life and death are all so appealing. There are many literary references that drive the character and plot development in The Fault in Our Stars, but they flow just as naturally as the pop culture references, making the book unassumingly intelligent. The twist to this story is tragic, yet the book isn't a sad one. Like Hazel, who makes the funny choice when telling a sad story, Green makes a potentially depressing topic overflow with humor and life. The result is something achingly realistic and human."
5," The Fault in Our Stars was an amazing book. The story was very well put together and the characters were fun to discover, despite the sentiment the book is meant to give. It definitely ended the complete opposite way that I thought it would, and that's what made it 10 times more enjoyable.I loved learning about the characters, more specifically Hazel Grace Lancaster and Augustus Waters, the main characters, as well as Isaac. I found it was genius to have a completely different love story than any other, especially with the different personalities going around. Regardless of it being a sad book, it was nice and refreshing to see characters with different approaches on life.The way John Green formulated the story was nice and made the book an easy read. I think my favourite thing about it was that it ended a bit like An Imperial Affliction, an imaginary book in the story. It basically ends in the middle of a sentence. What happens to Hazel? To Isaac?  We will never know.That being said, I have to give this book 5 out of 5 stars, not because it made me emotional, not because it was a beautifully written cancer story, but because John was able to create something original all on its own, something different other than the fact that it was a different kind of love story. The Fault in Our Stars was fresh, new, and definitely worth my time.I look forward to reading the rest of John's books."
5," The most important thing to know going into The Fault in Our Stars, I think, is that the dialogue is *totally* unrealistic. The heroine and hero are 16 and 17, and nobody, and I mean that literally, nobody talks the way these kids talk, especially but not limited to teenagers. Think about the fast-paced and overly deep dialogue in Gilmore GIrls or anything by Aaron Sorkin, novelized.And it's absolutely brilliant.So Hazel and Augustus don't talk the way people really talk. The thing about it is that they talk the way people *feel*, and that's what makes great stories great stories and real life so often boring and confusing and frustrating -- we can never quite say things the way we mean them, but these characters can.And this is a great story. Not in the sense that the plot pulls you in and keeps you on the edge of your seat, nothing like that; I knew more or less what would happen from the first 25 pages or so. It just doesn't matter. The language is captivatingly beautiful--I doubt there were ten wasted words in the whole thing--and Green has a way of phrasing certain maybe-otherwise-unremarkable observations about life and human nature that makes them thought-provoking and soul-rattling and unforgettable. And the way things unfold, even if you know exactly how they're unfolding, is beautiful and heart-wrenching. I really can't recommend this enough, and would to just about anyone."
5,"t has been a long time since I last read a book this good - Young Adult fiction at its best.  The romance is vaguely reminiscent of Love Story, without the melodrama and the sentimentality.  The language is effervescent and the book grapples with the hard questions of life with tremendous intellectual honesty.I was curious to read what detractors say about the story.  There appear to be two main pieces of criticism.  The first is that the characters don't speak like teenagers.  That seems like a gross over generalization of teenagers.  I certainly spoke like this when I was a teenager, as did most of my friends.  Not every teenager is uneducated and unable to string two words together.  Having said that, we are talking about characters who are extremely erudite - characters who, for instance, find the existential angst of Sylvia Plath interesting.The second is that many of the supporting cast of characters are somewhat unidimensional. This criticism is accurate, but then again, this is a Young Adult novel and not a vast meandering work of literature that fully explores the world.  Moreover, the book is written in first person and in a sense, how much you learn about the various characters is really a function of the narrator's interest in those characters.The point is, if you have not read this book, you should.  There are few books you are likely to encounter that are this moving."
5," John Green's latest New York Times bestseller The Fault in Our Stars doesn't disappoint those of us who have come to adore his fast-paced witticisms and charming insights into the minds of today's youth. The storyline follows a teenage Hazel Grace as she battles thyroid cancer, makes new friends and becomes ensnared with Augustus Waters. Augustus (who is remission) meets Hazel at a support group helps her achieve her dream of meeting her idol, an author by the name of Peter Von Houten. While reading you are hoping for a happy ending even though you can feel the storm cloud lurking above your head and the heartbreak approaching. I feel as though I can say with certainty that The Fault in Our Stars is the most heart wrenching love story in modern young adult literature. Despite that Green manages to help the reader look past the heartbreak and realism though-out the journey and fall in love with the characters even when we know it's doomed. In today's current literary climate of sparkly vampires and love struck zombie's Green writes a Young Adult novel that reaches into the human consciousness as the characters' ponder their own mortality and the realistic chances of surviving cancer. He makes the reader deliberate on life's big questions, feel gripping emotions and laugh through the sadness. This is the kind of novel that can inspire young adult's and change the face of YA literature."
5," This book is absolutely fabulousI recommend this book to people that enjoy love storiesIt made me cry, it made me smileCouldn't have asked for a better book to readI love your work John green &lt;3"
5," This book was slow to start but became more interesting as it progressed. The POV is entertaining with a dry sense of humor. Overall, it was good enough to finish but it will not make recommendations lists for friends."
5,"m always a sucker for a cancer book. Don't really know why since I'm very much a hypochondriac and since my reading of The Fault in Our Stars have already scheduled myself for a physical... just in case, you know, I have cancer. Don't judge.The Fault in Our Stars was amazing. I read it in a few short hours. I was that engrossed and fell that in love with its characters. Sixteen year old Hazel is living with cancer and upon her mother's request begins attending a youth cancer support group. There she meets Augustus Waters - cancer survivor and the type of guy who grabs life by the reins and just runs with it.Yes, this is a cancer book. But don't see that as a downer. Both Hazel and Augustus are such uplifting characters. They give the story a light tone and not make it as suffocating as some cancer books can be. Their witty sense of humors, the way that they deal with sickness, their friendship and budding romance as well as their obsession with An Imperial Affliction and its author make a fascinating read.Needless to say, it IS a cancer book, so there were tears shed on my end, but I would not trade those moments for laughter. I was enthralled by this story and was very impressed by the way Mr. Green tackled some heavy subjects in a tender yet masterful way.Hands down The Fault in Our Stars is one of the best books I've read in a while... and that's not a cancer perk."
2," knew what to expect when I picked up this book. I wanted to read it before the movie came out (which is a thing with me, and probably millions of other readers). John Green is a writer in the highest form of the word. The way he wove this story and the characters together was an epic journey.You pick up this book, and you know what's coming, but all along you have this nagging hope, this positive optimism that Green never offers you himself. Yet you hold your breath waiting. Things cannot be this bleak, this heartbreaking for two teenage kids. Yet that is one of the things that make this story so powerful. The heartbreak.It is heartbreaking to read about Hazel and her lungs. Heartbreaking to watch her parents grieve for a child that is still living. It is heartbreaking to watch these two broken beings fall for each other and be better for it.The writing and the story deserve a five star rating. It is from my own sadness and my normal upbeat self that it received a four. It is just TOO sad, TOO much heartbreak for someone such as myself.The Fault in Our Stars transcends YA fiction. This is a book for all ages, for all of time. But you have been warned. It's a downer. Yet it isn't if you take it for what it is meant to be.Okay.I recommend this book to fans of YA fiction and romance."
5," Oh. My. Word.This book freaking ripped my heart out. I emotionally died, but it was the most pleasurable of a death, okay? I loved all the characters, the story, and the writing style. Sometimes the dialogue of every character seemed to be the same unnaturally flowery speech that is not common for teenagers, but I loved learning new words and phrases like 'hamartia' and 'sobriquet.'I have not thought so much about the meaning of my being here on earth in a loooooong time. This book truly makes one wonder about his existence and the purpose. As Augustus would say, My life is existentially fraught. (Another phrase I learned)Which brings me to the characters. John Green made these characters so REAL. That is the best way to describe them. Their reactions to situations were just like a person in their situation in real life would be like. These children with cancer did not have amazing, miracle-expecting, hopeful attitudes. They were as bitter as I expect I would be if I were in their situation. And this resulted in me thinking of them as real people rather than characters in my book.WARNING: This book will rip your heart out, tear it into little pieces, pour gasoline on it, and light it on fire. But it is so worth it. This is probably the best book I've read all year, and it definitely pulled at my heart and maybe shaped it slightly different."
2," This book was an awe inspiring work of literature. It was a book that not only met my requirements for a good book(such as plot development) but also inspired a deeper want to know and love this world. To look at art and say that it is beautiful is one thing, to look at art and say I want to add more to it is another. Because I believe that this earth, this world, this space of physical being, is a great painting. And no matter what you believed made that painting, you are, and forever will be, part of that work. You may be an infinitesimal drop of paint, but you are there. This book aroused that understanding within me. I am a twelve year old, I am in sixth grade, and I go to a public school. I am average. I most likely will never write a book of any worth, nor will I find a cure for cancer, but I, along with everyone else on this earth, will contribute something to this great painting. The fact that humans are even able to relate our life to a painting is remarkable. The universe and a painting are completely different, just like red and square are. Yet we are able to see a connection, to see a relationship between two complete opposites. I believe that this shows us that humans were not made for this earth, but to live around it, as pure beings of consciousness. If a book can arouse this type of thought from a twelve year old, what could it do for someone else?"
5," will start by telling you this: You will cry. If you do not cry there is a strong possibility you have no soul and you should probably get that checked out. I went into this telling myself I would not cry because everyone else said they did and I would too. So, I figured since I am expecting it to be sad I will be prepared. I wasn’t. You won’t be either.  I do not want to give a single spoiler even though you can go see this at the movies right now. I figured this would be much like other loves stories that are entwined with tragedy. (A Walk To Remember, P.S. I Love You, etc) The characters were believable and well developed. I felt an incredible bond to Hazel, Augustus and Isaac. We follow the story as told to us by Hazel and she maintains a consistent and REAL voice throughout.  This was not a teddy bear soft, candy coated version of a sad love story. It was soul shakingly, heartbreakingly raw and painful. You know those girlie moods we get when we sad “I need chocolate and a fuzzy blanket and a really good tear jerker”? This is it. I read this book yesterday and I still feel the ache in my chest. My fiance sat beside me several times yesterday and stroked my head as I sobbed and read.  I realize I have told you no real details and I am okay with that because I insist you read it yourself. Now…Go…I’ll save you some tissues."
5," Don't let that dreary back cover copy deter you-this is a beautiful book!  John Green covers the whole range of human emotion in this gem of a YA novel.  He mixes big-time tragedy, complicated and interesting characters, and a surprisingly funny cancer support group to serve up one sublime cocktail of a story.Sixteen year old Hazel has cancer.  The extra bad kind.  She meets Augustus at her cringe-worthy support group and sparks fly.  We watch them fall in love, grapple with issues of morality, life, and death, and face their uncertain futures together.  Even Hazel's character states, Cancer books suck.  This is not such a book.I was impressed with the emotional depth of both Hazel and Augustus.  Unlike most YA novels, the big bad evil awful keeping them apart is the ugly reality of a future, or lack of it, with cancer.  We witness two young people facing a crash course in growing up, and deciding what is really important in their lives.  It reads as a true, totally believable love story.  It's far more than that, though.With all this seriousness, though, it's still an extremely witty novel.  I actually laughed while reading it, which is rare for me.  Green is a master with realistic dialogue.  He writes teens with compassion and utter understanding.Please give this gem a try.  You'll be happy you did."
5," Holt McDougal is my absolute favorite novelist, and this is the book that got me hooked on his work. Its quite obvious he pulled some inspiration from the always brilliant John Green. Truly a work of art."
5, bought this book when it first came out and finally almost 2 years later got around to reading it as I wanted to read it before the movie came out next month.  First John Green book I've ever read sadly...... this one touched my heart especially the last chapter where Hazels looking around soaking in every detail.  I caught my dad doing this in his hospital room before he died..... Intently focusing on every detail of each family member in his  room that day...... when I realized what he was doing I leaned over and whispered into his ear  I'm taking you in too Dad...... this just brought back all those memories and I sobbed  through most of the book..... But if you pass by this book thinking it's only going to make you sad you will miss out on such a tremendous experience..... The humor is so much like my family when both my mom and dad died.... we cried we laughed we cried again. I purchased the audible for this book which I must say she did a fantastic job as well.... And I am very picky we're audibles are concerned..... This book isn't so much about death by cancer as it is the celebration of life.... And the joy and miracle of love! Highly recommend this one as it'll no doubt end up on your list of top favorites.  So glad I read it before the movie and so glad I finally stop procrastinating... Extremely glad Mr. Green finally finished it.
5,"m not a fast reader. Even with a good book it takes me at least a week or more to get through. But I finished this book in less than 12 hrs (would've been less than that but life kept doing that annoying thing of existing and interrupting).Putting aside the beautiful story of the characters for a minute, the writing was flawless. If there was no plot whatsoever I would still curl up and die from the beauty of John Green's prose. He is one of the best. Every page had a paragraph or line I wanted to highlight or tattoo on my forearm to remember forever. Fantastic truths that could resonate with anyone, healthy or sick, young or old.But of course the story, the beautiful, epic tragedy that is Hazel and Augustus. It tore me up, made me think, made me laugh; I wanted to be in the room with them just to observe their crazy, witty yet philosophical debates on even the simplest things. Their love story was beautiful, but also the connections with other characters. I loved Issac's story just as much as the main characters. I felt for these people without ever having gone through what they were going through. John Green brought them to life in a very real, poignant way.I think of all the years I've been on Amazon, I've written maybe 2 reviews. This would be the second. If you don't read this book, you are missing out."
5," This book was recommended to me several times yet I didn’t pick it up until my book club decided to read it. I hadn’t heard or read any review before hand which I am truly thankful for because it would have ruined it for me.This is one of those books you go into knowing someone is going to die. Let’s face it – kids with cancer – there is only one way for it to end. What I wasn’t expecting is how much I truly loved the characters. Kids with illnesses grow up to fast and seem to be always ahead of their years which I found with Hazel and Augustus but they were just so down to earth and real, how could I not fall in love with them?  They were honest about their fears and hopes and scared to wish for more.Augustus falls in love instantly even though Hazel tries to talk him out of it. I love her line – “I’m a grenade”. How many of us haven’t felt that way?  He woos her which is just plain romantic on so many levels. I guess I mostly loved the connection that these two had.The author also did an amazing job with the character Peter Van Houten who was the author of Hazels favorite book “An Imperial Affliction”. He was such a bastard yet I understood him to, actually felt for him.Yes the book is sad and it made me cry but more importantly it also surprised me in ways I didn’t think it would for a YA book."
5," think this is one of those books that I can't fully comprehend due to its sheer brilliance. From the metaphorical dance to the layers upon layers of depth, this book dives far beyond our humanness and into the uncharted waters of infinity and intelligent symbolic interaction.Life, love, and death are beyond humanity's scope of cognitive understanding, our books should follow in suit. Even when we experience these facets of life personally, we uncover layers that inevitably reach beyond ourselves and into the unknown. What I love about this book is that I felt blur between reality and fiction fading into nothingness until the story became so real for me, yet in many ways, incomprehensible like my own life often is.I find some answers to life's big questions, but most of the time I'm treading the waters of uncertainty. This book took me on the journey of Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters as we discovered some answers, but found that there are many more beyond this life that seem unanswerable.This is one of the many books that I will always treasure in my heart. It made me laugh, cry, wonder, and feel the loss of two friends who are confined to a space in time that ends too quickly and cuts too deeply. It is truly an extraordinary work of fiction that deserves to be read and reread for years to come."
5," Originally reviewed on Goodreads and The Hardcover LoverI'm going to warn you that my review of this book is very critical. I did not enjoy this book, but I would appreciate that you respect my opinion. If you really loved this book and might get offended by a negative review, please feel free to stop reading. I won't mind.When I first decided that I wanted to read this book, it was because the synopsis was interesting. A lot of people were talking about it too. And not just the people on Goodreads. I literally heard about this book all the time. Then I started reading, and I realized that the kind of cancer that Hazel originally had is the kind I am most likely to get. It intrigued me enough to keep reading. I mean why not, right? I kept thinking that maybe I could learn something about it in case it were to happen to me.Unfortunately, that was where my interest in the book stopped. The Fault in Our Stars the most predictable book that I'd read in quite a long time. I pretty much knew what was going to happen as soon as a new character was introduced. It was annoying so sit there and read about things that I already knew were going to happen, and it took away from my enjoyability of the book. I don't even know how I knew everything because I'd never read a John Green book before this, so I definitely wasn't familiar with his style.Like I've already stated, I really thought this novel would be this superb book because I have heard and read many great things about it, but honestly, it's just horrid. So many people told me to read it, and while I understand that they love and adore it, I still wanted to smack them in the head with the book upon completing it.The Fault in Our Stars was so easy to read that it was boring. Even the short chapters, which I feel are just included to speed along the plot made it dull and monotone. Like how about some variety there, Green? I read this book so slow because of how boring it is, and I am not a slow reader at all. The time it took for me to get through this terrible book was the most painful reading experience of my life.Augustus and Hazel are two characters who angered me. They were overly annoying, and in multiple ways. I've met a lot of teens, and not one of them talks like Augustus and Hazel do. I've had quite a few family friends suffer from childhood cancer, and this isn't realistic at all. I can't even imagine someone with cancer, especially a teenager with cancer, speaking so beautifully and eloquently all of the time. Don't get me wrong... some of what they said was awesome, but it wasn't realistic. It's just a way to make everything much more romantic than it really is. Also, I was quite offended by how Green romanticized cancer.  I've actually seen and heard kids wish that they had cancer because of this book. I'm sorry, but we can't live in a world where people want cancer because cancer is not the kind of disease that one should wish on themselves.I understand from what Green has said that this book is not supposed to be a cancer book but a book about living with cancer. If you ask me, Green failed and delivered your cliche cancer book. It made me angry to see cancer presented this way because I've seen quite a few of my brother and sister's friends die of childhood cancer and this book was not a realistic depiction of the suffering I've seen.I honestly just don't understand all of the hype about the book. It seems like it gets bigger and bigger by the day. It's not going away. While I'm sure people will say that it's an amazing book, it's definitely not the most amazing book on the planet. If anything, it's one of the worst books ever written. There are better realistic fiction books out there, and I'm only sorry that I didn't stop reading this book. I could have saved myself some time and anger."
5," Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.I always find it intimidating approaching a piece of literature once it's received an unprecedented amount of high praise, and this intimidation only worsens if the aforementioned praise is there from the get go. No one wants to be that guy who goes, Yea... this kind of sucked, because it's fun to feel like you are a part of something. Truthfully, this is one of the reasons I put off reading The Fault in Our Stars for so long, and though I'm pleased to announce I am not that guy, I didn't love it, either.One of the things that immediately differentiates this story from majority of the books I've read is the way it was written. The Fault in Our Stars is told from the perspective of 16 year old cancer patient, Hazel Grace--right off the bat that's three new elements: first person, cancer patient, and the main character's a woman. Because of this, I soon became enthralled by what I was reading, and before I knew it three hours had passed. Within the first sitting I had already burned through half the novel, and if I didn't have to deal with my daily obligations, I would have kept going.And it is through Hazel's journal-esque storytelling that the narrative progresses for the entire novel. As a cancer patient, Hazel's mom makes her go (against her will) to Support Group as a way of coping with the heavy emotional toll that comes with the territory. This is where she eventually meets Augustus Waters, a cancer survivor who now has to wear a prosthetic leg. Though there is an obvious connection, Hazel fears perusing a relationship on the grounds that she's a grenade, but anyone who's ever read a love story knows how that goes.The thing that captured me instantly--and I love when authors pull this off--was how vivid and real everything felt. I was there with Hazel in Support Group; I could see her facial expressions, and hear the shyness in her voice as she talked with Augustus (aka Gus) for the first time. Best of all, I felt for and related to her despite the fact she was a woman. The writing truly is captivating, charming, and confident in itself, which is what makes this such an easy story to jump into and get lost in.However, it did reach a point where the way John Green wrote these characters began to defy the laws of realism. There's no arguing that there are some truly intelligent young adults in the world, but the idea that these two individuals are not only extremely philosophical, but also capable of perfectly articulating some deep emotional insight on the spot is highly improbable. A realistic outlook on life may make you more intelligent than your peers, but Hazel is still only 16 years old.This unrealistic aspect is not restricted to character traits, however, but also in the way Hazel--and to some degree, Augustus--seems to get whatever she wants. As someone who has never had the misfortune of knowing someone with cancer, I can't comment too much on this, but the two main characters label this phenomenon as Cancer Perks. You're a minor and want alcohol? Sure. You already used your wish, but you want to go to Amsterdam? Why not. In my opinion, there has to be a point where an adult just goes, No.Aside from these two things, my only other minor complaint would be the rushed and sudden nature of the novel's conclusion. In retrospect, the ending itself is perfectly fine, but there was never a sense a closure for me as a reader. It felt as if there was still some story to be told, and had John Green paced himself a little more, I think he could have avoided this. Other than that, though, the writing is spot on, and this is the first book in a while where I haven't found any typos or other strange errors in the text.Overall Score: 8.2/10 - Is The Fault in Our Stars good? Definitely. Is it the perfect, soul crushing, best-book-ever-created novel that people make it out to be? Not really. It's an imperfect story about our imperfect world, and it manages to consistently entertain despite its flaws. Hazel is an extremely likable, and beautifully realized, character that has you itching to get to the next page, and the way John Green handles the subject of cancer is commendable, to say the least. I would say check it out, but based on the fact the movie just came out I'm sure you already have."
2,"t's been two years since this book came out. Two years since I read it. Since then, I've read it multiple times, and have continued to fall in love with the story and characters.This book is my favorite not only because it's well-written, has a good storyline, and interesting characters, but because some of the themes in this book are extremely relevant to my life in a way that makes me understand the purpose of this book even more. It makes me appreciate the side characters, like Hazel Grace's parents, in a way that I wouldn't have before, because I've seen my parents think that they were going to lose a child plenty of times, and I've seen it break their hearts. That's just one of the many examples of why this book is so emotional and captivating.I like how there are funny moments as well as sad ones, because, for most teenagers, life isn't one or the other, but a mixture of both. There are pretty sucky, tragic things that happen, but also simple moments that make us laugh. I think that John Green balances them out extremely well, and, as a teenager, not once did I think that his portrayal of teenagers was off.It's been two years, and I still suck at talking about this book. I love it too much to put it into words, and it means so much to me. I hope even more people can enjoy this book, too!"
4," The Fault in Our Stars is so profound and moving, that I do not feel that my review can do it justice. TFiOS treads the line between all human emotions: Joy, fear, shock, incredulity, and humor to name a few. This is a book that, without giving spoilers, explores some of the deepest and most asked questions of human existence while never being condescending or self-righteous, and with no attempts to merely hand the reader the answers. TFiOS is that rarest of books in which you can both laugh and cry on the same page, a book that draws the reader so intimately in that in the course of the novel it becomes real. John Green's works exhibit an uncanny knack for making the fictional world become real for the reader, and TFiOS is no exception. It develops complex and believable characters with assets and flaws the same as any real person. TFiOS is truly exceptional in the sense that it understands that Young Adult does not mean that the reader is uniformed or ill-equipped to handle real themes and real issues. Much like Paper Towns and Looking For Alaska, TFiOS gives the reader just enough discussion of deep and meaningful questions to encourage exploration while offering new insight into the world in which we live. John Green's ability to imagine complex characters is on par with the greatest of all literature. TFiOS is, in short, a masterpiece: beautifully sculpted as only a genius could create."
5," Hazel Grace has cancer of the terminal variety. There is no cure, no getting better and no chance of survival. But a drug called Phalanxifor is helping to prolong her fight, even if it isn't curing the build-up of fluid that creaks her lungs.Hazel's mum and dad know what a blessing it is to have her with them for just a little while longer. But her lengthened life won't mean much if she doesn't get up off her butt and do something with it. So they send her into the Literal Heart of Jesus (architecturally speaking) - to a cancer support group where people talk and cry, praise the battle-weary cancer kids and repeat stories about losing their testicles to the big-C. It's a hoot.And then one day, while sitting around discussing a cancer survivor's current state of ball-lessness, Augustus Waters walks in, and everything changes.Augustus Waters is currently in remission, minus one leg courtesy of the cancer monster. Augustus has stared death in the face, and laughed heartily . . . and now he continues to chortle. He sticks cigarettes in his mouth but doesn't smoke them. He is a terrible driver. His best friend is about to be blind, and he falls irrevocably and stupidly in love with Hazel pretty much at first sight.But Hazel is reluctant. Augustus has already lost so much to cancer, and she doesn't want to be another grenade in his life (sure to wound) . . . so she tries to resist his crooked smile and general hotness. Just friends, okay?`The Fault in Our Stars' is the new contemporary YA book from astronomically popular Edgar &amp; Printz winning author, John Green.Brace yourselves. John Green's newest book is a love story starring two cancer-ridden teenagers. Yes, it's sad. Yes, it's actually so sad you will blubber while reading and be all snotty by the last page. Expect great big gulping, hiccupping tears. The embarrassing kind. The kind you don't want to shed on public transport. You have been warned.That being said . . . this is a John Green novel, so it's totally worth your crying, blubbering, hiccupping, snotting tears. Truth be told, `The Fault in Our Stars' is down-right magnificent.Our narrator is Hazel Grace Lancaster - terminally ill `cancer kid' whose mortal coil has been somewhat lengthened thanks to a (minor) miracle drug. But Hazel has been sick for so long that she doesn't exactly know how to be normal and just live. She's only sixteen but attending college, having surpassed her classmates studying by herself while being cooped up indoors. She's a quick-witted firecracker of a girl who has side-stepped the brink of death only to become a terminal couch-potato (addicted to `America's Next Top Model'). Her mother, and full-time carer, wants to see Hazel interact with the world. Hence, Cancer Support Group in the Literal Heart of Jesus. Hence, meeting Augustus Waters. Hence inconveniently falling for a cancer survivor who she is bound to hurt and maim when the death-knock sounds for her.**The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,But in ourselves, that we are underlings.  ***Hazel and Augustus grow closer (despite her reservations) when she shares an important part of herself with him in the form of her favourite book, Peter Van Houten's `An Imperial Affliction'. A book famous for ending abruptly, and somewhat incompletely, about a cancer girl and her glass-eyed mother who falls for a rich Tulip Man. But the abrupt ending plagues Hazel, and then Augustus. Peter Van Houten has not written another word in seven years, and has no plans of writing a sequel or answering fan-mail.I loved the story behind `An Imperial Affliction', mainly because it felt like Green putting a little tiny bit of himself in his book - a bit of life imitating art. John Green's first novel was `Looking for Alaska' - a Printz-award winning book that beguiled and surely frustrated many teen readers. Frustrated, because there's a rather crushing death in the book that is never fully explained. No definitive reason is given for a beloved character's passing, and I have read reviews in which people cursed and lamented the lack of resolution at the end of `Alaska' (despite the fact that there's truth in the not knowing). In `Fault', Hazel and Augustus wrack their brains over the abrupt mid-sentence ending of `An Imperial Affliction' - which hints at the protagonist's death, but never confirms it. They become obsessed with the idea of getting the answers from the author, Van Houten himself.I loved this story-within-a-story. It feels like John Green speaking rather directly and affectionately to his readers (but it should be noted that Green couldn't be further from the Van Houten character). Through Hazel's obsession with `An Imperial Affliction', Green assures readers that he understands how important fictional characters can be . . . that they have a life of their own within reader's hearts and minds, and that the author has a certain `contract' to fulfil with the reader by letting them walk into our lives and consume us for a little while. And consume us they do, such is the case with Hazel and Augustus . . .These characters will get to you. You'll wish that they are real people you can hang out with, talk to them and try to keep up with their whip-quick comebacks and banter. You will love them. Augustus is sweet and earnest, a perpetual optimist who goes after Hazel with everything he has. He and Hazel are a riot together - bouncing off each other beautifully, able to sway between deep metaphorical musings and laugh-out-loud repartee. They're both a little bit brilliant. Which is why reading their doomed star-crossed love hurts so much (and will induce aforementioned snotty blubbering).Something I especially love about John Green novels is the abundance of quotable quotes. I come away from a Green reading with many curious thoughts and ideas to turn over in my mind. And since the themes and topics in `Fault' are so expansive - hopeful and morbid, set on epic life-or-death scales - the book is full of heartfelt reflections and pin-point accuracies.Nobody should be surprised to learn that `The Fault in Our Stars' is simply sublime (as we all knew it would be). John Green is exploring a deathly disease with gallows humour and infinite tenderness. It's a total cliché, but you will laugh and you will cry. And by the end of the book you'll feel a little bit bruised and battered, tender and exposed. But Hazel and Augustus will stay with you for a long while after reading, John Green having fulfilled his promise to the reader that these characters matter; they have weight and substance, and they will not be easily forgotten. You will feel lucky for having read about them."
5," read this straight through and I have that reverent, other-worldly feeling right now that I just may never find another book that touches me so deeply or so affects me that maybe I should give up reading altogether.This is a must read- being both well written and accessible with wonderfully drawn characters and captured beauty, even in the ugliest moments:The BiPAP essentially took control of my breathing away from me, which was intensely annoying, but the great thing about it was that it made all this noise, rumbling with each inhalation and whirring as I exhaled. I kept thinking that it sounded like a dragon breathing in time with me, like I had this pet dragon who was cuddled up next to me and cared enough about me to time his breaths to mine. I was thinking about that as I sank into sleep.Green, John (2012-01-10). The Fault in Our Stars (Kindle Locations 1673-1676). Penguin Group. Kindle Edition.It is a worthy read.  It may leave you feeling a bit off-kilter afterward but that is because your world will have been given a shake.  Yes, this is a book about a teenaged girl dying of cancer but this book is so much more about living life and making the moments count to last us an eternity if need be.  I cried- wept a bit actually, but I also laughed and hoped and felt like I went along for the amazing ride.  It did not leave me feeling despair, it left me feeling alive and I like books that can do that to a person.This is an amazing book and probably now ranks among the best of my favorites."
5," Every character talks and acts the same way. It takes away from any realness to the book and the people in it. All that may be somewhat okay if you actually enjoy that singular persona. But to me it comes across as incredibly pretentious, arrogant and self-centered. By the end of the book, I didn't feel anything for the characters or should I say character. When the taxi driver starts spurting out metaphors, you know something is not quite right. And for all those ridiculous metaphorical intellectual discussions, it was surprisingly shallow. Those fancy big words or smart literary references don't seem to add anything to the book. The only thing I really learned was the personality of John Green and perhaps the people who directly relate to this book. That made me more sad than the ending. The connection between Hazel and Gus was based off superficial lust and mutual pseudo intellectualism. And that drives me crazy because the cancer and the shared pain is probably the strongest bond there could be. Such a wasted opportunity to truly explore and share that pain. Even at the bitter end, it was still about the looks and silly words. I mean really? If this book was done in an honest emotional way, it could have been heartfelt and real. It scares me a little that people can relate so strongly to this book."
5," had just downloaded this book on my Kindle (best  $3.99 I ever spent)  when a 16 year old friend, who's a voracious reader asked me if I'd ever read the book or heard of the author.  She told me it was the best book she'd ever read and that she read it straight through in four hours without stopping except to refresh her kleenex supply.  I was honestly not thrilled about the subject matter since I have a special needs grand daughter and spend a lot of time in the company of these amazing children who are dealing with extraordinary adversity.  I was, however, very happy that I'd purchased this book once I began the journey and that was the case throughout, to the end.  The characters have been tagged by some of the other reviewers as not being typical of teenagers but they've obviously not spent time with many young persons bearing the heavy burdens of cancer, CP, MS, etc.  This is a gritty look at the hardships involved for the children and the parents of terminal illness, yet first &amp; foremost, it's a love story which transcends your expectations.  Love of self, love of that one special person many times described as our soul-mate and love of parents who sacrifice daily to care for these special children.  It's all here in what is obviously a fictional representation of the reality of many.  Bravo,  Mr. Green."
2," This book is something I probably shouldn't enjoy, but loved. The Fault in our Stars is predictable, surprising, lovely, horrible, and treats that guilty pleasure of a romance in a philosophical setting."
5," Now...I do not say that this is the best book I have ever read lightly. I have read....a lot of books in my life, it is what I do...read non stop. I bought this book along with the perks of being a wallflower and truly had very little intention of reading it, it was just a whim. Then I started it. I was caught immediately and did not put the book down until I finished which was about 9 p.m. I laughed, I shamelessly bawled my eyes out while my husband looked on in confusion and I was devastated when the book ended...and at how it ended. But I was also...happy is not the right word because it's tragic, but, hmmm. It gave me a sense of closure and the book ended with something that made me smile despite the tears. I was so distraught I went to the movie, in a theatre an hour away to see the last showing 11:25 p.m. I just had to see this. I cried at the movie theatre too...this book is funny, insightful and heart wrenching in its poignancy. This is profound, it is not a book that has a title like 'and the highlander wore plaid.' This is not your run of the mill novel. It is deep and touching and I was thoroughly impressed (and sexist lol) that a man could have written something that touched me so deeply. Absolutely hands down the best book I have ever read. Bravo John Green for this masterpiece."
5," This book and its telling si a gift beyond entertainment.  John Green's insight into human mortality is powerful and meaningful.  Teenagers forced to face mortality by the challenge of cancer when their understanding of self and life are yet undiscovered is bold, painful, and genuine.  It was a story that chose John Green for the telling.  It was an eleven year struggle to deliver this book.  I am thanful for John Green's apprciation of the augmentation of the story that could happen through a spot-on narration and for Kate Rudd who delivered it wonderfully.  John Green gets the power of the numbers in the story of cancer.  Agustus has a diagnosis of bone cancer with an 80% chance of survival.  The non-cancer patient will wonder why you shoud be worried with numbers like that.  But Agustus chooses a burial plot and a death suit.  I recall the the doctors revelation of my childs prognosis with a diagnosis of melanoma at age 19.  85% chance that the cancer could be surgically removed and 100% cure.  If the melanoma had spread (15% chance), then the chance of survival was 5%.  Cancer robs teenagers of their immortality.  I adore the characterand spirit of Hazel Grace.  I rarely read a novel more once.  I will reread this book as I know there willl be more to aborb on a second go round."
5," had heard great things about this book, so I decided to download it on my kindle today at roughly 4:30-5:00 PM, and here I am at 11:46PM writing a review of this lovely book.Let me just say, wow! Breathtaking dialogue! The amazing way of how Hazel and Augustus would speak to one another in an intellectual and poetical way, was truly amazingly written. The story line was very unique, yet it wasn't outlandish or far fetched in any way possible. My only problem with this book is that my expectations for men in real life have now been ruined by the very much original character, Augustus Waters.I must also add the context, in which a teen girl such as myself, that which Hazel has told the story was very relatable and enjoyable with how John wrote her describing 'ball-lessness' or throwing in a few 'whatever's' just to remind readers that she still is in fact a teenaged girl with just a better than most vocabulary and more developed way of how to say things.Recommended this book to my dear friend and even offered to read her a chapter a night before school starts up again. I however was joking, but from my summarized version of the story, she kindly accepted the offer. I however am going to make her read it on her own terms. All in all excellent book!"
2," found this book to be amazing to the point of reading it almost non-stop for two days straight until i finished. (that almost beats the record made by the hunger game which i finished in the course of one long school night and regretted for one extremely tiring school day) i didnt really know what to expect out of this book before finally being able to read the first page, and though i could tell that it would be more meaningful and insightful than all but one of the books that ive ever read, both fiction and non-fiction, i still didnt know my feelings for it. now that i have spent all of my time for the past two days reading and absorbing every last bit of the book that i could grab, i do realize what made me love it so much; it was different. true there are many many love stories in the world and many other stories that make you feel a roller coaster of emotions and that make you think about life and death and the true purposes of everything, including the universe itself, but never have i seen/read something that can combine all of these properties into one being so seamlessly ever before in my life along with so many other indescribable traits of a novel and story, and never before this book have i ever been able to describe something so meaningful in simply one word:  Okay."
5," decided to buy the book The Fault in our Stars because I've heard all of the rave reviews about the book and it was a great price. The Fault in our Stars is about Hazel meeting a boy named Augustus (Gus for short) at a cancer support group when Augustus came to support his friend Isaac. Hazel &amp; Augustus hit it off right away. They both view the world in an uncommon way. Hazel loves reading and gives Augustus a book to read An Imperial Infliction, as it is her favorite. Augustus loves the book, even though I believe he loved it because Hazel loved it. The thing about An Imperial Infliction is that the book just ends in the middle of a sentence, that is the ending. Both Hazel &amp; Augustus want to know what happened because there are so many questions left unanswered. Augustus still has his one wish left from the genies because he is also a cancer survivor. He decides to use his wish for Hazel and take her to Amsterdam to talk with the author of the book in person before Hazel dies from her terminal cancer. While there some very awesome things happen but I don't want to give it away. You HAVE to read this book! I couldn't put it down. It's a very enjoyable read and easily one of my favorite books. Just make sure you have a box of Kleenex by you because your going to need it."
5,"ve been looking to buy this book for sometime now, and finally caved to try it. Normally, I don't enjoy YA fiction very well because, well, I find them usually poorly written. That is far from the case of this book. John Green's writing reminds me somewhat of Kurt Vonnegut's. Not in the writing style, but rather, like Vonnegut, Green can write work that is easy to read quickly and miss how deep the actual words are. It honestly takes deliberate readings for the words to mean what they were intended.The main characters, Hazel and Augustus, were wonderful. I admit that I didn't much care for them at the beginning. They sounded too self-pitying (Hazel) and pretentious (Gus), but by a third of the way through, I had come to love them both. I love that Hazel isn't worried about being an inspiration to all people in her illness, but rather, that she is just trying to live a life with cancer the best way she knows how. Augustus... what a wonderful character. The metaphors, the smiles, the romancing. He made me swoon, and I'm a straight guy. :D Together, their love story paints a picture that I couldn't even conceive at first.By the way, surprise character: Isaac. He's hilarious, and I couldn't help but feel sorry for Monica for losing out on such a great guy."
5," Just as the title says, it's a breath taking book. So detailed  and moving! I felt as if I had known the characters in reality and it brought me to tears in some parts of the book. When I read the reviews, didn't believe I would cry since I've  never cried when reading a book before,but when I read this I has to try my hardest not to cry. It was so deeply written it got to me. Despite the sadness, there were parts that actually made me laugh out loud, which I've never had a book do to me! SPOILER ALERT: I literally could not stop laughing when Augustus told Issac's previous girlfriend's mom that a blind man was egging her daughter's car and to step back into her house. I definitely recommend this for young adults and teens because of the huge vocabulary needed to read and understand the book. There are 2 or 3 sexual scenes in the book such as SPOILER ALERT when Isaac was trying to arouse his girlfriend in front of the church, and another scene when Hazel and Augustus were in the bed. This book will definitely go on my shelf, and it is my favorite book. It really has changed my look on life and has moved me so greatly. This also inspired me to start a long forgotten book of my own. Thank you a million x infinity John Green for making this extraordinary book I will favor for life."
5," purchased this book without any prior knowledge of its plot or who John Green was, so I think I was pretty unbiased going into it. All I knew was that everyone was reading it and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about, and boy am I glad that I did. This is one of the best books I have ever read, especially in the Teen genre, and I have read A LOT of teen books. Not only is the story really entertaining and never dull, but the characters are FANTASTIC. Seriously, a few chapters in I found myself in awe of how relatable, realistic, hilarious, and lovable the narrator, Hazel, is. She's just amazing. For some reason I'm always hesitant when I see a male author writing from a female perspective, but John Green executes it perfectly. I was literally laughing out loud at what she was saying, which is perfect because, while the novel is hilarious, it also tears out your heart and rips it into a million pieces. This book will make you feel every emotion possible, and it will dig down deep inside your heart to make sure you never forget it. Novels written for the young adult market very rarely capture the voice of that generation as well as this one does. It really is worth the two days it might take you to read it, and I promise you it will make you a John Green fan for life."
5," This is the second young adult novel by John Green I've read in recent days.  Like Paper Towns, The Fault In Our Stars's main characters are bright, articulate, teenagers, but with a significant difference:  Hazel and Augustus have cancer, and they are going to die in the very near future. Before they do so, they are going to have to endure pain, medications, trips to the emergency room and long hospital stays, and still more pain.It's a bleak prospect, but The Fault In Our Stars is not a bleak book. Hazel and Augustus are warm, funny, people who don't flinch from what's in store for them. Their chief source of encouragement and support is a book written by a reclusive and mysterious author. Hazel and Augustus's quest to find him and get answers to their questions is the core of the book.I really enjoyed The Fault In Our Stars. I saw the movie some months ago, and as is usually the case, I think the book is much better.  These are real people whose sufferings are not glamourized or made into some noble tale of sacrifice and redemption. (There's some redemption here and there, but it's not the main story). Cancer hurts and dying hurts even more, and that's made clear here.  But what's also made clear is that love and determination don't die."
5," Usually I don't buy into overly hyped books, they often are all hype no substance and I end up feeling had. You have had to have lived under a rock not to have heard the hype over The Fault in Our Stars a book so loved Hollywood got into a bidding war over the rights.So yeah I though another overly hyped YA novel and about kids with cancer to boot, nah I'll pass but the it was super cheap this week and so I gave it a go. I sure wish I paid full price. I feel guilty buying it on sale. It's that great.Hazel has lung cancer and she meets Augustus who is in remission for bone cancer at a teens with cancer support group. They strike up a friendship and romance comparing survivor notes and their love of books.They become obsessed over a book and it's non ending to the point that Augustus uses his make a wish on both of them going to Amsterdam to meet the author.I won't give away anymore of the plot as not to ruin this beautiful book. I rarely cry while reading but this book made me cry often. But it also made me laugh a lot.Please don't overlook this perfect gem because it's a YA book or because of the subject matter of The Fault in Our Stars. It was one of the best books I've read this year!"
5," ( I first posted this review on [...] )This Review ( if you can call it that ) is gonna be hard to write, Since i’m still not over it. After finishing TFiOS, the tears just wouldn't stop. My Review isn't gonna be long, for i can't write this without crying. It took me longer to finish this book because of ALL that. Like i had to keep shutting the book and then open it again. I don't know why it took me so long to buy this book, well i guess i do cause i usually hate reading about realistic fiction( i am more of a Dystopian person and Etc ) but i do not, Not ever regret buying this book. The Fault in Our Stars has completely changed my life and how i view it. This book has already means so much to me. It is a very sad book, but it’s still very Beautiful.John Green you are my hero!!!I think everyone needs to read this book. Yes you are gonna cry ( and if you don't you have no soul ) Yes you are gonna want to throw this book or lock it with a key and lose the key in the ocean, But it is soooo worth the read. I PROMISE!Now i’m gonna go cry in my bed.Okay? Okay( i know my review probably sucks BUT YOU JUST DON’T UNDERSTAND HOW FREAKING HARD IT WAS TO WRITE THIS! Sorry for caps )"
5," THE FAULT IN OUR STARS, narrated by Hazel Grace Lancaster, who is suffering from stage IV metastatic cancer, meets Augustus Waters in a teen cancer support group. The sixteen-year-olds share witty, intelligent banter as they get to know each other. This isn't about living with or dying from cancer, although cancer looms with the characters--Augustus lost his leg several years prior and Hazel uses an oxygen tank as her cancer has spread to her lungs. This is a story of two people who, although cancer has shaped their adolescence, are as typical as any teen with a challenge (and most teens have challenges sometimes big like cancer, sometimes more ordinary like insecurity).THE FAULT IN OUR STARS, though classified as young adult, is not just for teens. I'm an adult cancer survivor and I saw myself and my survivor friends in Hazel and Augustus--we're funny, often irreverent about our cancers, as both a coping mechanism and a way of life, because frankly, life is better that way.Though at times Hazel sounds older than sixteen, she's taken her GED and in college, plus cancer seems to mature children as they are surrounded by adults during treatment, family and the medical community.There is little FAULT in THE FAULT IN OUR STARS."
5," This is a great read.  Even if you've witnessed one or more cancer dances, The Fault in Our Stars will affirm your faith in the creativity that cancer can extract from the human spirit.  My reluctance to read this book turned around one day as a student paced back and forth struggling to think of a way to finish a piece of writing.  She blurted, My thoughts are stars I can't fathom into constellations. The quote fit her situation perfectly.  She then shared that she had quoted one of the main characters of the book.  I teach 7th graders language arts and during the winter EVERYONE was reading this book.  We shared many rich impromptu discussions.  Every once in a while a book comes along that takes kids to a new level.  This is one.John Green's portrayal of young adults in love in an extreme situation is brilliant.  Terminal illness in the young is always tragic. Greene endowed the two main characters with attitudes toward their sickness and each other that are heartwarming and heart wrenching.  The adult characters were very weak in comparison.  I would have preferred the adults to be either nonexistent or to have been much more in the background.I recommend this book to all fans of young adult fiction."
2," This book is absolutely, undeniably one of the BEST books I have had the pleasure of reading. I will not deny myself in the simple pleasures of such as reading a marvelous book. It feels as though this book was written by a teenager, in the best ways possible of course, by which I mean that you truly understand Hazel's feelings, and also Augustus's at the same time. They are both truly amazing characters, I hope that one day I get to find out what fate awaited Hazel Grace in all of the beauty she was and is. I don't believe characters stop existing once you close the novel of your choice but that they live on in their own world.I plan to go and see the movie, and Mr.Green I pray to a God I don't believe in that you did not let them ruin this amazing tale by removing the joys brought to me through my imagination. If you are reading this review in hope  of knowing of whether or not you should read this then my answer is a finite yes. Read it. Over and over. Keep tissues nearby. Expect the plot twists but don't, it ruins it if you do.But importantly - remember that this is just a story of fiction, and although Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters may not really exist they are still loved whole-heartedly. -Ashlee W. (Age 14) are12199@gmail.com"
4," The Fault In Our Stars is a story about the side effects of dying. In all reality, since each one of us is in our own dying state every day, everything we do is a side effect of dying.This heart-warming, tear-jerking story is about a sixteen-year-old girl, Hazel Grace, who has a terminal illness. She knows, like so many other kids in her situation, that her set of days is numbered. She goes to a Support Group for kids with or who previously had cancer, and one day she meets the wonderful, beautiful, charming Augustus Waters. I won't spoil anything, but be prepared for one of the greatest stories you will ever read. Friendship, love, heartbreak, strength, and beauty are all things discovered in this piece art. This book is truly wonderful.So, I encourage you, reader, to buy this book. It is so worth it, with it's beautiful story about two cancer victims with the deepest thoughts and sense of puzzlement about the world. Yes, I cried for hours after I finished reading, but perhaps it was because the characters have a way of thinking that I strive for, and also, Augustus Waters is my new dream Prince Charming. I am in love with John Green's story and I cannot wait to see what he will write for the world to ponder next."
5," can't believe the book is over!  Hazel and Augustus will live on in my memory forever. How can a mere human being(John Green) create such real, living breathing characters?  The star-crossed lovers sprang to life from the very first page of this wonderful and truly unforgettable book.My son once said that reading books allowed you to know what it felt like to live someone else's life, and The Fault in Our Stars gives us a chance to have terminal cancer. While this might make the book to seem like a serious downer, John Green's skill as a writer makes Stars a study in what it means to be human.Hazel knows she not as heroic as cancer victims are supposed to, she's just a teenager who wants to live.  She describes herself as the grenade ready to go off at any time touring the lives of all those that she loves. Gus is a boy who just wants to have mattered in the world. A boy who realizes that the cancer that could kill him is made up of himself.What the book teaches us is that we find what we're looking for by giving it to someone else. A profound story on so many levels. If I were a teacher of middle school to high school students, this would be required reading.  I will certainly be passing it along to all of my friends."
5," Maci's Review-The Fault in our stars is an amazing book. It is about a teenager name Hazel who is dying. Hazel is dying because she has cancer in her lungs. Hazel goes to a cancer support group and she meets Augustus Waters there. Isaac brings Augustus to the support group. Isaac and Hazel get along, they both feel the same way about the support group, they hate it. Augustus has touched with cancer before and they soon become close friends. They like to think about death and life.This is an amazing book. If you have emotions you will cry when you read it. This book really makes you think about life and death and the significance of life and death. I recommend this book to anyone who wants a good read.Zoe's Review- When I read this book I did not cry. This book had many sad parts and many happy parts. This book is fun to read and laugh out loud funny. It had just the right amount of everything, from humor to romance. This book is about two teenagers who fall in love, both of them have cancer. The book is the story of both of them and their view of the world. I liked this book and the ending was satisfying for me. I recommend this book to anyone who liked the book Out of My Mind or Wonder."
5," This is a story of love, of life, of death and of all the things that make them worth it.  While most sixteen year old girls carry a designer backpack, sixteen year old Hazel Grace Lancaster carries a portable oxygen tank.  Diagnosed at age thirteen with Stage IV Thyroid Cancer that spread to her lungs, Hazel takes an experimental drug that has prolonged her young life.  Still terminal, she's been living her last years dying.  Her parents have become her best friends and her best friend is becoming a stranger.  Forced to go to a Cancer Kids Support Group in The Heart of Jesus at a local church, Hazel meets Augustus Waters, a seventeen year old former basketball star who wears a prosthetic leg from the knee down due to a bout with Osteoscarcoma from which he is now in remission.  Their relationship blossoms and they bond over a book called An Imperial Affliction by Peter Van Houton, about a young girl battling cancer that just ends without explanation.  Did the young girl die?  Was she too sick to continue to write her story?  Seeking answers from the author who lives now in Amsterdam as a recluse in a state of constant drunk, Hazel and Augustus embark on the journey of a too short lifetime. ✰✰✰✰✰"
5,"f you haven't read this book yet, you absolutely need to get a copy and read it ASAP!! It will tear your heart out and put it back feeling all mangled up. But it will hurt so good, because this is, by far, one of the best books I have ever read. The emotions in this book are so genuine, and the characters so real, you won't be able to put this book down. And seriously, bring a box of tissues!!This may be YA literature, but to me it did not read like YA literature. It has something for everyone in it. The teens are so likable, which I don't always find to be the case in YA fiction. And they were funny in a way that only kids who are dying of cancer can be, I think. And the parents...as a parent, oh how I felt for the parents. I don't even want to imagine what their pain feels like, but Mr. Green wrote about it in a sensitive and caring way that shows great respect, and I love that.This book made me laugh and made me cry. It is a veritable roller coaster of emotion. And I love all the characters in it except Peter Van Houten. But he is the kind of person you love to hate.Seriously...I can't say it enough...go get this book! It is AMAZING! It deserves 10 stars!!"
5,"m not much into young adult fiction, despite having tried one recently, so I was reluctant to try this one. But seeing it ranked #2 on Kindle for best books last year I had to try it and was also motivated by some of the other reviews.  Fortunately, this book does not disappoint.  The characters and story are engaging and riveting.  It's hard to put a smart, witty spin on something as sobering as cancer, but The Fault in Our Stars does just that.  Even though the author claims at the end that she despite her research on cancer, she chose to use or invent as she saw fit.  That surprised me a little, but did not take away from the story and the depth of the characters.  My only complaint would be that Augustus and Hazel seemed much too mature for their age and their intellectual level, humor and conversation seemed a little unrealistic.  But then I know there are some very intelligent youths out there and they are exposed to a lot more knowledge, life experiences, etc. than I was at their age.  So it's plausible.  And more importantly, it kept me engrossed and rooting for them, their love and their lives, despite the all the odds and, as they might say/believe, out of spite over those very odds."
5," Easy read and of course sad! I was expecting that. can't wait to see the movie. I'm not going to give anything away so the review is just general, but it's worth the read for a good cry!"
5," The book definitely kept my interest.  The story was touching.  I cried almost the whole way through!  Being a mom myself, I cried every time the parents cried.Yet, while I was reading I couldn't help but feel that the author was teaching existentialism to his readers.  The platitudes he would throw out through the voice of the main characters, were empty and depressing.  There was no hope in this book.  I finished and still was left just wanting to cry.  Young readers might find some of the existential thoughts, deep and profound.  I just thought they were said and hallow.There is a God.  He loves us.  He has a plan for each one of us.  You can believe that or deny it.  It doesn't change the fact.  I feel so sorry for the fictional characters that Green created, I feel sorry for Green, and I feel sorry for every reader who buys into the depressing lie that there is no God.  I truly don't know how you can live through the grief of losing a loved one.  With the world believing such lies, it is no wonder that there are people like Peter Van Houten, who live in a drunken stupor just to get through every miserable day.Personally, I chose hope and love from a heavenly Father!"
5," had no idea this existed until I realised there was a movie with the same title. I have a golden rule of never watching a movie until I’ve read the book, so decided to get that out of the way. With a host of good reviews on Amazon, I really wanted to see for myself if it lived up to its popularity.I’m sure it’s fairly widely known that the story features two terminally ill teenagers (Hazel and Augustus), who meet at a cancer support group. It’s an instant attraction, both mental and physical, and the encounter impacts their (short) lives.Despite the fact that it’s a little hard to believe the dialogue is coming out of the mouths of sixteen/seventeen-year-olds, the rather excessive use of Capitalized Phrases To Make a Point, and the plot stretching the imagination just a little too far, I really loved this book.It’s easy to get into and easy to love the characters without feeling pity for them. It’s a love story, sprinkled with deep sadness and poignancy, but the writing is razor-sharp, witty, humorous, and engaging. I found it hard to put down, hard to accept that it had finished (note to self: read more John Green!) and can’t wait to see the movie."
2," When I was first told about this book from a friend, I was hesitant. I mean, a book about a girl with terminal cancer sounds beyond depressing. I ended up buying it two weeks later, and I can't believe I turned this book down at first. The Fault in Our Stars is beyond amazing. The Fault in Our Stars is a story about Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters, two star crossed lovers who share their views on life, love and loss. Hazel is a 16 year old girl with Thyroid cancer and mets in her lungs, diagnosed at age 13, knowing that the miracle drug the doctors found is only prolonging her life. She was pulled out of school and isolates herself from any friendships she had, and relies mainly on reality television and her favorite book, An Imperial Affliction, to keep her company. After being forced by her parents to go to Cancer Kid Support group and live her life, she meets Augustus Waters, the metaphorically inclined boy who is in remission from Osteosarcoma. Hazel and Augustus revel in each other's opinions on life, death and philosophy. If you are the least bit hesitant about purchasing this book, buy it. It's the kind of book you will read over and over and just be completely amazed by."
5," read this book months ago, but never reviewed for one simple reason:I couldn't find the right words to say. In all of my reviews I almost always analyze everything: the plot, the characters, quotes, the climax, the ending, ect. I can't do that here. This will remain one of my favourite stories of all time and I hold it dear to my heart. I quite literally grieve over this book. (Like  I said, it's been several months, and I am only in stage one of grief: denial.) This book gives the world we live in an inside perspective at what some people brush off without giving a second thought. I really hope this book helps us get rid of some world suck. All words in the English language are not good enough to describe this book. Raw, heart wrenching, electric, beautiful literature and so much more. Thank you John Green. I really do believe this changed people's lives in the biggest ways and the smallest ways. It certainly changed my view of the world. Everyone should read this book. I've always thought words can have such big influences on our minds and hearts, and I believe this book really proves that. Thank you John Green."
5," Well, Green knows the recipe for selling lots of books and he checked off all of the ingredients as often as he could.I can see the appeal of this story to young adults. It contained emotionally charged topics (love, cancer, death, pursuit of knowledge &amp; acknowledgement, and worldly travel to a great location (Amsterdam).For me, it felt unrealistic to have such sophisticated teens. I understand that had the story been about sophisticated adults it would not have sold as it did.I don't know if the author was showing off everything he remembered from college, making fun of those who have not yet attended, or trying to somehow introduce youngsters to college educated themes. In the end, his intentions don't really matter because he set out to do what he ultimately wanted to do which was sell a lot of books, make a lot of money, and get himself remembered.So for those who don't mind slurping an all inclusive literary salad blended into a thick gooey shake and served to the masses in a huge feeding slop trough ..this literary starter goo is for you.I give the author props though, love it or hate it..he still got paid !!!"
5," This is not the type of book I would normally read, and one I would frankly have avoided when I found out that the main characters meet in a Cancer Support Group.  You can almost see the reach for the kleenex just by reading the book description.  However, I had to find out why this book was getting such amazing reviews, and finally downloaded a sample on my Kindle.  I was hooked on the sample.As another reviewer has noted, this is not a cancer book.  Yes, there is a moment that involves tears and heartbreak, but almost immediately after that an unbelievably laugh out loud moment that had me in tears for completely different reasons.  I can't help but give John Green kudos for making me feel such a gamut of emotions, that still left me feeling good at the end of the book.  This book made you think about life and family and romance and wonderful hopeful things, despite being based on a terminal illness.  I am still thinking about the well-drawn main characters, Hazel and Augustus, and even the secondary characters comprised of their family and support group friends like Isaac.This is not a typical read, and isn't shaking things up what makes life interesting after all?"
3," Every once is a long while, I read a book that sticks with me. It changes the way I think and the way I feel. The Fault in Our Stars was that book for me this summer.The Fault in Our Stars is the story of a 16-year-old cancer patient named Hazel who was literally on her death bed until a miracle treatment saved her. However, she is still terminal; the treatment only bought her more time. A few years later, Hazel meets a boy name Augustus, a former cancer patient, at a support group for kids with cancer. They become friends and the story goes on from there.I loved every second of this book. I loved that Hazel was so honest about everything that she was feeling. She didn't try to dramatize her condition and she didn't pretend to be brave or heroic in any way. Hazel's only goal was to hurt the fewest number of people possible when she died.The author's note at the beginning states, This book is a work of fiction. I made it up. Neither novels nor their readers benefit from attempts to divine whether any facts hide inside a story. Such efforts attack the very idea that made-up stories can matter.This made-up story matters."
5," John Green's writing is amazing!  Although this book deals with a horrible subject there is humor as these two teenagers stare death in the face.  Are they mature beyond their years?  I would guess a cancer diagnosis ages you in many ways.  Hazel and Augustus are not your typical teenagers who worry about being popular, trendy clothes and school dances.  Cancer has taken much away from them but they still have spirit and give to each other good witty banter and much needed unconditional love.Peter Van Houten's appearances are amusing and random as you would assume from a somewhat washed out alcoholic author.Here's a little piece of the book.  A conversation between Hazel and Augustus.There were days of pajamas and beard scruff, of mumblings and requests of him endlessly thanking everyone for all they were doing on his behalf.  One afternoon, he pointed vaguely toward a laundry basket in a corner of the room and asked me, What's that?That laundry basket?No next to it.I don't see anything next to it.It's my last shred of dignity.  It's very small.Read this book it's worth every moment!"
5," Not only have I seen the new movie that just came out Thursday, three times... but I have also bought the soundtrack for the movie... totally obsessed with this epic love story.I will not be writing any spoilers, so no worries.For the longest time my favorite romantic novel and movie adaptation was The Notebook, I also, thoroughly enjoyed, A Walk to Remember.  However, this book puts both of those books and movies, to shame.  The book and movie are better than both, The Notebook and A Walk to Remember, COMBINED! I will say only one thing about this book and it's that... whatever you think is going to happen, probably will not happen so do not try and make any predictions.Some other series I recommend are, The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer trilogy (my fav), The Selection trilogy, The Shatter Me trilogy, The Legend trilogy, Divergent trilogy, and the Delirium trilogy... and obviously the Hunger Games trilogy :)If any one has any questions, would like to recommend any other books to me, would like to discuss any books or discuss tfios movie with me, i would love that!  I always love having new (amazing) books to read!"
5, found that this book was entirely too long for such a very short predictable plot. The only thing that kept my interest was my hope for a different ending than the one I expected.
5," This was a beautiful story. It tells us about two teenagers ages of 16 and 17 who meet eachother at the heart of Jesus (literally, but its like a cancer group therapy). Augustus has cancer that ended up taking a part of his leg. Hazel on the other hand has a cancer that affects her breathing which causes her to carry around a little machine to help her breathe better. Well these two hit it off instantly becoming friends and bonding over video games, books, and movies. Soon they start to fall in love but it seems like the universe (or maybe just cancer) is against them.I loved this book. It was a little hard to get into the book but I stuck through it and I couldnt put it down. Both of these main characters do not speak like regular teenagers, I would know because Im the same age as Augustus, but that didnt bother me at all.I found myself falling in love with Augustus along with Hazel throughout the book.Towards the end I was in tears; swollen racoon eyes, snot all over the place, and that growing ache in my chest.This was a beautiful love story between two people that will forever stay in my heart.HIGHLY RECCOMENDED"
5," This book in beyond incredible. I stayed up reading, holding on to every word written. This book not only, told a story about two young people trying to find their infinities, but it incourages us to find our own infinities. It portrayed life as it is, not as we wish. It taught us that being in pain is okay, that love is okay, and that infinities are real. Before this book, I never tried to think of infinities. I vanished the thoughts from my mind, without giving myself a chance to conceive any ideas from them. I learned that everything is infinite, that infinities are one of life's greatest pleasures. That if we all wished to be encompassed with those infinities you only have to wish. Just like Hazel Grace, and Augustus did. They used their wishes and blamed cancer for them. Maybe we all have wishes, but we just don't see it.I would recommend this book to anyone who doesn't understand life's meaning. Or to anyone who simply needs to have something to hold onto in life. Believe in infinities, that everything and everyone is infinite. The book says this too, Everything in infinite. Some infinities are just larger than others."
2," picked it up because my fifteen-year-old daughter loves John Green.  From the first chapter, this novel took hold of me--and still hasn't let me go.  I don't think it ever will.  If you're inclined to take this book less seriously because it's Young Adult Fiction, well, let me put it this way: Tom Jones kisses Sophia in front of the mirror in Fielding's Tom Jones, Dorothea Brooke and Will Ladislaw kiss in Mr. Casaubon's library in George Eliot's Middlemarch, and Hazel Grace Lancaster kisses Augustus Waters in the attic of the Anne Frank house in Amsterdam in The Fault in Our Stars.  That kiss--and this novel--deserves to be mentioned in such literary company.  My God--what a love story!Virginia Woolf said Middlemarch was one of the few English novels written for grown-up people.  Change 'English' to 'American,' and the same goes for The Fault in Our Stars.  That the book also appeals to young adults is a testament to Mr. Green's gifts as a writer, as well as to the grown-up humanity of young adults.Kate Rudd's audio reading is also beautiful."
5," The Fault in Our Stars is by far one of the best novels I have ever read.  Hazel and Augustus' struggle with cancer and love is deeply moving.  Throughout the novel, the reader will laugh, cry, ponder life and death, laugh, and cry some more.  Hazel and Augustus are deep and give a new unseen outlook on life.  The characters just draw the reader into the story, and feel like they are there personally experiencing the pain, heartache, love, and confusion.  One thing I really appreciated about this novel is that the characters are so human.  They experience pain and illness (cancer).  They experience so much that makes them feel realistic because usually, the author tries to shelter the characters.  Green took reading and writing to a new and better level with this novel.  Life is not perfect.  People get hurt, get sick, and people all eventually die (some sooner than others).  However, life does offer many experiences and things that make it worth while like love.  No one portrays this better than Green in this novel.  It really made me start thinking about life in a more deep and emotional way.  I definitely recommend this book for everyone."
5," As the title of my review suggests, this book hit pretty close to home. I've lost a lot of people to cancer and a lot of people that came into my life later experienced the same things I have. One thing people lack is the knowledge of how to deal with death and help others cope when they have lost a loved one. As this book suggests, you have to look at it as it is. There is no escape from it. The end is inevitable. However, there is always going to be life after yours is over. Funerals are for the living. You go to funerals to support the family of the deceased. The best thing you can do is give the deceased the respect they deserve. Don't grieve over their death; celebrate the life they lived. When people die young, nearly every time somebody will say, It's a shame they never got to live their life. To me, there's nothing worse somebody could say. They were alive and that means they lived a life. They left their mark on the people that surrounded them. They influenced others and their decisions. They were a tiny drop of water that fell into a pond and made bigger and bigger rings. They lived a life, no matter how short their life was."
5," think John Green might just be at the precipice of being one of the greatest authors of the 21st century.To say that this is a young adult book would be a shameful misnomer. Not to say that it isn't about young adults and can't be enjoyed by that demographic, because that is the complete opposite of the truth. I say this to counter the perhaps inevitable defamation of the young adult label in the wake of the Twilight series of rabble, and to highlight the fact that this book - like much of John's work - is universal in appeal and theme.This book is incredible. I recommend it to all people able to read and appreciate it. Hands down, one of the best books I've read. It certainly hits you hard, a book that makes you wish that it wasn't over when it was.I suppose that's the mark of great art - it leaves you wishing that it could just last forever. But, alas, we live in a finite, mortal world. But if ever a work of literature could be called great art, this work is most certainly worthy of that title.I find solace in the fact that the Novelist Emeritus John Green is only early in his career, one that is destined for greatness."
5," This book is misleading. How do you write a book about two kids with cancer without making the book about cancer? Simple: People are not their sickness. They have life and personality and even love regardless of their physical state of being.This book is unfair, just as life is unfair. Some people may argue that the wrong people die. But I say, More power to you John Green! Because this book is a piece of highly overlooked truth. In life, the wrong people die everyday and you'd give anything to have one more moment with them.This book is harsh. It tells the truth about death and dying. It's not always glorious or honorable. Augustus Waters was right, there's no honor in dying of.And yes, funerals are indeed for the living, our last chance to show our great love or conceal our  great hate. To spout the meaningless lies everyone wants to hear, or to tell the hard, sad truth.This book is perfect because it's everything we humans are, hateful, angry, happy, whimsical, honest, painful, disappointing, tragic, uncertain, and loving. I recommend it to everyone who's willing to have their heart metaphorically shattered."
5," Wow!  I don't think any book has made me cry so hard.  I'm an oncology nurse, you would think I'd get used to this kind of thing......wrong!  I knew where this story was going, but still I read on like a masochist.This story is beautifully written and poignant, but be ready to go through a box of tissues.  The characters are well developed and I fell in love with Augustus and Hazel Grace.  I can't stop thinking about them.  This story is easily one of my all time favorites.  However, I will find it hard to recommend to everyone.  It is not for the faint of heart or for those who don't like a sad story or want the HEA ending.  You have been warned.  Just read the first couple paragraphs and you will find out right away this is a story of a 16 year old girl with terminal cancer.  But ultimately, it is about life, love, and dying.I only give 5 stars to stories good enough for me to want to read again.  I read a lot, too many books in my to read pile.  So, for me to want to read it again at a later date, speaks volumes.  This story has good writing, a good story, and makes a lasting impression.  Bravo John!"
5," started this book not really knowing what it was about. I soon found myself falling in love with Hazel and pretending to be at least half the person she is. Even though he is a character in a book Augustus Waters stole my heart almost immediately. I fell for his charming and goofy personality right along with Hazel. This book changed my life. It changed the way I look at things, allowing me to realize what this life has to offer and appreciate everything that I have because nothing is forever. In all honesty this book helped me to find my own Augustus and I am thankful for him each and everyday. I recommended this book to My Own Augustus so that he could love it just as much as I do and he does which made me fall in love with him even more. I don't think anyone should ever be afraid to fall in love because it's really the only thing that matters in life. I think that Hazel finally figured that out, and in turn did not regret the person that had to hurt her when he left this world. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who needs some help figuring who they are in this world, who knows you might just find your own Augustus."
5," read The Fault In Our Stars, and didn't shed a tear. There were way too many metaphors to translate, and although I am fluent in sarcasm, it was sarcasm overkill."
5," This is my first John Green book, and as of this writing, I'm unclear whether I'll read another. It's unlikely that I'll be able to provide any insight that my fellow reviewers haven't already pointed out with expert aplomb. That this book was inspired by a Green fan is magnificent. The central characters in TFIOS are interesting, and the dialogue is a pleasure to read. The problem? It reads like someone who is trying to be so witty that the realism and any connection to the actual persons is categorically lost. No teenagers in my experience talk like this. I've raised three of them. I won't bore you with the details, but yes cancer is prevalent in my family and I've had many conversations with sufferers from the very young to the very old. People don't talk like this. In general, I wouldn't identify this as a flaw, but this book seems to be trying to walk a tightrope of respect for the sick and the truism of life. Instead, it rides the wave of Green popularity, and throughout, I couldn't help but imagine him trying to see how clever he could be with his pen instead of using it to carve out a genuinely big heart."
5," When I started reading this book I, of course, had read a publication blurb so I had a very good idea of what it would be about and what would happen in the lives of the characters, at least in the lives of two of them.  Although that was true, how it was told was a surprise.  Although at times I felt it was a bit over-clichéd and included a few too many metaphors, I couldn't wait each day to be able to pick it up again and spend whatever time I had becoming a friend with the two families and with Isaac, a friend to both Gus and Hazel Grace. I felt I was hearing their conversations versus reading about them and I actually wanted to participate with these children who in many ways were much older souls than I.  I laughed with them, raged with them, cried with them, and, in the end, celebrated them. I will recommend this book to others to read for the beauty and stark realism of being ill, living with it, and finding more in it than just the suffering and loss of hope so prevalent in other books regarding illness and death.  This is a book on living until you don't and doing so in a way to make others wonder."
2," had trouble believing the characters, especially the young ones. A bit too sentimental for my liking, but easy enough to read and be slightly moved by the subject matter."
4,"f the notions of terminal illness &amp; teenagers in love trigger thoughts of a sappy, girly cry-fest... then think again.  This is not your typical young-adult novel, nor is it the cheesy, ‘overcoming obstacles’ story that you may be anticipating.  Hazel Grace was on her way to becoming an ordinary teenager when cancer shrunk her world down to doctors, meds, her attentive parents, &amp; her favorite book.  OK, perhaps a sweet, gorgeous, &amp; intelligent boy from a lame support group falling head-over-heels doesn’t happen everyday, but it seems realistic enough.  Augustus ‘Gus’ Waters is a fellow cancer survivor, with character traits that would delight the parents of any teenage girl.  Their personalities compliment one another, keeping each other in check, while still sharing a quirky humor that is impossible not to love.  Their unusual quest to get answers from a reclusive author in Amsterdam provides adventure and beauty along their ill-fated journey.  This is a sweeping, engaging, &amp; heart-breaking novel.  I dare any reader to walk away from it not having fallen in love with Hazel Grace &amp; Augustus Waters."
2," When asked if this book would make you laugh or cry, John replied, You will feel all these things. He couldn't have been more right. This is honestly one of the best (if not the best) book I have ever read. I laughed, a lot. Hazel and Agustus have such an interesting sense of humor, you wouldn't expect kids with cancer to be so funny. Then again that was one of the reasons John wrote the book. Most cancer books are filled with the sad kid who is dying, but some how with them being in that situation it brings everyone to realized the meaning of life, blah blah blah. This book is not that kind of book. Hazel and Agusust are not those kind of kids. With the laughter part over, I also cried, a lot. It could be because the subject is close to me, but honestly I tried not to cry and yet I still did. There were tears of sadness, and tears of happiness, and tears from well laughing. This book has a wonderful plot and is beautifully written and I would suggest that if you are reading this, and you have not yet read it, stop wasting time with this silly review and get the book! You won't regret it =)"
5," found the book to be a difficult read and I had to push to finish it. It may hold other persons interest however the teen I read this in anticipation of giving it as a gift, I do not believe she would finish it."
5," RATING: If I could give this book as much stars as there are in this entire universe I honestly would, but I guess a measly 5 Hearts will do.This story is not about cancer. It's a story about finding that one moment of bright sunshine as love in a world so dark and overflowing with pain, and then learning to let it go and cherish that love for every breath you draw or for as many times as you blink. This is a story about learning to breathe when sometimes you literally and figuratively can't.And sometimes, I whole heartedly believe that less is more. So, there aren't enough adjectives to describe how fantastically amazing and emotional The Fault in Our Stars is. All I can say is readers pick up this book and experience for yourself the epic story of Hazel and Gus. You will feel, and you will feel hard. I still am after reading it for only a few short hours.To simply put it, this story is a beautiful triumph. Don't miss out on it. You will regret not knowing Hazel and Gus and all the other characters that inhabit its pages.Simply Beautiful."
1," The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars / But in ourselves.This book left me speechless. I still cannot decide whether I loved this book or just liked it.Like all the other tragic love stories I knew someone was going to die in this book but still it caught me off guard when it happened. It happened all too quickly for me (I was expecting it to be slow with lots of tears).I found the characters to be fun while reading even though most of them are suffering from cancer. They accepted what they have, they accepted that one day they were all going to die.There are many quotes that I love from this book, especially this: I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once.This book left me thinking and thinking. I couldn't come to a conclusion of whether I loved this book or liked it (somtimes I even feel like I completely disliked this book)! And I don't think I will ever land up on one particular conclusion any time soon.If you love tragic love stories then, this is a book that you must read."
5," This book is now one of my favorites. The writing style was amazing, as well as the story line. The story brought sad and happy tears to my eyes. I can't believe a man could write a girl part in a story so perfectly. The story has a secret moral too. I think this story represented that we have ups and downs in our lives, and the world isn't perfect. But we need to enjoy the good moments in our lives, and move on from the bad. There will always be another good moment in your life. I also love how the author portrayed hazel as a smart, sarcastic, but very opinionated girl. She knows a lot about the world, and she outsmarts most of the world's things. My favorite part was the end of the book, in the email to hazel that Augustus wrote. It made me happy, and glad that the story didn't end in a cheesy way ( such as fast forwarding into the future where the couple gets married and has children together.) And that it actually sounded like a real story. To sum it up, I loved this book. It was funny, sad, and happy all in one. I would suggest this book to teens 13+ (because of the love content)"
4," I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly and then all at once. (125) This, in a nutshell, describes the book for me. I started reading The Fault In Our Stars and then just fell into the story.I honestly read this book after seeing a blurb in Entertainment Weekly about the upcoming movie and thought it sounded interesting. Yeah, interesting. Now that I am able to breathe again, after crying for about 3/4 of the book and well after I finished it, I am finding I have no words to describe the book, except that I loved it, but after saying how it affected me, saying I loved it seems wrong.The story was amazing, it drew me in through my tears and I just kept going. Hazel and Augustus' story was uplifting and heartbreaking. Their connection and Hazel's reaction to it and the subsequent event flowed, as it just broke your heart. This is definitely a must read and has me curious enough to read more of the author's books. The emotion was captured so well, it felt like you were there, going through every step with Hazel, Augustus and Issac through it all."
5," Spoiler Alert....... From an unhappy reader.WTF - this book was terribly unrealistic which I never say cause (eye roll) I like books about vampires .lol. But this was just .... I don't know.The teenagers vocabulary was beyond any normal college graduate. I started off googling the words - always looking to broaden my horizons :*} but it just got to the point that I just assumed what it ment and pretty much skipped over it all.I did like the characters but the way they spoke was just to far fetched. I know poetic ppl are dramatic when they want to make a statement but this was just to a point of being silly , a lot of eye rolls &amp; line skipping.Here's the SPOILER -The book is about two teens feeling disappointed by the ending of a book they both loved - leaving many many unanswered questions.Well when I got to the end of this book I was terribly pissed that that is the same damn thing this book did - it stopped. there was no closure.It never told us how much longer the main girl lived to be. It simply stopped after the boy died. Well I liked her too so I wanted (still want) to know her story till HER ending.But fear not author .lol. I will not write you many letters or email you with my questions. But what I will do is NEVER read one of your books again."
5," had trouble envisioning a book about a teenager with cancer that could work. I was wrong. I laughed while I was crying. I laughed out loud while weeping on my reading device. I had to wipe my eyes to see the print, but i didn't find this book depressing at all. In fact i found it healing. This book is awfully funny while being funny about the awful. This book captures many true things. The isolation of illness, it's petty humiliations, and it's giant ones. The need to be seen that we humans share, the desire to make a difference that some of us have. The desire be remembered. The immediacy of terminal illness. The magic of first love.I could give a plot synopsis, but the discoveries are part of the delight here. Suffice it to say this book is a about a teenage girl with a terminal illness. It doesn't minimize the pain of illness. It manages the incredible by not sentimentalizing it. I don't know if this book is written because of life experience, but it rang true in many ways. This kind of truth does not come cheap.An excellent, exceptional book."
2," When I was 18, my younger sister Jenifer died after a nine-month battle with leukemia. That period of time when she was sick was horrific for the entire family, but especially for Jenifer because the cure rate for leukemia back then was about 30%. Even though she was only 10, she knew she was going to die. This book gets it all right; the fear, the rage, the sad, tragic endings; these all represent what happens in real life when a child has cancer, is unsuccessfully treated, and dies. It's enough to make you want to tear the pages out of the book and light them on fire, as if that would do any good. It was a very hard book for me to read because no one who has seen a child go through this ever recovers from it. But unlike Hazel, I never thought of my sister as the grenade - cancer is the grenade, and when it kills, it scars everyone within range. I loved that Hazel faced her death with such realism, that toward the end she knew the only thing that could be done was to enjoy the time she had left as best she could. It's all any of us can ever do, and so few of us do it."
5," am speechless. It was so beautiful, so hard and so honest. Sometimes it feels like the universe wants to be noticed. I believe that more people will pay attention"
5," So, I'm late to the party on this one, having known about this amazing book for a while, but not getting to it. Until now. And, I'm glad that I did because it is - as others, including the critics and award-givers have said - an amazing portrait of illness. It is truly amazing to me how Mr. Green is able to inhabit the mind and body of a young woman, a woman who has foresight and consciousness about herself, and yet one who - for all her wisdom and remarks - is still very young. I was most taken by the banter between Hazel and Gus, and it reminded me of what it was like to be a teenager (albeit, perhaps not as clever or wise as either of them).But, the portrait that Mr. Green has painted of the two of them, their relationship with each other, and Hazel's with her parents is really great. Typing this, I can still hear the characters, and most of them are telling me that I'm being far to trite, but I'll leave the wonderful dialog to Mr. Green.I only hope that unlike the sad author Van Houten, Mr. Green finds a way to continue with his writing."
5," rate this book a 9 because I am saving my 10. As you can already see I was very touched by this book. ( you will get what I said once you read the book )I am a 13 year old girl who doesn't know most of the big words in this book let alone about love, but I can not explain how deep my love is for this book. Like I said about the big words, I took the time to look up these words to find the real meaning which made me connect more to the book. However, I feel like a big jerk for watching the movie before I read the book, you see, I never really considered myself getting into big popular movies let alone books, but on Father's Day my dad and sister wanted to see the movie so I did, I was so touched and decided to read the book after feeling like a jerk. I recommend this book because it is the definition of life. Sure it is about a teenage girl who has cancer and she deeply falls in love with a boy who's gorgeous in every way but it is so much more then that. It gives the meaning of life. I read this book in a day in a half, I couldn't put it down ! I love it !"
5," first saw this one in the list of Best of January 2012 books sent out by Amazon.  The reviews and description intrigued me right away.  This is a love story between two teens who meet in a cancer support group.  With that kind of synopsis, you know you're going to wind up crying at some point, right?  What you can't expect is how much you're going to enjoy the experience.  It's like watching Steel Magnolias, or Brian's Song, or Love Story.  You boo hoo like it's your own personal tragedy.  Plus, you get to think about LIFE and LOVE (yes, the kind of big thoughts that require all caps.)  At the end, you sigh and wish the book would keep going.  I found myself digging in my bedside table at midnight, looking for a pencil so I could underline passages to read again later.  I quoted whole passages into my Facebook status because they were just too amazing not to share.  I bought two freaking copies of the book so I could shove it into my friends' hands right away!  I just found a new book for my top five of my life list.  What else can I say?  Go read it."
5," My title isn't about Gus and hazel. Its about how I'm just in love with John green right now. This is by far my favorite book. EVER!!!!  After reading the sample, I knew I would love it,  And I am not ashamed that I bought this book without my mom's permission. Though I know I should be I just can't bring myself to be. I was crying my butt off a lot and I sort of hated the book for being so sad. But that was also why I loved it. Quoting the book  without pain you will not now joy. At least something along those lines. I also loved the complexity of the book. I constantly had to highlight words for the definitions and then I still had to figure the sentence out. I didn't hate that though, I loved that. I believe only the really good books make you have a headache and get your brain moving. Like hazel, I wish I could meet John, but the world is not a wish granting factory.  By the way, if you believe it, i m actually just thirteen like five days ago. Sometime I feel like I'm thirteen going on thirty. Thanks John for expanding my vocabulary.  Morgan wilsdon"
5," Hazel has been sick for a long time with thyroid cancer that has now spread to her lungs. With constant doctor visits and re-reading her favorite book, Hazel has gotten her life sorted out. But then she meets Augustus (Gus) Waters, a handsome boy that goes one day to her Support Group. From there, it's a whirlwind adventure as Augustus and Hazel get to know each other, become international travelers, and fall in love.As with what seems like a majority of the entire universe, I love this book. It's a very witty and realistic story about two kids fighting together to add more time so they can do things such as fall in love and meet their heroes. This book is highly recommended ONLY if a box of facial tissue is nearby. Trust me, you'll need it.Also, on a side note, I love the fact that this book takes place in Indianapolis and that a local author has gotten so much publicity and praise for his great book. Indy is a great place to grow up, and it's nice to see it get some fame and attention from something other than the Indy 500.*5 STARS*[...]"
5,"f this was on Twitter I'd say: #NoSpoilersHereThis book quickly became one of my favorites. It has a sense of realism in the way the characters are portrayed that many movies, much less books, achieve. The main character, Hazel Grace Lancaster, battles her lung disease in a way that seems a bit like someone I know in real life, albeit with a bit more attitude.The one part I really like is that both before and after the story John Green states that it is a work of fiction. It helps you realize that you can hate certain characters without having to feel guilty about hating them and that you can love certain characters and imagine what life would be like for them if things were different. Green's slightly sarcastic attitude that's evident in his videos comes through in this book.I've said it before, about this and other stuff, if it doesn't make you at least want to cry, you might not have a pulse, but the story isn't completely depressing, it has its fun moments as well as its serious moments. The book does remind us that pain deserves to be felt."
5," can't even write a proper review of this book because nothing I will ever say can properly express just how much this book touched my heart.First off, I hate, absolutely hate, sad books. My friend begged me to read this book and I almost didn't do it because I saw it was a Cancer book and so I knew it was going to be a sad book and therefore I wanted to avoid it at all costs.I was right, of course. It's a sad book. But it's also a happy book. And I'm so glad I read it. I loved getting to see Hazel and Gus's world, even though their infinity was shorter than most. It was still more beautiful than some people ever get.If you want a book that will make you question life and death and really see things differently and start thinking about things in philosophical ways, then read this book.This book was fantastic. An absolute instant classic. I don't care if there were technical things wrong with the story that other reviewers might see, just focus on the story.It's a meaningfully beautiful story."
5," When I picked up this book I was thinking that this might be okay. I read it in less than 24 hours ( I'm a slow reader, forgive me.) and was taken aback by it. I was amazed by the detail and how much it resembled some teenagers. The book was filled with philosophical, funny, sassy, cry-worthy quotes that would leave my with a pen and paper writing them down and saving them. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone, even if you do not like Fiction books or any type of book like this. Now I know what you're thinking, This is a book about cancer, I'm going to be depressed if I read it. Well hey, guess what? You'll be crying by the end, but you will also laugh along the way. Within the first 5 pages I was already smirking. This was a very good read, I would read it again, which I never do with books. This book changed the way I thought about people with cancer, and made me realize that not all people want to be treated like the most important ever. As I said before. Well worth the money. Well? What are you waiting for? Scroll up and buy it!"
2," loved this book, it blew me away. It was not your typical Walk to Remember type cancer book. The book wasn't even about cancer, or death, or living even. It was a story about two kids and their place in this world.The story line was a little cliche and predictable, but he made it work. He threw in plenty of intelligent humor, heart-wrenching moments, and philosophical conversations.The characters were strong and interesting. They were highly intellectual, sometimes unrealistically so, but it added depth to their character and made it easier to become attached to them. Their words and their thoughts were thought-provoking. Though I feel he emphasized the two main characters too much and every other character fell by the wayside as a sort of filler character.Overall I really enjoyed this book. It was a book that was entertaining, easy to read, but required you to think and inspired you to action. What that action is, I'm not sure yet, but I want to do something. This was awesome book, and I would recommend it to everyone."
5," This book was so absolutely FANTASTIC that I am at a loss for words. I'm SO glad it was selected for my bookclub to read! The writing was absolutely beautiful (for lack of a better word), yet the story, dialogue and character development flowed so naturally and totally pulled you into these young people's world. The writing was never pretentious, but it was sometimes humorous (despite involving the subject of cancer and young people!), often thought provoking, and always, ALWAYS captivating. As an older woman who lost her husband to cancer several years ago, I initially thought this book might be too difficult emotionally for me to read. NOT SO!!! I actually found it quite cathartic in a way I can't quite define. This is a book for teenagers and adults alike. Like another reviewer (Alex F, I believe) commented, unless you have a heart of stone, you will LOVE this book. Please do yourself a favor and read it IMMEDIATELY!! Now, I'm going to check out some other books by this author. If they can hold a candle to this one, I'm a fan for life!"
5," chose this book for our book club's March read.  We have read other teen  books and have thoroughly enjoyed them.  Always great conversations.  However, I think this book will  be one of our highest rated teen reads as well as a great adult read.  Too often books are labeled for a particular audience and too often we as adult miss great works because they are labeled teen.  This is a book not to be missed by adults!!!!  If possible take that label off it.Anyone who has cancer, is the caregiver for a person with cancer, a survivor of cancer, or who has a chronic illness should read this book. It provides a look into the thoughts of those with cancer and how we experience our disease and the world.  It provides hope, a reason to live each day to the fullest because if we don't we miss out on life.  And the disease wins.  It reminds us that we are still a person; we are not our disease.I look forward to our conversation at Book Club on 4/12.  It will be lively."
5, paid 9.99 for this book. I had to make my self read it . I keep thinking it was going to get better.it  went on and on about the games they played and things that had nothing to do with the book.
5," This book made me laugh, cry and touched my heart. John Green brings these beautiful characters to life to share their experience in a raw and passionate way."
2," Sweet story, but way too heavy-handed. Just not a great book. A quick and easy read, though. I don't regret reading it but I'm glad I don't own a print copy."
5," Very good book. Every character is just perfect. In most books, the boy of whom the  main character loves is usually....perfect. smart, popular, attractive, funny, nice...healthy. Downright perfect. But Augustus is not perfect. I liked this, because in reality, no one  is perfect.I love the literature references and allusions, mainly because love reading and writing and I hope to be like a Hazel Lancaster, who can quote books and recite poetry.This books was truly touching. I am a movie/book cryer, but this one made me bawl. It captures the perfect image of cancer survivors, and those who don't survive. Hazel Grace' s thoughts made so much sense, as if they were coming from someone who truly did fight lung cancer.In conclusion, this book is definitely a 5-star must-read. Of all the books I've read, this one has left me at a loss for words the most. There are no words in my vocabulary , almost, that could describe this book. I hope this review turns you into the right direction."
2," realize it's only February, but this is my favorite book of the year. Now is it right to declare it the BEST book of the year before I've read all the future books from now until December 31st? Quite possibly. Why? John Green gutted me with this one. I used to watch my grandmother slice the catch at the lake for dinner. I thought, a) wow, you stink, fish and b) poor fish, I'm sorry you're going to go in my belly and I don't even like you, even while covered in tartar sauce. For me, there is a literary equivalent to that poor fish - when I've read a book that turns me inside out. John made me laugh in one paragraph and cry in the next. I can't tell you how many times I yelled, oh, no! in the book or had to set it down for a few seconds to gather my bearings - or blow my nose - before being able to read the next sentence. I'm pleased the book will be made into the movie and I hope Hollywood does it justice. These kids deserve the best. And, John, you deserve all these five stars and more. lit love to you, sir"
5," The story itself was sweet and sad and something that I will remember for years to come. However the way that Green portrays any of the characters is somewhat offensive. Being a teenager, most of my friends were reading it so I decided to read it. However while reading it I realized that this is how adults view us teenagers. As extremely sex driven. Kaitlyn, Isaac, Gus, and Hazel are the only teenage characters we really meet and all of those make extreme sexual comments or have sex during the novel. Being a teenage girl I find it quite offensive that the author believes us teenagers have no self control what so ever and depicts us as very dirty minded. Greene is helping the to cement the lie that all teenagers are powered by their hormones and have sex.  Besides that point, the entire character of Augustus is extremely unbelievable and that guy would never come into reality. While the plot is sweet the characters themselves and how the teenage generation gets depicted, it is a very sweet and sad book."
5," Man, I can't say I liked it, I have to say I LOVED it. The whole book is like a long mantra, it has a bunch of little phrases that show you the meaning of everything. The book doesn't show an opinion...it shows you the truth (and that's an option in itself). You read this book, and you hope, you truly hope that this story isn't just a fiction book: one that you can read, and just put up on the shelf. You hope it isn't just over. But as TFIOS says: you die in the middle of a sentence, or a paragraph, or a book; like in AIA. After a while, you expect to lose your sense of emotion-ness when you retread a book. That is a complete misconception. My theory is: after you've read a book twice, ten times, twenty times, if you still get that feeling of heartache, that feeling of joy, if you still cry (not even at the very end, but in the middle, because you know the characters's happiness only lasts so long), then you know, you know that book is THE book.The book you remember forever."
2,"t's not hard to see why a certain subgroup of readers went bananas over this book, but it perplexes me how otherwise sensible adults seem to have lost their heads in droves. The plot is fanciful, not ridiculous but not entirely credible either; I couldn't tell whether it wanted to be. Likewise the characters were a little bit fantastic, a tiny little bit real (well, not all of them), and mostly a sort of unbelievable hybrid. Worst, I think, was the synthetic, superficial emotional tone of the novel. Adolescents are more passionate, dramatic, and volatile in the face of bad hair days and unfair tests than these seemed to be who confronted mortality, disability, real hopelessness, and wrenching choices about how to allocate their time and attentions. Flippant attitudes and language may well serve as an attempt to disguise fear and frustration, but not 24/7. I was left with the feeling that Mr. Green didn't know or didn't want his readers to know about the iceberg below the adorable tip."
5," My fellow human beings, The main argument I'm seeing against this amazing peice of literature is that the vocabulary is unrealistic for teenagers or unrelatable to adolecents I however belive that we must examine the people who this book is marketed to, who it was written for, the nerdfighters. These are people who have words like monotonous and lacerate in their everyday vocabulary. These are people who understand the power of a well-worded metaphor. The interesting conversationalists. The smart ones. The ones who make great friends and wait for several minutes trying to think of the perfectly selected word. The ones that fear oblivion, the ones that think fearing oblivion is ridiculous, the ones who do both. The ones who read books and watch videos that encourage them to be intelligent. The nerdfighters. thank you John. Thank you Hank. And thank the entire nerdfighter community. I love you guys.Sincerly, nerdfighter forever, MiaDFTBA"
4," When I was 14 I read J.D. Salinger's Catcher in the Rye for the very first time. Naturally, I really did not care for it. (What teenager would?) Early on in college, I read it again. It was better the second time. Some time after college, I read it again. Now, I had begun to be mesmerized by it.The fourth time was in my 30s and I suddenly understood the entire book was told in a single breath. While I have not read it again (yet), I think on this singularly spectacular piece of writing often.Imaginably, John Greene's The Fault in Our Stars will have a similar effect on readers young enough to be beginning their reading careers but mature enough to already love narrative. Also Imaginably, it will challenge young readers, charm them, and beguile them into reading still more. Best of all, when they are older still and happen to re-read The Fault in Our Stars, it is likely they will discover it to be the sort of book that gets better as we do.Required reading."
5," bought this book on the day I purchased my Kindle. I thought a five star book with 16,000 reviews was a safe bet for a good book.I'm not a fast reader but I finished this book in two days. At the start I thought I had failed in the choice of my first book, but I was determined to see it through. Half-way through the book I was hooked.I'm a 20 year old male, the last time I cried was when I was 17, drunk, and freshly broken hearted. Regardless of my emotional stability (when sober) I enjoyed the emotional roller coaster, I'm not afraid to admit I cried solidly for about 20% of this book. And I mean it, I enjoyed that roller coaster of emotion, I enjoyed the beautiful story and I feel like I've grown as a person feeling like a fool for not appreciating the life I've been blessed with. I'm going to be selective of who I see the movie with, because the chances are it will probably reopen my fresh wound and leave me choking back silent tears.Thank you John Green."
5," absolutely LOVED the book. i've read so many books over the years andthis is my favorite and I cried through out the book and it just helped me understand so many concepts of world. I loved it. There isn't just a book that tells you a story and shows how people went through something...it goes beyond the meaning of just a book. It creates a whole new perspective and it just exceeds the definition of a book I wish there were more books out there. The way the story stars and the non-chalant way the story continues but with so much depth at the same time is just so amazing to me. John Green really out did himself this time and I wish his work was more recognized. I wish I could just read it all over again. Sometimes you come across books that you want to quote out of, because those quotes speak to you but this book..this is the first time I've felt like I could quote the entire book. Its beautiful. Its versatile. Its..close to perfection. For me, its perfection. I love love love LOVED it."
5," From the first paragraph this book pulled me in, broke my heart and left me simultaneously emotionally spent and spiritually renewed. The book is as predictable as you might expect about two teenagers with cancer - one dies and it is devastating - but the writing is so personal and credible that you can't help but give yourself over to the story. I wanted so much for these two kids to live. I could see everything before them that they would never experience! Yet their humor and resilience, and their simple normalness as teenagers....these are the things that drew me most strongly towards these kids. And the adults in the book - especially the parents - all added to the storyline and depth. As an adult woman with a teen daughter, I loved this book. Liz got a copy in her stocking from Santa (he is avid reader as well!) and I am sure (like me) within a few days she will be crying on the couch as she reads the last few wrenching pages of this beautiful, sad and ultimately inspiring love story."
5," Few authors remember well the confusion of being a teen ager, of trying to find out who/what you are to you and the rest of the world. I'm 27 and while I stopped being a teenager some time ago, I love how John's writing not only makes you love/root for his characters, but also the way he makes us see through his characters in a way that makes teenagers say this guy 'gets' me and us older folk say yeah, I remember this. This is EXACTLY how it feels.TFIOS is a novel that although 'involves' people with cancer, it's more about the people than the cancer. Yes, they have to cope with that, but its not about the great fight or courage against adversity it's about Hazel, and her life. Not her illness, but her life.People with cancer and other types of sickness, often *become* their sickness, making their life exist around the fact that they are sick. And John does not allow Hazel to become one of those.Believe me, you REALLY want to read this book.And don't forget to be awesome!"
5," Granted, this is a surprisingly funny and uplifting story, considering it centers around two teenagers with cancer who meet in a support group and fall in love. And there were numerous times I laughed out loud. It is so smartly written, making you think about things just a little while thoroughly entertaining you the entire way. But it is also the only book I can ever remember that made me sob out loud, uncontrollably, and more than once. (Thank God I was alone.) Of course, part of it is that the lead boy's name is Gus, same as my 5-year old, who is blessedly healthy... something I am emphatically more grateful for after reading this gem of a novel. But it is also so honest and raw and beautiful and gut-wrenching and inspiring and yes, very, very funny. It is technically considered a Young Adult novel, and all I can say is we are so lucky to have authors like John Green writing such exquisite books for our children to read. But make no mistake, this book is for any lover of literature."
5," This is a great book for anyone to read and also is a New York Times #1 best seller. But besides holding that title I can tell this book has something VERY special about it. This book isn't a perfect love story you hope for at most times, but holds a universal message. The whole idea of Augustus and Hazel falling in love was that Great pain needs to be felt. It's the imperfectness of them two that bring them together. Hazel says, quote I believe the universe wants to be noticed. It junk the universe is improbably biased toward the consciousness, that it rewards intelligence in part because the universe enjoys its elegance being observed... she feels like she is in the middle of it. This book will reveal what that means and how she sees her life through the universe. This is simply not a cancer book looking for human self pity... READ IT!!! John Green made this book nothing short from perfection and catches the eyes and heart of each individual reader In their own special way..."
5," First off, I should point out that I am twenty-four years old and I therefore do not fit into the typical young adult reader category.  But that is one of the beautiful things about this book, as well as John Green's other books - age does not particularly matter.  The themes explored in this novel - love, friendship, illness, grief, the desire for meaning - are all universal, so I can say with a great deal of certainty that anyone at any stage in their life can appreciate this story and these characters.This story is not about cancer.  Above everything else, it is a love story and it is filled with Green's celebrated profundity and heart.  The imagery is so powerful that, by the end, I felt that I had intimately known these people, and greatly wished that I did.  It is a book that I, and I'm sure many others, will be rereading and rerereading, etc, because it left me wanting to see more adventures with Hazel and to get lost in Augustus's goofy smile for just a little longer."
2," Reading this book was the best 4 hours I have spent in a very long time. John Green’s words brought Hazel and Augustus into my heart. They managed to heal it and break it all at once, and I’d go through it all again, quite willingly.People just don’t write about cancer kids in the way he did, and their teenaged voices were authentic enough to make me slip back into the skin I wore twenty years ago. Adults have been underestimating the intelligence and language skills of teenagers forever, especially the ones who faced things that made them grow up faster than is natural. They were my friends, and I was in for the long haul. I didn’t want to leave them, no matter how uncomfortable the ride got.He also got love right. The love of friends, family, and lovers. It was all so right.This is the kind of book you insist your friends read, and they thank you when they’re done but there’s nothing more to say because it’s THAT perfect. It is that special."
5," purchased this book a few months ago but put off reading because I knew it was going to be relatively sad! John Green did an amazing job bringing the characters to life, even the minor characters had great development. I also enjoyed how well thought out the seriousness of young love was depicted. I gave this book 5 stars because it was great writing, an easy read, and had one of the best story lines I've read in awhile. Highly recommend if you don't mind shedding a few tears throughout the book.I see people complaining about the characters not acting like regular teenagers. I think it's important to remember they are not regular teenagers, they are teens staring death in the face on a daily basis. Hazel also is enrolled in college at the age of 16, I think her behavior is appropriate under the circumstances. They also spend a lot of time playing video games, if that doesn't say teenager then clearly people only have stereotyped ideas of what a teen should be."
5," John Green has captured something here. Something unique. From the moment you dive into the world of Hazel Lancaster, it's hard not to feel what she is feeling. That, to me, is the mark of great fiction - when the reader so thoroughly disconnects from their own reality, that they cannot help but adapt the reality of the character in front of them. Green manages this phenomenon through raw emotion, relatable dialogue, and what I can only describe as one of the most beautiful tragic twists in recent young adult fiction.Admittedly, there are a few points that are a bit campy, and there are some segments that feel emotional for the sake of emotion. However, Green remains true to his genre through and through, and it is hard not to appreciate that. This is a grand and masterful (and also heart-rending and solemn) tale for a more modern generation of readers. It is a great balance of raw, blunt honesty and warm, poignant story-telling.Definitely worth a read!"
5," You told me this was a great read, but I ignored you, thinking John Green was just another author of Sad Teenager Stories.I was wrong.The Fault in Our Stories is the story of a sixteen-year-old girl, Hazel, who has been dying of cancer for the last three years. Her mother forces her to get up out of bed and socialize, and, in this quest to help her shake off depression, she takes her to a Cancer Support Group.And there Hazel meets the oh-so-handsome Augustus Waters. He, too, has been fighting cancer, with one of his legs lost in his battle.Hazel and Augustus talk books which leads them off on a wild trip to meet the world's worst behaved author, all the way in the Netherlands.I was right, too, though; this book is a Sad Teenager Story. But, oddly, it is also a Happy Teenager Story, and that mix, plus the wonderful characters of Hazel and Augustus and, yes, even the Awful Author, you will want to meet make it a must-read."
4," This is my first John Green read. I loved this book! I especially like the style of writing the author has. Unfortunately I've seen my share of cancer patients, both terminal and curable, and this account of their struggle is pretty accurate. I loved the sarcasm and the humour. The love story was there, but it wasn't in your face like most love stories are. I like that he explained things quickly and didn't spend too much time on a description of what something looked like, but you still got a good picture in your mind of what he was describing.My only complaint was the language and vocabulary these teenagers used on a daily basis. That is the only thing I didn't find very believable. Everything else in the story was plausible down to the Make A Wish Foundation wish granting.I found myself seriously laughing out loud and crying and reading lines aloud to my husband so he could share my experience, which I almost never do.all in all, a very good read!!"
5," had downloaded this book a while ago and couldn't remember what it was all about.  This was one of the rare times that I just started reading without knowing what type of story it would be (chick lit, non-fiction, drama, mystery).  From the first page it grabbed me and didn't let me go until I finished it within the day.  Make no mistake - it is sad and gripping, and very, very real.  The story is about life and death and all the struggles in between from the perspective of teenagers that are facing death way sooner than they should have to face it.  It was beautifully written, funny (laughed out loud several times), poignant, romantic, truthful and sad all wrapped in one wonderful package.  It is a book that you will remember and will think about for a long time to come.  It is one I will always remember because it grips you and makes you THINK, where so many books do not.  If you want a book that will leave its mark on you, this is one that will beautifully touch you."
5," Wow, to describe this book is nearly impossible. There is no doubt that John Green is a gifted writer.You will laugh, you will cry and you'll repeat it again and again. You will not be able this book down after reading the first chapter. I read the book in one day. And I will read it again. My favorite scene... when Hazel Grace revealed her Disney's Wish to her friend, Augustus Waters. I laughed and laughed.Hazel Grace &amp; Augustus Waters are unforgetable characters and you will enjoy watching their friendship grow from the staring contest at their first meeting and you will stay with them until the end of their story. And what and ending it was. It it utterly unforgetable. I can see why this book was the #1 New York Times Besteller in 2012.I hope the passage below from John Green's book will encourage you to read it :)Gus's father: Our children are weird.My dad: Nicely phrased.~ from the Fault in Our Stars."
5," have never written a book review before, but I knew before I was finished reading it that I HAD to write one for this story.This is truly one of, if not the most, wonderfully written stories I have had the pleasure to read.  It captivated me from the moment I started reading it and held me the whole time.I do not want to give away any of the story, but I do not believe there is a soul alive who could read this and not feel for Hazel and Augustus.It isn't often while reading you find yourself sobbing so hard for the characters, and then unexpectedly laughing through your tears. This story, and the characters, are so honest and real, and I cannot express how much I love love love this story!It isn't just a love story, or just a sad story, or just a tragedy, or just any one thing at all.  It's some of everything that comes in life, and that includes humor in the face of death. Please read it, as I am probably going to immediately do again myself!"
5," John Green is an astute observer of humankind. He composes symphonies with his words. Often when I listen to Mozart or Beethoven I realise that each note they wrote for a particular piece of music is essential, has a function and without that one note the music would be all wrong.John Green's writing evokes in me a similar understanding: every syllable on every page is essential to the story. In many places I have felt that the book is profound. I am not normally a hunter and gatherer of 'quotable quotes' yet in this book I felt compelled to highlight. There are so many passages that one wants to read and reread until they become a part of your being.This book is not for the fainthearted - I have been avoiding it for a while because I was initially not brave enough, now I am sad that I did not read it sooner. I highly recommend that you do read this splendid book.Well done John Green! I am looking forward to reading your other works."
5, Ok so I got this book because everywhere I turned this book was popping up and it got phenomenal reviews on amazon and was all over Barnes and noble etc etc.  Normally when a book is as hyped up as this one is it does not disappoint.  Well this book is the exact opposite.  I'm the type of reader that flies through six hundred/ seven hundred page books without a problem and I enjoy books with substance which I figured this book would have.  I have been reading this book for three weeks now and it does not seem to end.  This book is so awfully boring plus I guessed what happened before getting to the end.  Nothing really happens in this book it's just a day by day count of totally unbelievable teenage characters.  No teenager I know talks or thinks the way these kids do (well maybe hipsters) but whatever.  This book really disappointed me.  I was expecting this great emotional roller coaster ride of not being able to put this book down and all I felt was blah is the chapter over yet?  I'm just highly disappointed by a day by day encounter of two teenagers.
2," Absolutely fantastic read. This novel is painful: I literally cried -sobbed- through the entire last third of the book. It is hilarious: It is carefully lined with witty conversation and a touch of almost inappropriate humor that only John Green could master. And it contains possibly the most beautiful love story I have ever read: Hazel and Augustus are absolutely perfect in way that you must read and experience for yourself.This is my favorite John Green book I have read largely because of the way that he captures the depth of human emotion (as evidenced by all of the crying and the literal laughing out loud at times) and the fact that it has a fantastic plot that is never dull for a moment.Finally, this book will force you to think about the size and importance of the human life in terms of what you can/will/expect to accomplish during your lifetime, how you will be remembered, and how much this matters.I highly recommend it."
2," There are probably not enough words available to put into spacial elements of how truly wonderful this book is. It's a book that will have you laughing and crying at the same time, and bring you into the very real world of young people, dealing with something, no young person should need or have to experience. These characters are so well-thought out, that I feel if I were a teen dealing with such tribulations, I feel as though, Id probably have the same aspects and views. Hazel &amp; Gus' story is so moving and guttural that I felt like if their story was told in any other way, or shown in any other light that it would not do enough justice to who they were, it would feel wrong. I feel as though, we shouldn't take what we have for granted, and even though these kids were sick, they made the best of what they had, which so often, we forget to do. I adored this book and anyone that knows about living should read this book to get a refreshing view on dying and on love."
5," This is easily one of the most beautiful and powerful works of literature your eyes will ever transmit o your brain for processing and comprehension. The Fault In Our Stars is a blinding story of star-crossed love that takes the preconceived notions of young adult novels, and kicks them in the face. It goes on to completely seduce you, amaze you, and (once you know that you are totally in love with the sudden love story of the main characters) smash your heart into innumerable pieces that you know you will never truly be able to put back together. It simply has no choice but to destroy you emotionally in the best way possible. It takes a moment to fall in love with this book, a night to finish it, and several lifetimes to recover from the beauty and tragedy. You simply have to read it,and finish until the bitter end, for it will enlighten you, and show the true depth of teenagers, the terminal cases, and those who are left behind when the grenade finally blows."
5,"ve had this book in my cue for months just not ready to dive into something so heavy just yet. I will go ahead and say that I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED it.John Green made it so easy to connect with all of his characters. Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters are now my two favorites and I don't think I will ever forget about them. It was ridiculous how much I fell in love with these two. Hazel was especially funny even when she wasn't trying to be. Augustus was all kinds of sexy; the kid is well beyond his years.I honestly knew I was going to love this book a couple of pages in. I laughed at the awesomeness that was Hazel Grace, Isaac and Augustus. I also cried for about 4 chapters straight (probably more). At the end I wanted to get all Hazel Grace and contact John Green with some questions I felt like he needed to answer :).Overall GREAT book that I will no doubt have to read again. The Fault in Our Stars is top 3 for me for sure."
5," Absolutely fabulous. THis book will capture you, entertain you, and break your heart before you know it. This book is John Green at his best, with each sentence beautifully crafted. Opening this book is like opening a door to another reality with people so real you feel as though you could touch them. A shocking portrayal of the effects of cancer as told from the eyes of a dying teenage girl. Although a morbid topic, you'll be too caught up in your love for the characters that you wont notice your heart break.An instant classic to be read many more times than one, and shared as much as possible. This book's quality makes it instantly clear that green spent years crafting it. It's a #1 New York Times Bestseller for a reason: people love it. I picked it up and didnt put it down until i read it all, then I read it again.This book will be enjoyed for many, many, MANY years to come and this work only leaves me more excited for his next book. BUY THIS BOOK."
5," This book is amazing and terrible at the same time. I can't decide whether to rate it 5 stars or 1, or if I should recommend that others read it too.I am a 21 year old male, and I take pride in the fact that I can generally suck it up when it comes to really sad things. I've seen Where the Red Fern Grows, Toy Story 3, Old Yeller, etc., multiple times and have never shed a tear. This book made me bawl like a baby. You fall in love with the characters and their story, and even when you brace yourself for the worst it still isn't enough for when the worst comes to fruition. Every chapter and every word keeps you hooked and wanting more. I downloaded the book and started reading at 9 PM one evening and I finished it in one sitting, at close to 2 AM, with tears streaming down my face.Read at your own risk. This book will be one of the most memorable ones you will ever read, but whether or not that's a good thing is up to you."
5," This is different from other cancer stories. The reader does not ghoulishly stand by looking on as a family and team of doctors are defeated by the disease. The story is about a cancer victim in these stories, to be sure, but it is not the victim's voice and -- strangely -- not his/her story.This story is in the voices of two young people, each stricken with different cancers. We meet their families but what their families are going through and what they learn from the ordeal never takes over the story. We hear about experimental treatments given as a last resort that just might help, but, again the medical drama doesn't take over.Green makes the voices ring true and the events believable. You care about the characters in this cancer story not because it is so tragic and so much to ask any victim / family member / doctor to endure like most cancer stories. In this one, you care about the characters because you identify with them."
5," Although I eventually liked this book, it had a very slow start.  It wasn't until about half-way through the book that it began to get interesting."
5," Let me start by saying that I am 28. While this book was downloading, I started reading the reviews and became disheartened by how many really terrible reviews there were. So I waited to read the book for a couple of weeks and when I picked it up, I started watching for all the problems other reviewers pointed out. I couldn't see them and certainly couldn't understand why anyone would have hated it so vehemently as some reviewers seemed to.The attitude and demeanor of the two main characters have been criticized as snarky and temperamental, but I found them to be no more so than normal teenagers and at times, they seemed more mature than I would have expected.I found the characters intriguing and their love story very sweet and touching. I laughed at parts and the cried moments later and that is pretty amazing. I love finding characters that I become so emotionally connected to and this book definitely provided that connection."
5, This book is a wonderful insight into the world of a cancer patient.  Haze Grace Lancaster has a tumor in her lungs and is terminally ill. Augustus had cancer and now has a prosthetic leg. He wants nothing more than to leave his mark on the world and that he does on Hazel Grace 's heart.The book has some ups and downs. I highly suggest that you do not read this book in front of people if you have a tendency to get emotional while reading a sad book. As I have learned while reading The Fault in Our Stars. Amazing for young adults but not for twelve year olds. A twelve year old might not understand the sadness you go through when losing a loved one.I read this to more deeply understand the agony and sorrow of cancer and how bad this is for many people who have lost someone to cancer.  My friend recently battled Leukemia last year ending up in the ICU quite frequently during this battle.  I hope you realize how precious life is.
2," Simply brilliant! when I began the book, I expected it to be painful &amp; just sad. I delayed reading it for weeks even after my niece insisted I read it. I won't lie, I didn't cry for the first half of the book, but the last half ripped me open, and I found myself sobbing for the pain these characters experience. I adored Hazel &amp; Augustus, they are written intelligently and compassionately. And the story takes turns that are so unexpected &amp; raw. The description of the book tells you that the main character Hazel is terminal so you don't expect happily ever after. But I did not expect the turns in the story that happened. This is the kind of book that makes you examine your life, your beliefs &amp; will stay with you forever. This is the first John Green book I have read, I plan on reading more. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for an honest &amp; emotional story. Life isn't always fair &amp; there isn't always a happily ever after...it is just real."
5," always thought that John Green was one of the most brilliant writers of all time...maybe not of all time, but pretty darned close.  The Fault in Our Stars only confirmed it.  As other reviewers, I laughed, I cried.  This is unlike any other book that I've read of John Green's.  I love his writing style because he adds an honest approach, but with humor and a little adventure.  They all feel a little off-kilter, but in a good way.  I was entirely engrossed in this book until I finished it because I absolutely had to know what happens at the end.  And yet, I still can't seem to get it that the story has ended.  I may have to read it again right away to feel like it's not over.  Which is exactly how I feel everytime I finish one of Mr. Green's books.  John Green, if you ever read your Amazonian reviews, that is a great compliment to you.  This is not an easy book to review simply because it is not a typical read.  All I can say is that it's just wow."
5," have completed this book for the second time. This is that kind of book that makes you want to re-read and re-read, you never get tired. I usually go for the action boos like Divergent or Hunger Games or Harry Potter, but this is a nice change, a pleasant one. It's a love story but not a traditional live story. I am currently working on a book that will probably never be published and I will never be know, but this book has changed my point of view of writing. Even though I am unknown to most of the world and will probably remain unknown, this book has helped me so much, on how to sound smarter even in life. This is truly a great book, my favorite even. I enjoyed reading this book so much, I could not put it down. I even got in trouble a couple times for reading when I was not supposed to be reading but it was well worth it. Thank you, John Green for writing such an amazing and lovely story that the whole world should, in my opinion, be reading."
5," This book hardly needs talking about. Certainly no summary is needed. Despite the hype and the accolades, I'm still not sure I understand the appeal here. Like every other John Green book there are overly intellectual characters pondering the universe and trying to find meaning in it. Because these characters both have cancer there is also the inevitable pall of death hanging over the novel.The story is interesting in its own way. There is a fun thread about loving, truly loving a book. There is romance. There are grand gestures. There are also unconvincingly intellectual teens who are shockingly self-aware (which, I feel, is likely not a side effect of dying no matter how literary a book it might make).I'm just not sure why all of that added up to making this book a huge phenomenon. Maybe that's my fault. Maybe it's because the hospital scenes and the illness hit too close to home. Maybe it's because I really hated that Isaac is blind for most of the novel but is never shown learning to use a cane or travel on his own.This book sells itself and you've probably already read it. If you have, maybe you can explain the appeal to me."
5," ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS BOOK! I came into reading this book knowing that I would be crying my eyes off and that is what I did exactly. I always warn my friends before they read this book that it will get very emotional. At the end of each chapter I was always in tears, but not only because the story is sad, but that John Green wrote in a way that made me feel like I was reading a friend's journey through cancer. I thought the characters were beautifully written as well as the entire book. I had multiple moments where I laughed out loud because the main characters were so witty and love-able. They felt like real people when John Green wrote about them and that made me love this book even more because although I am not going through the same thing as they were, I felt relatable to them. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and it has definitely become one of my all time favorite books. One of the few books I have read that made me really appreciate life."
2," This book was recommended by a friend that usually has a great sense for books. She failed on this one, and this book failed to resonate with me. The characters were one note. Despite the protestations of several of them (something like I am not cancer; I am not my disease), this book became only about cancer, and not about or using character, plot, or a dozen other things that make a book worth reading. At one point, I became confused over who was speaking as the characters repeat the same things; the lines between them became blurred to the point that I was bored and restless. It was like reading through one long sermon about how people with cancer should really feel. And nothing happens. Oh, they DO things, but nothing happens. There is no growth, no movement, nothing. To make matters worse, it has the silly and juvenile sense of love from Twilight and the true, but depressingly fated, WE-WILL-ALL-DIE mantra from a really bad Nicholas Sparks' book. Read it if you want to stay up on trendy books. Skip it if you want to read something entertaining or want to be challenged to consider life, or anything for that matter, differently."
5," Because The Fault in our Stars received such rave reviews, I had high expectations. Unfortunately, it fell short for me. The characters are painfully unconvincing - mature WAY beyond their years. Where were the tell-tale signs of youth: social awkwardness, cultural ineptitude... even feigned innocence? Instead, the conversations between the star-crossed lovers felt contrived, as if every utterance of a 16-year-old is thought-provoking. It seemed as though the author decided that as long as he threw in a few whatevers, he could capture teen spirit. Personally, I believe teens (even the gifted ones) generally have a more myopic view of life.I understand that Green is an author who demands intelligence from his young adult readers, but in my humble opinion, that still could've been accomplished with hints of extemporaneous dialogue thrown in.Furthermore, the plot was sadly predictable and lacked depth."
1," This book was a very moving yet a truthful and teaching piece of literature. It taught us what life is worth and to live it while we can. To me this book showed what we can do as individuals and what we can do as a whole. I feel like I connected to this book and understood about everything that they said about anything. When I first heard of this book I wanted to read just to read it. After reading it, I would tell anyone  an  everyone  to read this because it shows us (the incredibly stupid human race) what life is worth. Just because you are disabled and can't to EVERYTHING doesn't mean you can't do SOMETHING. I know saying that I felt connected to this book is stupid because I have never had cancer and don't want to, but I just feel something I can't explain , I am a happy healthy 12 year old and hope to stay this way. This book opened my eyes and is helping me see clearer. The Fault in Our Stars is more  than fantastic, it is inspiring!"
2," am speechless- which is seriously pathetic because John Green has seriously- see I'm not even making sense.This book- this book is my everything.And I absolutely HATE sickness books. With all my heart.But this book, John Green's gift to me, this was such an eye opener and I am so grateful he took the time (such a long, long time) to write such wonderful wonderfuls.Oh, and he also signed my god damned book.His pensive thoughts have certainly been expressed throughout the book and I felt as if I have gotten to know John's deep side.You wouldn't tell that the guy who smeared peanut butter on his face for fun would write such wonderful wonderfuls.Right- well, this reveiw sucked, and I can't exactly pour my heart and soul into a review, so you're just going to have to read it yourself.John, you good hearted bastard, thank you for the best book I have ever read this year (I read lots of books, and I know it's only January)."
5," loved this book for its harsh and unbridled honesty that most works of fiction don't give you, but to me this book isn't fiction and Augustus and Hazel live on forever in the limited infinity that is my heart and soul. This book has brought me infinite turmoil like no other, but has also taught me so many valuable lessons. One being that fighting cancer isn't as courageous as some make it out to be, they fight simply because this is what life has given them. Secondly that life is not a wish-granting factory as many hope it to be. Life is cruel and unfair but as once stated without pain one cannot understand joy and lastly that the faults of life is not in our stars but in ourselves and how we choose to view and react to situations much out of our control. While this book will emotionally scar you, it is the best work do art I have ever witnessed and if you have not read it, you have to or your life will forever be incomplete"
2," Book #10 Read in 2013The Fault in Our Stars by John Green (YA)I knew this was a cancer book.  I knew it would be an emotional read.  What I didn't know was that I would love Hazel and Gus so much.  These two were great characters.  The pair meet at a cancer support group.  Havel has cancer.  Gus had cancer and lost a leg to it.  The two connect at first through Issac, in the support group and Gus's friend.  Issac is going blind from his cancer.  Gus and Hazel have an immediate connection and they fall in love, despite Hazel trying to fight that from happening.  But young love is never easy, let alone when cancer is involved.This book was a great read.  Readers will come to love these characters and yearn for their happiness.  Green is an incredible author and his writing makes this not just another cancer book.  His writing immediately embraces readers into the lives of these characters and the plot surrounds all.[...]"
5,"m crying now more than ever in book terms. This book made me smile, made me cry, and made me squirm when it got to the kissing parts. Really, those are my high standard criteria, having one, the other, both or all three, which this one has. Right after I read it, finishing at 2:30 in the morning because I couldn't put it down, I decided I must read it again. I love John Green's persuasive select in the words and phrases he used, in that the book became an aspect of my life. It was the moment when he drew something out to deliberately emphasize, yet then he would get straight to the point. I mean, if you want a romantic heartbreaker, put down that crappy Twighlight series and pick up this one. If tears were black, I'd look like a zebra, I cried so hard. I stay melancholy for a reason unknown and vague to those who haven't read this book. You won't regret it, though if you are even close to humane, you will cry at the end, as I did."
5," When I started this book, I thought I knew how it was going to end but now I feel like Hazel did when she wanted to know what happened to Anna in Peter van Housen's book. It's an excellent and emotional story but to be honest, I really am at a loss when it comes to reviewing this book. Do the characters seem real? I don't know....I personally don't know any teen cancer survivors to compare them to. I understood what the parents of these kids went through from a caregiver perspective, having been like Hazel's mom (always waiting on the other side of the door and within earshot) when it came to my own mother and her battle with cancer. Hazel and Augustus were deep thinkers for their age but Hazel herself explained that their maturity was due to the fact that they have had to face their own mortality at such a young age. The love story was beautiful but cut short by tragedy. I can't say more without giving spoilers so I'll stop here."
5," The title of this book does not provide a spoiler.  Anyone deciding to read a book about kids and cancer should expect it to be sad.  But in addition to being sad, it is a great romance and a beautifully told story that will make you laugh and cry.The book is listed as a teen book which left me hesitant to purchase at first, but I decided to give it a try after reading the positive reviews.  Let me assure you it is not just for teens. The main characters are teens but it definitely holds interest for all ages.  As a parent, I related to Hazel and Augustus's parents.The book received some negativve reviews stating that characters were not realistic and depicted as being too mature for teenagers.  I disagree.  They are depicted as childrent forced to grow up quicly in the face of tragedy.I highly recommend this book.  I won't go in to depth with a description as that is the publisher's job."
4," already had seen a synopsis of this book and decided against reading it, when my granddaughter, age 14, and her mother, my daughter, age 44, both recommended it. I am grateful that they did and that I took their suggestion. I found the writing to be excellent and the story, one of star-crossed young love (certainly nothing new there), to be strong and unique.  The forces against Hazel and Gus, the teenage central characters, are the frailties of their own bodies. By the same token there are lessons in this book about facing, fighting and accepting illness and death. I believe that those who suffer terminal illness and constant, insurmountable pain may find value here. Those who love and care for people whose lives are so compromised, hopefully will find better understanding. Do not be misled - This is not a self-help book.  It is at least a well told story and at best, a philosophical exploration of life, death and spirit."
5," There are many words to describe this children's story, and having read it at the young age of twenty four, the only way that I can describe it is that I loved it.I absolutely loved how watching Hazel fall in love with Augustus.  I loved watching how she transitioned from pre-cancer friends to post-cancer friends and how this new group of rag-tag survivors shaped her life throughout the book.  This story of young love overcoming adversity sets a new standard for the Coming of Age genre as a whole.  As you can expect from most Coming of Age stories, the Hazel with whom we're introduced is not the Hazel that we're left with; but what readers aren't expecting is that they aren't the same at the end of the story either.It's cliche as hell, I know; but this book is one of the best short novels that I've read in a long while, and arguably the singular best Young Adult novel that I've read to date."
5," {my thoughts} – This book was amazing. It was nothing short of amazing. Hazel is a teen girl that’s life is highly dependent on experimental drugs and an oxygen tank. Her mother and father worry she is too use to being home and is too depressed so they send her off to a support group for other teenagers in her situation. She attends this support group and meets Gus. Gus is the secondary character in this book and the two off them make for a beautiful story. I laughed, I teared up and I nearly cried. I don’t think anyone could honestly read this book and not like it!The only thing I am not pleased about is that it doesn’t give any answers as to what becomes of Hazel at the end of the book. It sort of stops leaving you wonder the rest. Other then that I could read it over and over again and still enjoy it just as much as the first time I had read it! It was just that wonderful to me. I highly recommend this book."
5," Dear John,  Thank you so much for writing this amazing and heartrending book. It's one of those books where you just stop and look at your life, and you see how it compares to your life. I now realize the even deeper contents of cancer because of you. I will probably read this book over and over again, just as Hazel read An Imperial Affliction over again.  But I was thinking... it would be awesome to know what does like for Augustus. What Gus thought of when he first saw Hazel, what Gus felt when he was suffering, everything. I'm sure this has crossed your mind already, but it would be amazing to have this book in Augustus' point of view. I completely understand if you don't, because it's probably for some greater good life lesson or something, just as van houten didn't write a sequel to An Imperial Affliction. Again, that was such a wonderful book and you've touched many people's lives with it, including mine."
5," ... in absolutely the best way. I read this book in under half a day because I literally couldn't put it down. I bought it around sunset and read in the car until I really couldn't make out the words in front of me anymore. I picked at my dinner, absently pet my cat, I basically sat on the floor and ignored everything around me and stayed up in the wee hours of the morning to finish.And I cried for exactly 99 pages, and it was horrible and made me feel all kinds of things, but I loved every word. John Green is at the top of my favourite authors list, and this book is what propelled him up there. Hazel and Augustus are amazing characters that I loved throughout the entire story. And I know I'll read this book a hundred more times, I've already read it twice.I recommend this book to anyone and everyone, and if my mom weren't so stubborn, I would have thrust this on her months ago and made her love it too."
5," This book had been on my radar for the better part of a year, due to the stellar reviews virtually everywhere.  I finally decided to read it when the Best of 2012 lists came out and there it was again.Kids with cancer - oh, joy was my first thought.  Hazel, Augustus and Isaac are great kids, wise beyond their years, with enough snark and sarcasm to make them real.  Using the fictitious book-within-a-book, An Imperial Affliction, to bring a philosophical bent without having the kids seem preachy or pompous was very effective.A friend who thanked me for the recommendation called it a wonderful, quirky, contemplative book.  Well-said.As a YA novel, it's a quick read, but a very, very slow ponder - this book really resonates.Paraphrasing one of the characters (no spoilers) - in trying to make a mark and be remembered, we risk leaving scars.  This scar was worth it."
2," My friend recommended this book to me and at first I had my doubts. But when I started really reading it I was stuck to it and all I did on a Saturday was read it. I even finished the 300 page book in one day. It was a great story about Augustus and Hazel trying to find their way in a world of cancer.SPOILERS!!!!!!!!When they (Hazel and Augustus) first met at the center and all he could do was stare at Hazel, I had goosebumps. Hazel's life had been horrible and devastating before she met this guy. But when she did and I found out that he actually liked her as much as she liked him my heart was on fire. I love these books when you meet a guy or girl and think they are really hot, only to find out that they would NEVER and I mean NEVER like you the way you like them. But in this book I was happy that Hazel and Augustus found each other because we all know, they needed some light from the darkness."
5," CURSE YOU JOHN GREEN! How dare you pull a Van Houten on me like this! This book changed my life. I will never forget it. I will now desperately search the internet for a sequel, draw Ven Diagrams, and eat eggs for lunch.The Fault in Our Stars is worth every penny, second, and tear. The ending was heartbreaking, but still a good one. If you are debating on buying it, SHUT UP AND READ THE AWESOME BOOK ALREADY!Edit after a second read: OH. MY. GLOB!!!!! There's movie coming out sometime! But this book was still amazing. Every time I read it, I still feel it. This is one of those books where reading it really makes you rethink EVERY. SINGLE. THING. YOU. KNOW. Just shut up and buy the darn book.Edit after a third read: I started this book at 9:00pm, and now it is 12:30pm. I am in tears, because I failed to remember how brutally heart wrenching and beautifully composed this book is."
5," As far as I'm concerned, this book is unprecedented. I haven't read anything like it in quite a while. I'm sixteen years old, and though some people say the author wrote the main characters, especially Hazel and Augustus, not true to what teenagers are like, I think that that wasn't the point. He wrote them the way we wish we could all be when faced with a terminal illness; he made them brave and witty. Living with something like that forces you to grow up in a way few will probably ever understand, in a way I will probably never understand.This book brought to the forefront of my mind every thought and fear I had ever pondered about, and what it would be like to be in such a situation. It's so easy to get sucked into their world, and it reflects what I know I've felt from being on the outside looking in. The illness-repulsion, the pity in everyone's eyes. It's a beautiful work of art, and a must-read."
5," don't think there is high enough praise available for this book.It's a love story, with cancer, and it will break your heart but you can't turn away.I normally don't like emotionally manipulative books, which this one does do, but it subverts the expectations.I have heard books described as a 'Punch in the Gut' before, and I thought that was hyperbole.  I was wrong.I finished this book after one am on a Wednesday night, and I immediately wanted to shout it's praised from the rooftop.  I wanted to call all my friends from high school, and tell them I loved them, and that even though we don't talk as much as we should I still cared.  (We lost one of our group to cancer when we were about the character's age in the book.)I didn't, since I am a grown up and I had work in the morning.Buy this book.  Read it.  Just don't read it in public."
5,"t was Just ok. A good read. I felt the characters were not fully developed. It was like something was missing I felt that Hazel and Gus were too one dimensional, and agree with others that say there were moments where the book was screaming ok time to cry !! When it really didn't pull the emotion from me the way it should. I'm not insensitive to those who are fighting juvenile cancer,as I am a pediatric RN. I just feel that this love story was too contrived and really needed more character development. The parents I felt were very quiet  in this book. I did feel compassin for the children but Seeing the amazing reviews I'm just confused how it was rated so high. Good read and a nice book for young adults but for the 40 something mom pick something else. I was hoping  the ending would be different. Just felt flat of emotion. I'm sorry but this is only my opinion."
5," had never torn through a book in two days before, but this had me succeed into a new categories of reading speed.Like Hazel, I would love to see a sequel to a newly discovered all-time favorite. All though a total chick-flick put onto paper, you have to understand I have never cried at any of the books I have read before. This book was different though. It was touching, but not too full on puppy dying type of book you dread reading after you totally who is going to die and how they will die. If ever not sure why you should keep living on this earth, read this book. If ever not sure why you are lucky to be in health, read this book. If you are ever sick and need someone to relate to, read this book.To sum it up, although slightly predictable, it is certainly a more sophisticated read that will truly leave thinking. (I recommend turning on dictionary when you read this book. VERY USEFUL!)"
2," What a treat! I enjoyed reading The Fault in our Stars for so many different reasons. The writing is brilliant. The dialogue is real and witty and poignant all at the same time. The story is not incredibly original in that there's a whole genre of YA books dedicated to the terminally-ill-star-cross lovers. What makes this story different and worthwhile are the voices of the characters, the imperfection of their personalities and the sheer acceptance of the notion that dying young sucks. John Green writes a story from the perspective of a terminally ill girl and succeeds at capturing her spirit. I found myself not caring as much about the plot of the story as about the people in it. I wanted to spend time with each of his characters and get to know them. I will read this book again, if anything, to spend a little more time savoring the language, understanding the details and visiting with old friends."
5," have always been a fan of John's work, I always have enjoyed watching him and his brother Hank create content on their YouTube channel. When I started to read Green's books, I was struck by the amount of emotional depth and meaning they held. Being a teenager myself, I felt that John Green really understood me (as cliche as that sounds). As I made my way through The Fault in Our Stars, I was blown away. Green's language, dark humor, and raw honesty created in me a love for this book which shall never cease. This book made me laugh, cry and everything in between. I have never before felt so attached to a book. Finishing the book wasn't easy, simply because I did not want to leave the universe that I had entered. I wanted to stay with the characters because they felt so life like. My outlook on life has been altered, and my perspective has been broadened. The Fault in Our Stars truly changed my life."
5," Hazel is a 16 year old who was diagnosed with Cancer at a very young age. Since then her life has exsist of hospitals,  doctor appointments, testing and oxygen machines. Seeing Hazel slipping into depression, her mother urges her to attend a support group for kids with Cancer. This is where she meets the amazing Augustus Waters. An event that wakes her up and changes everything.This is the second time reading TFIOS, and its just as heartbreaking as the first time I read it. The story of Hazel &amp; Augustus is beautiful, real and absolutely gut wrenching.  Once you start, you won't want to put it down. It will make you laugh and cry and then cry some more. John Green is a master storyteller and The Fault In Our Stars, so far is his best.  I'm always amazed how well he captures what its like and what it is to be a young adult. His characters are always real and true. A must read for all ages."
5," Having been an oncology nurse in the past, I loved, liked, and hated this book.  It has been many years since I have thought about the patients I was privileged enough to be present while they passed on to their next life. I saw young and old and they helped me to realize how precious life is.Everyone wants to leave their mark in the world but for Hazel, she knows that being young and terminally ill, she will soon be forgotten when she dies. Then she meets a handsome young boy that had suffered from cancer and the two embark on an adventure that brings life to their short one.  They realize the impact they make only matters to the ones that truly live life with them and not around them.The book ended exactly how I would imagine.  So no disappointments.  I just don't know how I feel about it.  Still processing. I couldn't put it down and read it in less than a day and a half."
2," *Warning! Spoilers!*This book was the most amazing, touching, devastating book I have ever read in my life. As soon as you meet Augustus Waters, you fall in love with him. I don't know how John Green does this, but as soon as Gus was introduced, he was already my favorite character. Both Gus and Hazel Grace slowly fall into a sweet relationship, but it's very complicated--at first--for Hazel, since she has lung cancer. However, this book takes the most heartbreaking turn of all books. I sobbed from that turning point until the very end and I literally could not stop crying. Although his comic relief is great, really great, it's not enough to cover up the sadness that this whole book demonstrates. And I never cry at books, so it was saying a lot that I literally sobbed. This review, I've realized, is becoming very repetitive, but maybe that's because this book was too good for words."
5," Terminal cancer when you're 16, it sounds awful but somehow with John Green at the helm, it isn't. I loved, no, that isn't enough. I LOVVVVVVVED this book. Green is a master at emotionally connecting the reader with the characters.  The main characters, Hazel Grace &amp; Augustus Waters' wit, dark sense of humor and obvious love for one another makes it hard to put this book down. Fault is a touching love story about two people who meet unexpectedly at a *cancervania* (clever!) self help meeting and quickly find they do not want to live a life without one another, no matter the unavoidable outcome. It's a modern day Romeo and Juliet and I'm intrigued by this author and can't wait to read more from him. He's a fellow Hoosier to boot! Thank you for writing such a beautiful and touching novel. It's been quite some time since I read a book with a great ending and dude, you nailed it. Job well done."
5," The Fault in Our Stars is an incredible story about a girl, her relationships with different people, and the sickness that life has handed to her. However, it’s also about so much more. John Green’s book really touched me on a personal level. The author emphasized living in the moment because you never really know when your last day will be. He doesn’t sugar coat anything, but rather tells it how it is. I believe he wants to get across that its not about how long you live, but it’s what you do during the time you live, and the different lives you touch that ultimately matter. This book is technically written for young adults but I feel like this is one of those books that would definitely be suitable for all ages, especially because of the message it tries to portray. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for something that will possibly give them some perspective on life."
5," To be honest i was a bit worried about this book, I had been disappointed with Green`s first book Looking for Alaska (It was good but I felt every one of my 23 years. It is definitely aimed at a younger audience and it just had too much sex, drinking and swearing for me) However this is definitely of of those books that crosses over ages. I feel like a teenager would enjoy it, the language is complex and as a prospective English teacher I love that it is not watered down. Even I had to think for a min about some of the words meaning. The story makes you think and is of a serious nature (life, death, cancer, love)but it still makes you laugh. I feel like the story has a different dynamic for me because I am a parent and I can identify with the parents as well as the main characters,  I would highly recommend this book to older teens and adults alike, best book i have read in quite a while."
5," really enjoyed The Fault in Our Stars! For Green to be writing a 16 year old girl as well as he did -- I applaud him for that. Obviously Hazel isn't a 'typical' teenager, but still.This book was beautifully written and I felt like I was on an emotional roller coaster along with the characters. I adore the main characters, Hazel and Augustus, and their back-and-forth dialogue and sincere interactions. To tackle things like cancer and loss with as much tactful humor as John Green did... I loved. It was a heartbreaking read about the devastating and terrible effects of cancer, but to 'lighten' the content a bit with incredibly likable characters who did not just BECOME their cancer... it was well done. The cancer consumed their lives in every way, but it did not DEFINE them.Bottom line: I laughed, I cried... I loved it. I'd highly recommend this book. Just read it."
5," This book. Where should I start? I heard really good things about this book, but I was still apprehensive about reading it because I'm more of an action/ fiction kinda girl. I'm never really in to realistic fiction. But this book blew me away. This book gave me a whole new perspective on life and its value. I finished this book the same day a mass school shooting happened just ten miles from me. Little children had their lives ripped from their hands and the whole country felt the grief. It was the second worst school shooting in history. All of this made me think about how easily that could have been me or my brother or my best friend. Then, when I finished this book,  I realized that human life is a fragile thing. You need To value it. This book really changed my life. I would recommend it to anyone, even if they hated these types of books. {Oh, and BTW, I cried really hard at the end}"
5,"n a short, awesome book (206 pages in my Kindle), John Green has made a forever kind of impact.Books and movies about the brevity of life and the meaning of death are usually emotional and place emphasis on love and relationships.  Well, this book is no different.  Death and its inevitability has a way of flushing out the temporal pleasures of wealth and achievement.  But the way the author weaved the story, built his characters, and the way he infused literary quotes amidst an international backdrop (well, Amsterdam at least) and violent stress-busting video games, makes this book a real gem.  The book heavily referenced within TFIOS, An Imperial Affliction, is a fictional book, but I have no doubt it would also be an excellent read, if John Green ever decides to pen it in its entirety.Anyone, of any age or background, will enjoy this read.  Highly recommended."
5," John Green’s novel The Fault In Our Stars is one of the great love story that comes around only every so often but it also so much more then a teenage love story. John Green writes about the developing relationship of teenage cancer patient Hazel Grace and Augustus “Gus” Waters, an in remission cancer patient. Hazel and Augustus’s relationship as tragic and romantic as it is means so much more. It develops in such a realistic way that you can’t help but feel as if you know the characters. This John Green novel causes the reader to feel so many emotions that you begin to hate him for writing such a spectacular piece of literature. The Fault In Our Stars is a must read for anyone who is a hopeless romantic and is ready to let the tears start to falling from their eyes. The book has also become a motion picture and is coming out in theaters very soon so read it before seeing the movie!!!"
5," By turns moving and hilarious, John Green's novel is an instant classic. His prose is economical and descriptions are never terribly detailed but simultaneously it allows for stunning growth of the characters and an engrossing involvement of the reader. The story moves at a excellent pace that doesn't leave you breathless but instead leads you on comfortably.The characters can be a bit hipster at times for my taste but beyond all of the phrases like my lungs suck at being lungs, meant to make it painfully clear just how quirky and awesomely hip the characters are, lie very likeable and relateable characters that feel like your close friends by the end of the book. Indeed the characters become fully realized people with whom you empathize and about whom you truly care.I cannot recommend this book enough. And at the Amazon price you can't beat the deal!"
5, a roller coaster of emotion.  what a ride.  feeling raw and exposed.  this hurt very much.  wouldn't have missed the ride for the world!
2," was really cautious about all the great reviews before reading this book. I did not want to be let down as so often happens with things that get such great hype. However, I was not let down, and this is a book I will cherish for years to come, if not for decades. I don't want to write anything specific for fear of spoiling, but it is heartbreaking and beautiful and life-affirming. Sometimes you read books and you can tell that the author didn't really give it their all, but it is very evident to me that John gave everything he had telling this story. Nothing about the story telling is lazy or disappointing. Not a single word feels wrong or out of place. As an adult, I want to encourage other adults to read this. It may be categorized as 'young adult', but great authors transcend labels and categories, and this book is much better written than most of the adult fiction I have read."
5, This was an easy read. It made me laugh. It made me cry. The story was so real. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good read.
5,"ve gotta say, I've wanted to read this book for a LONG time. The price is the only thing that's held me back for so long. I finally stopped being cheap and bought it and let me say...It is worth EVERY last cent. Warning: You will cry. No matter how much you say you won't, you will. I tried so hard not to. Its just a heartbreaking story of life and love. John Green does an extremenly wonderful job of making you feel connected to the characters which makes this book so difficult to read. You'll love them, hate them, be annoyed by them, and feel for them. Its a sad story but Green somehow manages to make you laugh out loud at the perfect moments. You've been warned. This is a beautiful story and I reccomend it to anyone and everyone. Before you read it, you may want to get a new box of tissues and keep em close. You're gonna need them. Enjoy it, you won't be able to put it down!"
5," First of all, let me start this by saying, I believe there are books written to entertain and there are books written to touch your soul. THE FAULT IN OUR STARS is a book that touches your soul. I'm kind of struggling with writing this review, because nothing I say is going to justify how absolutely amazing this book was. John Green's ability to have me laughing and sobbing in the same breath has blown me away. The subject matter of this book is bleak, but he still manages to infuse humor in the places you would least expect. This was, by far, the most beautifully written book I have ever read. As for the characters, Hazel and Augustus were my two favorite characters in a book. Ever. Witty and brave, when these two got together on a page, you couldn't help but smile. This is one that will break your heart, but it's worth every tear shed. THE FAULT IN OUR STARS is a must read!"
5," This has easily become my favorite book of all time. Amazingly well written, poignant, and humorous, it's a thoughtful book that will appeal to both Young Adults and Adults, which is a rarity.The characters and writing make this book stand out from the rest. John Green is clearly a master writer, who knows how to twist words and sentences into beautiful prose. The main protagonists, Hazel Grace and Gus Waters are characters that you will never forget. He depicted them so beautifully, that you feel like you know them and ache for them by the end of the book. And also, you will find yourself quoting all the memorable lines from the book, such as My thoughts are like the stars, which I cannot fathom into constellations.This book is required reading for EVERYONE who enjoys a good story. It reminds you of why you love reading in the first place."
5," At first when I read the summary I thought it would be one of those stupid cliché books about two teenagers who fall in love. If any of you readers out there are thinking about reading this book, but are having the same thoughts as I did...STOP THINKING. This book is so far fetched from a cliché teen romance. I have read every and I mean EVERY popular teen book out today (being a teenager and all) and no other book has moved me like this. Not even the end of the Hunger Games trilogy. I have never felt so strongly for any single book. I cried so hard for so long with this book that I had to put it down because I couldn't keep reading through the sting of my tears. Not only did I cry, but I LAUGHED and not just a chuckle. Books have never EVER made me cry so trust me when I say The Fault in Our Stars has taken me on an emotional rollercoaster that I will never stop riding."
5," couldn't get attached to the characters, I loved the point of view it was written from, but just wish someone else wrote it. Great idea, sweet characters, just didn't get attached to it. John Green isn't my favorite writer and his books are all hyped up to be great but they just fall flat."
5," really loved this book, except for one (kind of big for me) thing. First, I loved the prose and I loved the characters. I liked the way Gus called Hazel Hazel Grace, and I liked how mature they were. I think pain and disease would do that. Having watched my mom die of cancer, I liked how honest this book was. It wasn't afraid to talk about vomit, pee, falling down, and the stupid things people say. I really loved Peter Van-what's-his-name, who showed us that cancer hurts and destroys more than just its victims. But here's the big thing that bothered me. I just don't think 16 year olds, even those with cancer, are mature enough for sex. And when they went to Amsterdam, they hadn't even kissed yet. I guess Gus just carried around some condoms because he was optimistic? This could have been a perfect book. But throwing the sex in was just messy (and irresponsible.)"
1," had heard of this book months ago, but wasn't sure I would care for it. It sounded depressing &amp; thought it might be exploiting cancer to sell books. It was actually well done though. It is a YA novel and reads like one. Not in a bad way, but just highlights some of the immaturity of the characters. They react as teenagers, not as adults, which is refreshing. It was very insightful in terms of giving you a better understanding of those living with cancer or other terminal diseases. It didn't do it in a preachy way, but pointed out how we deal with people with cancer individually and as a society. And how it feels from the other side. The story was more about Hazel &amp; Augustus and their connection, friendship and love. There were a couple of parts that seemed far fetched, but it is a story and it was related to the plot. I enjoyed the book and would recommend it."
5," was in the hospital a great deal as a kid (not cancer but it could kill you).I found the hospital parts of this book amazing for  a work of fiction, they captured the desperation without sounding so sad. I also loved the way he presented characters that were not the perfect trooper who takes it all with a smile. The smiling child with a serious disease is fiction created to make others feel better. The love story was perfect in a Romeo and Juliet kind of way but, it is not parents they are fighting it is cancer. The existential war within these lovers is amazing to read and central to the story. I know I had a very hard period 12-17, didn't we all, but when you think your life is going to be short it is acute. I loved this book for bringing to life the pain that kids should be able to suffer without the pressure to be a perfect spokes people for the disease."
2," John Green is going to be remembered as one of the greatest authors of our time. Mark my words.Yes, this is technically a young adult book. Fortunately, John Green writes for young adults as they are, which is that they are capable of understanding and processing complicated emotions and situations, and dealing with them appropriately. They're teenagers, and thus use adult language and break rules, but are also not prone to temper tantrums (mostly) and flawed young people.AFTER you read this book (not before), go read what John Green has to say about the novel and how he writes for young adults. His frankness and his respect for young people is something most people need to take note of.That said, the story is well rounded, interesting, and heartbreakingly wonderful. Read with tissues. You'll need them between laughing fits."
5," The dialogue is very unnatural and unrealistic.  I found myself thinking over and over again that kids that age just don't use those words or phrases or have discourse of that character.  So in my opinion, the author comes off a bit pedantic and the characters do not seem real, but rather just extensions of the authors intellect and ego."
5," this book is so amazing!! I honestly do like the book better than the movie mainly because it has more detail than the movie. I honestly thought that Hazel would have died first, as her case was a bit more serious than Augustus', but when he told her about the PET scan, I really did cry. There were several parts in the book where I cried like I have never before. Realizing that Hazel and Augustus had a short time together, but from Hazel's point of view, made a short time sound like forever. I read a quote after the book and it made me realize where the title came from. I will quote it, And in the end, we can blame the stars or tell ourselves that it wasn't meant to be, that it wasn't destined to happen but deep down we know that the stars were not at fault and it wasn't meant to be. The fault was in ourselves. Over all I highly recommend this book."
2," all i can say is that this book is absolutely perfect. i am not even much of a reader, but i finished this book in 2 days (and thats incredibly fast for me). i fell in love with augustus waters. head over heals in love. he was absolutely perfect. since the moment i opened the book, i couldn't put it down. i went over to my grandparents house the next day, and all i could think about at my grandparents house is what happens next. all i wanted to to is read more. i cried, some parts were happy tears and many were sad tears. but it was a good sad, its hard to explain. now that the book is over, I'm happy and sad. I'm happy because its the best book i have ever read in my whole life. but I'm sad because i really want to read it again, but if i read it again, it won't be the same. i won't get to experience it the same way. so all i can say is read this book."
5," Up front, let me say that I am a huge, biased, crazy nerdfighter, or a fan of John and his brother Hank and all that they do on the internet. Now you know and can be an informed reader of this review.The Fault in Our Stars vividly and unapologetically does away with the Cancer Kid stereotype, and does it with a realism that can only come from someone who has an intimate knowledge of cancer and what it does to a person.John makes you care about the characters as if they were your best friends, and then takes them to the highest and lowest of possible places, bringing your emotions along. I cried for about four hours while reading this book, and when I wasn't crying, I was laughing so hard that I was crying. However, it never seemed as though the humor was only there for comic relief. It was always just what anyone would say or do in such a moment."
5," really don't know if there are words to describe how I feel about this book.This book...  This book...Left me breathless.I really had to ponder if I was reading about fictional characters or if I had really somehow ended up inside the head of a cancer infected teenage girl, in love with a cancer infected teenage boy.  I really don't know if I've ever read a book that had better voice to it.  It was honest, brutal, and real.I really don't think there is any more I can say about it.  I will not be surprised if this is my favorite book of 2012, an we're only in February.  I wasn't planning on picking up this book, I'm VERY picky about what contemporary YA I read, but when I saw what good reviews it's gotten I couldn't help it.  This is one of those books that really does live up to its hype.GO.  READ.  THIS.  BOOK.  NOW!5 out of 5 stars!"
5," was literally speechless when I finished this book. I thought for a while about what I might say in a review, because I was so incredibly moved by this story.If you are considering reading this book, don't be afraid of it. I was. I thought for a few days before I downloaded. I was leery of reading a book about kids with terminal cancer. I'm so glad I didn't let my fear keep me from reading this book.  You see, this book is not so much about dying as it is about LIVING. So many passages moved me... Gus referring to cancer as a civil war with predetermined winner... Hazel saying she'd trade all the sick days she had left for a few healthy ones... and so many others made me really stop and think about how a cancer patient truly looks at life.This book broke my heart, but in a beautiful way.  I'm so so glad I read it.5 VERY ENTHUSIASTIC stars."
5," The Fault in our Stars..... What can I say about this FANTASTIC book? One of the best of 2012 I can tell you that! This is John Green's 4th solo book and I have read 3/4 of his books. All I can say about Mr. Green is that he is surely one of the best authors of our generation. This book is about a 16 year old girl who is a survivor of Type 4 Thyroid cancer and it has spread to her lungs. Hazel , just wants everyone to accept that we are ALL gonna die. Until she meets Augustus Waters that is , a sexy , funny 17 year old , who himself osteosarcoma( common to bone cancer). They experience some crazy stuff together. The stuff teenagers experience , but so much more pure and pulling at your heart. If you want a fantastic read that gives you all the emotions, PLEASE I beg of you pick up John Green's The Fault in our Stars. You will surely not regret it."
5," have read many books before and after this book and none have yet topped this coming of age romance by John Green. The main character, Hazel, is a more realistic cancer patient who doesn't sugar coat the complications of her stage 4 thyroid cancer. Then, Augustus Waters comes along and he is an in remission cancer patient who is sweet, charming, hilarious, and heartfelt. Their love story is a different twist on your typical YA romance novel, which sticks out in the genre. This story made me look at life in a different way after I read it. It taught me to cherish what I have because anything and everything can change in an instant. This book will always be one of the best. If you are ever considering reading this book, READ IT! This book is a masterpiece of modern literature and everyone should experience this astounding novel of love and loss."
5,"t's sad to say, but this book is completely overrated. :c After reading some reviews I expected to learn something meaningful, and have my heart smashed to tiny lil pieces...yeah that didn't happen &gt;_&lt; John Green tried WAY to hard to make this a deep book, that it's ridiculous. I laughed at how unrealistic Hazel and Augustus are, they're not even human they're more like robots programmed to say the cheesiest things ever cx and spoiler but once Augustus was introduced in the book, it's pretty clear he was gunna die -.- ( which brings me to another point for an author who tries to make everything philosophical and meaningful, Augustus' death was so rushed, I don't understand how anyone could cry) Anywho I'm in the minority here, since it seems like most people here LOVE this book, so if you read it you most likely will like it, I guess."
2," The Fault in Our Stars is truly a brilliant novel. As a teen, I have read many other books consisting vampires, werewolves, angles, and other fictional ideas. I was starting to get annoyed and frustrated at the fact that almost every teen book you pick up has some sort of magical story hidden within.In the 5 hour journey of reading the Fault in Our Stars, I was laughing hysterically, incredibly confused, and, most of all, crying my heart out. John Green has a way of ripping your heart out and placing it back in the wrong way. I fell in love with all the characters immediately.Despite your age, go on this incredible journey with Hazel, Augustus, Isaac, and experience something that will possibly change your life.I don't really know what else to say. My thoughts are stars I can't fathom into constellations. ;)"
2, From what I had read about this book I expected my world to turn upside down after reading it. It was okay but not life-altering.
5," This is a very well written book, that makes you appreciate the small things in life, because we all know that nothing lasts forever. John's books are truly inspiring. From the two of his books that I have read, there have been deaths. And the other character never gave up, no matter how much they wanted to. And I feel like everyone has grown up wanting to leave a mark on the world, I don't remember when, but I stopped, and I never knew why. Now I realize the truth in what John Green has said, and I don't want to leave any scars. Yes I realize that death is inevitable, and that so is the leaving of scars. So I guess the only thing to do is to make it worth it. It's easier to bear the pain if you believe that it was worth it. And when people read my comment they will find many flaws in what I believe, but our faults make us unique.-ks"
3," This book is easily the best book I have read in a long time. The first time I read it as a borrowed copy from a friend, and then I had to go out and buy my own. Everyone I know who has read it cried while reading it. That's one of the reasons I like this book so much. It causes you to feel very strobgly about the characters, and it does have real world connectiong to it. I also really like that the part you cry it can be your own. There isn't a specific part of this book that you're supposed to cry at. You cry when you cry and you laugh when you laugh, so when you read this book you can make it your own. It's also a thinking book, once you put it down or finish it, it causes you to think afterwards. I love this book so much (present tense)!! If you are considering this book I highly reccomend you go for it! You will not be dissapointed!!"
5," always approach a new book with a sense of trepidation, particularly when the author is one that I am fond of. There's always the fear that this new book won't live up to my expectations, and then what? And, for the first chapter or so, this concern was not completely washed away. Sure, it was good, but was it ~really~ going to be better than Looking for Alaska, the way it had been hyped up to be? It didn't seem so, at first.Still, it wasn't long before the writing settled into place and the characters began to take on sympathetic lives. I think John Green did what he set out to do--create a book about cancer, but not about cancer; write a story where the characters were not glorified as noble sufferers, but as people who are just as scared and lonely as anyone would be in their place. True to fashion, he wove humor amongst even the darker hours; he presented metaphors that were perhaps not in the grand literary fashion, but were honest to the human condition; he reminded readers that perhaps our heroes are not all we have idealized them to be.I admit. I cried. I cried hard, but not for the characters in the book---I cried because the story found within it spoke to the reality of life; the reality that this could happen even to the person I care about most. I would confidently recommend this book to anyone, young or old, as a read that will engage both mind and emotion on a journey that leaves you not with a sense of loss, but rather a feeling of personal gain for having read it."
5," don't want to give away anything but basically the fault in our stars is about two teens in love, but they know their time is short because of cancer. I started reading this book Yesterday evening, and being the kind of 13 year old book worm I am, I didn't stop reading until I finished....at 1:30 in the morning. And I don't usually cry over fiction but this book made me sob into my pillow for the last like 7 chapters or so ( and i had to be very quite because my parents were asleep and I didn't want to wake them). This is gonna sound cheesy but after I finished, I kind of started thinking of the world differently. It really opened me up to the struggle cancer victims go through. This was one of the best books I have ever read and if you are debating on whether or not you should read TFIOS i strongly suggest you do. You won't regret it!"
5," have cried in several books including Nicholas Sparks.  I had a feeling tears would come with the characters of this book having cancer.  This was a beautiful touching romantic lovely humorous story.  I felt a bit dumb at some of the words and conversations in this book, but maybe the words were made up more than actual.  I loved how well written Hazel, Augustus, and Isaac all are throughout this story.  I was drawn into this story so easily and couldn't let go till the very last page.  The ending was beautiful.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this book, I am not sure I can make it thru the movie, there is something about reading this kind of story then knowing the movie is going to replay it all.  And I am happy my daughter wants to read this book.  She isn't too into reading but I will encourage her to read more like her mom.  Thank you John Green."
5," Wow, I am almost speechless. I really don't want to do a review since I don't think I can do it justice. I'll give it a shot though. I got this book as a gift. A friend of mine said it was a great read, and he couldn't put it down. So he bought me a copy and told me to read it. I did! and Wow!! My breath was taken away, I cried, I laughed out loud, I cried, I wanted to throw the book (if it wasn't a Kindle copy) across the room, I yelled at the characters for being stupid!! I felt like I was a ghost along for a ride with the characters. I was on a whirlwind with this book. I think it was due to the fact the subject matter hit close to home and I honestly felt for the characters. From the very beginning, I was entranced with this book. It drew me in and wouldn't let me go til I was done. So thank you my friend for giving me this gift!!"
5," The Fault in Our Stars allows you to revisit that young adult mind, with its insightful portrayal of the main characters. I started reading this book and was enthralled and reading into the wee hours of the morning. I have never felt so heartbroken for characters before and I am okay  to admit that I was unable to stop the tears and sobbing and felt so compelled to finish the story as I felt I needed, no I owed it to the characters to finish this story for them. Its about a love and a friendship so pure and true you can't help but continue to think about them after the story has  finished. John Green has written a beautiful tragic story that shows life in all its reality. I would gladly, singing from the roof tops praise and recommend this book! Even now starting my work day, my mind is still wrapped around these character's stories!"
5," was rather skeptical of reading this book when I arrived at a bookstore to take a look at it. The customer service worker told me I could find it in the Teen Section of the store. That put me off and I left without buying it. I eventually kept hearing great things about this book and decided to purchase it.This book was GREAT! Easy read and tear-jerker. (DAMN YOU JOHN GREEN!)Luckily, I read most of this book in the comfort of my own home, so I didn't have any embarrassing moments being that random person crying in the park reading teenage-some book.Overall, this book is written in a relatable way, suspending your willingness of disbelief.The characters can easily be someone you can imagine being friends with...I highly recommend buying this book.No seriously, buy it."
2," have never written a review before in here, but I chose to do one for this book. This book is more than a book. I am the kind of reader who finds a deeper meaning and comprehends every sentence. It is more than a love story and it is more than a cancer story. It doesn't have a happy ending where Hazel beats cancer and her and Augustus live happily ever after. And for that reason it makes this book all the better. John Green did a wonderous job of showing us that life isn't always going to have a happy ending, but rather have happy things happen throughout our life. It also shows us that no matter what we go through, we will have people to help us get through and we just have to keep fighting. Life is just one big fight to get through. Like I said, this wasn't a love story and this wasn't a cancer story. It's a lot more than that"
5," This is one of those books that should be on everybody's 100-books-to-read-before-you-dielist's. It's so beautifully depressing (I don't know how else to put it). It makes you reflect on who you are, and it makes you think about who you want to be.Teenager's will be able to relate to it, and adults will no doubt love it, as well.However, if you don't enjoy things that will make you sad, then don't read it. A little spoiler alert: it will make you sad. Very, very, sad. Aka, it will make you cry so much that you won't be able to read, and you need 10 minutes to calm yourself down before you can continue. And then you read more, and then you cry more... it's one of those never ending cycles.However, despite the fact that it is so sad, you should read it.Beautifully depressing, indeed."
5," This is one of the best books I've read in some time.  John Green's channeling of a very bright 16-year-old girl is believable and engaging, and his humor highly entertaining.  The story tugs at my heartstrings, of course, and prompts me to think about death and dying from the perspective of kids with terminal cancer who mostly do not live past their teens. More than that, the book focuses on the meaning of life, what we leave behind, whether or not we make a mark in the world, and does it matter?  We are drawn into the everyday pain and challenges these terminal kids face, as well as their parents who must deal with the reality of losing their children and find ways to cope.  The story is brave and honest and real and so well-written that I can't help but love the characters and experience their joys and sorrows along with them."
5," There isn't much I can say about this book that hasn't already been said...I haven't cried so hard from a book since I read 'My Sisters Keeper' . 'The Fault in Our Stars' is heartbreaking, thought provoking, smart, and just so DARN GOOD it takes your breath away. Everything you feel in a great book you will feel here.I feel raw and BLEEDING after reading it...I look around at other people and wonder how the heck they can't feel what I AM feeling from this story. Augustus and Hazel will stay with me...and when I think of them my chest will tighten a bit. But like Augustus said that the thing about about pain, it demands to be felt. I wouldn't have it any other way, I CHOOSE to let this book break me a little bit, so I can be filled back up with raw passion of it.Read it, and you will know what I mean..."
5," This was a really good story and written very well. I really liked it but I didn't love it! There was a lot of hype with this one and I don't feel that it lived up to it.Hazel Grace Lancaster is dying of cancer and goes to her weekly Cancer Kid Support Group where she meets Augustus (Gus) Waters and they develop a kindred friendship right away.Hazel Grace had already written her life story, but everything changes when Gus comes into her life. She is now more active and taking advantage to what life she has left as a teen. This is her story and how her views differ from the norm.This book deals with life and death and the life of cancer. It was well written and I think John Green is a fantastic author. Even though I didn't love this story, I would be willing to read another one of his books."
5," just got out of the hospital, and just got off all the antibiotics, drugs, and vast quantities of potassium. So of course now that my mind wasn't being completely addled and ridiculous I decide to start reading again. This book is everywhere, but it's a good book so it's deserved. To me it came across as slightly pretentious and a little over-rated mostly because quotes and snippets of the best parts in the book are pasted every w here for people to read out of context and not fully appreciate. At the saga and time this book was heartbreaking and hilarious. Maybe I am slightly biased because of how much it  resonated with me (except my distinct lack of cancer), but I feel like this is a book that deserves to be honestly read. This is a book that should be read with very little foreknowledge and a vast amount of immersion."
4, This book is just beautiful and pulls at your heart strings every minute. It makes you look a at life a whole lot differently.
4," absolutely loved The Fault in Our Stars! I had heard a lot about it but hadn't bought it until 3/25/13 and lets just say it was finished before the 26th. The way it's written is great it felt so real like I was part of it. Everyone should read it because it's relatable. I recommended it to one of my friends and now she loves it. Props to John Green for being such a talented writer. One thing I really want to know is; Will there be a sequel? I want to know what happened to Hazel's family and Issac and Augustus's family. This is petty but what happened to Van Houten? I would love to see a sequel come out, I'd buy it in a heartbeat. This book made me laugh and cry and sometimes at the same time! I will never find a book as great as this one! If you are debating reading it, well, ha! there's nothing to debate. Just read it!"
5," can't believe a simple book consisting of 320pages could have me balling my eyes out clutching my duvet instead of packing for what should be the most life changing weekend but couldn't help it. I had to read more. I finally finished. I'm sad I finished actually. I wish it was more of an ending that left you knowing what happens to everyone. This must have been the feeling they always felt about the book they finally finished. It seems ironic that John green would put a writer in the story that did precisely what he did and leave us wondering why and yet I'm not mad or sad, I'm longing to know and I guess that's the great thing about this book, you will forever remember it as the book that made an impact. And yes while John green made a scar it is a scar that I many won't forget but I must say, I don't regret it at all"
5," read this reluctantly and solely because of its 7-week lofty position on the NY Times bestseller list.I am not a fan of 'young adult', but John Boyne's 'The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas' changed my views. Around the time it came out and the ensuing hullabaloo, I resisted reading, but had to when I was asked to give a talk on Writing and 'The Boy...' in a local school. I was blown away by the story and never before or since have I come across such a powerful ending.'The Fault in our Stars' is the story of a doomed love affair between two teenagers who have terminal cancer. It encompasses all the awkward newness of first love, is beautifully written, heartbreaking and elevating at the same time.I believe I am hooked on 'Young Adult' fiction which has the power to cross into mainstream!"
2," This is the first of John Green's books that I've had the pleasure to read at it's release date, but I'm only getting around to reviewing it now, though I read it right away. This was book was amazing, funny, heart-wrenching, and nearly un-putdownable. I loved it. There may have been tears. It was wonderful and moving.I could sit here and continue to gush-goodness knows I've done it enough to my friends. I'll leave you with this: I don't get emotional with books. I love books and become invested, but rarely do they move to me to laugh out loud or shed any tears. I'm not a crier with either books or films. However, this did both. I laughed out loud, and I welled a bit, because I was so invested in the characters. This is a book I'll reread and enjoy just as much the second time around.Read my full review here: [...]"
5, This book was really a good book. I couldn't put it down and I'm not one for reading books but I finished this one in 3 days.
5," got into it from the beginning and could not put it down.  The very adult dialog of the teens threw me off at first but I realized that their circumstances caused them to face adult issues very early.  Hazel and Gus were the main characters and although you knew the eventual outcome, the journey to that outcome kept them and the reader going.  The  character of the european author was more poorly developed and written, but did not detract from the story.  I recommended this to my husband who agreed with this review except to add that the boy who lost his sight was his favorite character.My confusion and disagreement is with Amazon's genre characterization of this book as a Young Adult book.  We are two very adult readers who did not find this a youth oriented book, except for the age of the characters."
5," oh Hazel and Augustus, your love story was epic indeed.  When adults question the credibility and sincerity of a teenager's romantic love, we doubt because of bitterness and perhaps, being burned too many times in the past.  But we have much to learn from their way of falling in love without fear and without holding back.  That is, perhaps, how we should fall in love each and every time...as if it was the very first.  Thank you for reminding us, Hazel and Augustus.I cried in 3 different parts of this book.  I had a hard time closing the book because I didn't want the story to end.  I got so attached to the characters.  yes, even van Houten.This book is definitely in my TOP 5 books of all time - up there with The Kite Runner, Memoirs of a Geisha, 11/22/1963 and The Help.BRAVO, John Green!"
5, Engaging story and well written. Enjoyed it immensely. A real page turner with poignant moments and theme. Bravo John Green.
5, enjoyed this because of real life...it was humorous and heart warmingly painful all at once... Even if you've never experienced anyone close with cancer... We've all experienced loss of hope or love... And yet to come back full circle to thankfulness of what has been experienced and discovered.It's a beautiful reality of a persons thought life... Even though made up (fiction) people think these things... I love the beauty of honest thoughts even when they are negative sometimes.... It's done in a humorous way sort of... It's just good... Thought provokingly good....and perhaps it's where I am at in my own life that I enjoyed it so much.... It's a look at Sunday through Saturday of a persons deteriorating life... It may be boring to some... It's beauty in the small things.... Anyway ...WP
5," think I'm in love--with Augustus Waters, Hazel Grace, and  . . . John Green. Compelling, accessible yet not afraid to take on a subject like teens dying of cancer without sentimentality or cheap ploys for sympathy, The Fault in Our Stars is incredibly funny and many-tissues sad, but it never wallows. As a cancer survivor, it felt refreshingly honest and (I would say dead-on, but that sounds like a pun in really poor taste), but I think it would have been just as meaningful if I didn't unfortunately have first-person knowledge of what he's talking about. He's created such wonderful characters and a story of that first and perhaps only true love (including even the love of that very favorite book when you're a teen). Even though I'm a grown-up I now plan to read all of his books--what a great discovery."
5," don't usually read books like this I usually read book more along the line of the Immortal Instruments. So when I read this book I didn't really expect to enjoy it that much I just needed to read it for my summer reading. I had read a few reviews for the Fault in Our Stars before reading the actual book and I thought oh it's just another live story type thing (like dear John, The Notebook) but it was so much more then a love story. I found myself actually in Hazel's shoes experiencing everything as if I was Hazel herself. By the time the I finished the book I had laughed, felt true love, guilty for having eyes, crying my eyes out, and most of all I felt pure pleasure in saying I found my Imperial Affliction. I promise this book is no let down! I will more than likely read this book over and over again."
5, Once u pick it up u NEVER put it down. It's an amazing book with a plot twist. Good luck not finishing it the first day. (:
5," usually don't write reviews, actually, I've never written a review of a public forum, but...I just finished this AMAZING book literally minutes ago and had to get something down in print. I'm a reader. I love to read and have read many many books, this has to be at the top of my list as one of the most amazing books I've ever read. Books, for me, have the ability to completely change/alter my outlook on life. This book just did that. It was so well written, characters were well developed, I fell in love with them.The summary says grab a box of tissues, and that's no joke. I laughed, I sobbed, I feel like such a mixed bag of emotions I don't even know how to explain it. All I can say is this is a book I will recommend to everyone and anyone and one I will re-read over and over."
2,"f Amazon would let us give half-stars, this would actually be a 4.5. I'm just very picky about those 5-star ratings.Everything about this book was beautiful. Well, except for the kids having cancer, of course, but Mr. Green even managed to turn that into something beautiful by giving these kids such amazing perspectives on life, on love, on loss, on humanity. At the risk of sounding cliché, Hazel and Gus (and Isaac too) are those kind of people who, just by knowing them, make your life more interesting. And even though they are just characters in a book, I'm glad that I got to spend a few hours with them.There was a point in the book, about 3/4 through it, that I cried like a baby and just.could.not.stop. So brace yourself, don't read it in public, and have some tissues ready."
5," cannot express enough words to describe the amazing way this book is written. I had first heard of the book The Fault in Our Stars from my Aussie friend Alice. She showed it to the class, but I was too busy reading another book to listen! I recently heard the movie for The Fault in Our Stars is coming to theaters June sixth, so I decided that it was time to read the book. Being only in sixth grade, most of my friends had read the book and thought it was inappropriate for us. But being the bold one in the group, I didn't really care what John Green had for them. I cared what he had for me. Being a fangirl of many fandoms, I say to my fellow fangirls, there was J.K Rowling, Rick Riordan, Suzanne Collins, etc.,so now we must add the name of John Green to our long list of amazing authors! Huzzah!!!!!"
4," write very few reviews but this book deserves every five star review and then some.  I found it to be a beautiful story.  When so much of what we read, hear, see, and watch is extravagent and looking to top the thing before it, this book finds brilliance in simplicity.  This story is anything but extravagent and is a story of characters, life, raw emotion, and love. Although I state simplicity, there is a great deal to analyze and discuss through the layers of complexity in this novel.  John Green, not only makes you ache for these characters, but he makes you miss them when the book is over and they are no longer a part of your life.  I hope that the acclaim this book is receiving continues and opens our eyes to the true artistry of writing.  Our world needs more art and culture like this novel."
5," But, Holy Cow with a Capital He-Ck!!Laughing, crying, laughing… the story this guy wrote, lemme tell ya… I couldn't decide if I should put it down or pick it up again. I love the characters, really care about them like I haven't been able to since… maybe, since ever.I knew it couldn't end in a fairy tale, and I wanted to stop in so many places so I could just remember them as they are, their selves in a snapshot I could glance at in my mind from time to time and just wonder, without having to know.It has been over a week since I finished the book. Took me about a week to savor… stop and start reading. I invested small portions of time and was still so involved with them each time I sat down.I am looking forward to reading the author's other stories."
5," The writing was intermittently interesting, beautiful and insightful. There were too many holes and patches of gloom. The theme just left me cold."
5," started reading this title as I had heard from numerous people that it was excellent. I was also intrigued to read it because of the upcoming movie. I have to say that the book lived up to my expectations. I was drawn in from page 1 with Green's realistic style of writing and in your face truth about all situations in this book.The Fault in Our Stars is filled with a realistic/truthful storyline, suspense, and twists. Green does a great job of getting you connected and vested in the characters. You really feel as if you are part of their journeys. Speaking from personal family experience with this subject matter (cancer) Green's writing was very true to life and the perils and triumphs that families face in the battles with cancer. A touching emotional read that you can't miss."
2," Absolutely love this book!! I laughed, I cried. I laughed until I cried. It's so beyond what I was expecting. After reading numerous reviews about this book on blogs, I finally caved and bought it. Best thing I've ever done. Well, book buying wise.The seriousness of Hazel's illness threw me off track of the obvious. (I shall not spoil) I cried and cried because this book is heartbreaking, but yet so much more. It's about life and death, love and happiness, family and friends.This is the second John Green book I've read. Once again, he pulled me in and made me think hard. Forget about everything but this book. That in itself, is genius. I'd recommend this book for anyone to read. This is not just a YA novel, it's every genre. Worth every second of your time and money."
5," love all of John Green's work and truly admire him as a person. But I was still surprised by how hard this book hit me.The Fault in Our Stars is not a happy book. It has happy moments, but there is this sense of tragedy that you just can't seem to shake. John Green's words pick you up and pull you in, past the intelligent dialogue and witticisms, to show you just how it feels to be dying and trying to live despite it.I cried continuously from page 99 onwards. I started reading the second I unboxed the book, and put it down only once, when I realised that I wasn't going to stop crying and should probably fetch my jumbo box of tissues.The sadness is unavoidable, but the story is so worth the tears. It is hauntingly real and beautifully insightful. This book will stay with you forever."
5," For one, I am not a realistic fiction reader. Especially teenage realistic fiction. In fact, I tend to stay away from it like it has the black plague. Because, most of the time, it's boring, tedious, and over dramatic to points it makes me sick.That being said, this is not that case.This book, is personally a favorite now. I loved it to pieces, and it was just..real.I've never even read any other books from this author, (Although I should, since we live in the same state. Have to show support, you know?) but his style completely caught me off guard. It's personally new to me, and I don't know if I'm the only one. I think it's mostly just because I've had my head in fantasy books for too long.This book is one of a kind. I recommend it to teenagers, and adults."
5," This story is about young adults with cancer, and much more.  The main characters, Hazel Grace Lancaster 16 and  a three-year stage IV-cancer survivor and  Augustus Waters 17, also a cancer survivor, meet at a cancer support group and have an instant connection. We follow these two and the people around them as they get to know each other and deal not only with their illness, and how everyone around them is also dealing with it. The story is well written, with a common interest bringing them together, and propelling them on a journey of discovery. The author gives us a view into not only the complicated issues of their illnesses but also into the joy of discovering one another, as normal teenagers would.This is the first book I have read by the author, but will not be my last."
2, Oh John Green you have amazed me yet again. Not once with Looking For Alaska but now twice with The Fault In Our Stars! I connected with theses characters on a deeper level. More than any character I've ever connected with in a story. I felt I followed them every where. That the were my friends in a nonfictional setting. I know these characters aren't of existence but my oh my do I wish they were. Hazel and Augustus's love is on a deeper level than I'm sure one would have been in the real world but it was still a magical feeling watching young cancer survivors fall head over heels in love with each other. I could not imagine the end of this book and when it came I felt a whole sadness wash over me like life just ended and for some it has...hint hint. Oh John Green write me more!
5," How can you not be pulled into a book where, from the first word, you are laughing so hard you are crying? Or is that crying so hard you're laughing? Both apply here.At first glance...yes. Seems maudlin, maybe. And yes, so brilliant.This is John Greene: he will make you laugh and cry and search your soul and find corners of yourself that you did not know existed. Don't come to this table wanting the Happily Ever After bubble. There are other books for that. But they won't make you laugh as hard. Like belly-pain laughter. And they won't change the way you see the world.Those HEA books are safe. This is not safe. But it is infinitely more rewarding.Even if you've lost friends like this.Especially if you've lost friends like this."
5," have literally read some parts of this book aloud to my friend and started crying because I remembered what Hazel went through and the way that Augustus says Hazel Grace. It's not my favourite book of all time, but it's up there because I really, really, really like it. It asks a lot of deep questions that makes me think and creates a narrative that I find myself engaging in.I really respect what John Green did in his book and I love the characters. The truths in this book on life and death are blunt but altogether very justified and beautiful.Loved the ideas. Loved the story. Loved the love. Loved Hazel Grace. Loved Augustus Waters. Loved their deep conversations. Loved the Okays. Overall, loved this book and will continue to love it."
5," was forced to read this for an upcoming adult book club gathering, so admittedly I am the wrong demographic.  Probably a teenager would adore it.  I thought it was mush."
5," This book is very heart touching and emotional, which I love in a book. If you don't laugh or cry while reading a book then you just haven't found the right book yet. And I think I've found the right book. This book tells the story of two teenagers with cancer, but this is not a cancer book. The Fault in Our Stars has changed my perspective on a lot of things. It taught me to look at things a whole new way. My mother read this book in 24 hours, when normally she wouldn't come near a book. Even if you aren't a reader, you'll fall in love with this amazing piece of literature. John Green has an outstanding writing ability, which you will learn. I strongly recommend reading this and more of Green's works of art.  Warning: Be prepared to sob uncontrollably while reading this novel."
3," This novel is amazing I must say. It really gets you thinking about life,the reasons why we long to love and be love,to know and understand what is beyond us, and so on. This author did a great job of  making the reader(me) feel what each character was feeling. He gave me a vivid picture,some I did not want to see. No not because it was to graphic, but because it pushed me to levels of empathy I didn't even know i had. Yes you will cry while reading and I mean like there will be a flow of tears you will not be able to stop. There's nothing literary that I do not find pleasing in this book. The only thing that made me upset...we'll you are going to just have to read it to find out...The reason why I call this my An Imperial Infliction....when you read it you will understand why."
5," read the first 30 pages, knew it was meant for a friend, so I passed it on to her (a voracious speed-reader), and then her daughter picked it up after she finished, and she took it home on the plane from Texas to Washington, DC.  Bought my 2nd copy, showed it to my daughter who is also in a book club, and she was hooked within 15 pages, so I'll finish the book once she gives it back.  Thank you to John Green for creating dialogue that sounds real, for sarcasm that makes readers laugh along with those whose illnesses are life threatening, for allowing hope to emerge in the worst circumstances.  I commend this book to anyone who wants a realistic entry into what it must be like to be terminally ill but still have the same feelings as those believing they are perfectly healthy."
5," Some books that I read, I can not get into that we'll because the writing style seems as though it is below my level. The Fault in Our Stars, thankfully, is perfectly written. It seemed as though I was living in the world that John Green so beautifully created. This book gave me the gift of tears and intense feelings that most movies simply can not. These words do not do this book enough justice and most likely no one will read this review, but if you do I just hope you take the chance to read the book that inspired it. I am not a cancer survivor, currently battling with cancer, nor has anyone I am very close to had cancer, but I feel as though this book portrays this sad world not seen by many perfectly. Enjoy this book. It is a wonderful treat I am glad to have experienced."
5," When this book was released there was a huge rave about the book and I never truly understood why... Until I read the book!  This book is pure genius it is well written, with a truly heart warming and gripping story. It is without a doubt the best book I have ever read!  The story tells of Hazel Grace a teenage girl living with cancer and it tells you of her love for Augustus Waters and speaks of her journey.  John green has produced a fantastic novel with this one!  I myself have never read a book more than once however, this shall be one of those books I will reach for throughout my entire life.  This book is a must read but be warned it is a very emotional book so if you leave the house with the book also leave with a pack of tissues at hand!"
5," This story will break your heart and restore it many times, each with more savagery then the last. This was a much needed tale of hope and endurance, pain and love, and the way they all go hand in hand. Although this was categorized as a teen book, I wholeheartedly disagree, I am 44, and this has inspired me to see my life differently, to view every day a gift, no longer thinking of my age as a curse, but a gift. A tangible gift, that belongs to me and all who know and love me. From this day forward, I will miss Augustus and Hazel Grace, as if I knew them, because I did know them. No one who reads this book can finish it unaffected by the characters, their story. I've read hundreds of  books, maybe a thousand, but THIS ONE IS TRULY EXCECPTIONAL, definitely in my TOP 5."
2," This book deserves so much more than I will ever be able to tell anyone. The way this book touched me is a way that no author has ever done before. The sheer reality and honesty this book shares with its readers is by far the most wonderful heart break I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing. This book allowed me to go on a journey with amazing people and experience love and loss, all while I was able to clutch on to a tissue as I felt for each character in this novel. Even if you aren't a fan of reading, I highly recommend that you allow Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters the chance to change your mind. This novel is more than that in my eyes. It's a window into the heart and mind of two young people who fell in love the way you fall asleep, slowly then all at once."
5," My roommate couldn't finish this book because she said it felt like Green was just trying to make her cry. While it's true I did cry while reading this in multiple spots, I never felt manipulated into crying. It was so wonderfully written. I'm not one to read teenage cancer stories - which is apparently a real genre, not just one discussed in this book - but The Fault in Our Stars is definitely more than that. It's a love story. It's a story of a family's struggles. It's the story of hope and perseverance. It's the story of disappointments both large and small. It's a story about needing a real ending.Be prepared to cry, for sure. But also be prepared to be shaken, to be happy, to get angry, to highlight almost every line for some nugget of wisdom."
5," John Green's The Fault In Our Stars could possibly be the greatest book I have ever read on the face of the planet.  It's coming pretty close to Harry Potter, and that's seriously saying something!!  But I bought the book, and I'm currently re-reading it--over and over--like a mad woman.  And although it is gloriously written with intricate details and is incredible to all measure, it does turn you into an emotional wreck.  So I suggest, that if you do decide to read this brilliant piece of art, please be careful.  When you've finished it and refuse to see the light of day, and cry continuously on a never ending loop, clutching the book to your chest wondering if you'll ever stop hurting, know that you've been warned... But read it.  Please do.  You won't regret it."
5," This book is truly amazing, I love the way the writer wrote this novel in a form of an autobiography. I have grown very fond of Jack Green's books lately. I bought this book several days ago and I couldn't help but finish it, yes, it's that good! I wonder though, what happens to Hazel? does she die out of cancer or what? did the doctors finally find a cure to help her out? and what happens to Peter? does he die out of intoxication or does he finally write a sequel? this book is definitely one of my favorite books yet. If you are looking for a book that contains the story of two star-crossed lovers and their journey through life, then you should definitely give this book a read.PS. I am sorry if I have bad grammar, English is not my first language :)"
5," This book is like few I've read - the kind where you can't help but see the world differently when you've finished, you keep the characters with you as you move about your day...hearing their witicisms as you experience life through a lens altered by them. I've not read a book that reduced me to a tear soaked mess and made me smile alternately on each page. From the start, I could not put this book down. I read it in bed, in restaurants, and finally cried myself silly on an airplane(the person next to me surely believes I'm emotionally disturbed). Yet it was so gripping, so observant, so truthful and yet impossibly funny that I'm hoping it's not morbid of me to name my first child Gus, and then I immediately imagine the quip he'd respond to that with."
5," There are only two books that come to mind when I think of how much I enjoyed them AND how much I cried while reading them. The first one is Bridges of Madison County, the second, The Fault in Our Stars. Yes, the young people in this book are impossibly brilliant, as evidenced by their unlikely dialogue. But it doesn't matter, because the characters and story are so engaging and interesting, you just want to keep reading. The prose is well written, almost too well written, as I had to look up new vocabulary words fairly often. But I don't profess to be a genius and I like a book that challenges my intellect. This book is categorized as young adult fiction. My young adult daughter encouraged me to read it and I'm glad I did. Just keep the tissues handy."
5," The Fault In Our Stars deals with two young cancer patients--and so much more.  It is about the love between parents and their children, love between teenagers, and love between friends. It is about the grief that precedes loss, and the grief that follows.  It is about thoughts of the possibility of immortality, and the possibility of annihilation.In these and in so many other situations, John Green gets it right. In the last eighteen months, I have lost my father, mother, and husband to cancer.  Improbably, I have also fallen in love. Every few pages I was highlighting a line or a paragraph because the words expressed so precisely how I felt and what I thought.No wonder Time Magazine chose The Fault in our Stars as its #1 novel of 2012!"
5," Without a doubt, a beautiful book. Moments of funny mixed with moments of sadness just like life. Grab your tissues."
5,"m a 66-year-old-woman, happily married but with no children. Although this book is described as being for young adult readers, I think that's not entirely accurate. The existential questions about life, love, illness and death that are asked by these young characters and their acute observations (as well as those of their parents and the other adults in the book), make this an incredibly worthwhile read for anyone who has ever loved another human being. The sharp humor--some of it of the gallows variety--just adds to the richness of the experience. I simply adored this book from start to finish and can only wish I had met these marvelous young people in person. Do yourself a favor and get acquainted with characters you'll remember for a very, very long time."
5," This book is just amazing. That one words sums it up but still does it no justice. I found out about this book and author through, sadly enough, One Direction blogs. I read reviews of this book being amazing, but still doubted it because only too often do I find myself reading a book that I find absolutely awful but everyone around me is in love with it. The problem with all the other 'amazing' books is that they're too simple. Their simplicity is boring. This book wasn't simple or boring. It actually told a story that meant something, not just 'okay here's a plot, let's write it down and publish it', but it was a story that actually spoke to me. It was as much of an emotional story as it was a physical story. So I would just like to say thank you John Green."
2," am sure my fiance thinks I am a lunatic now that he sat next to me this weekend as I laughed, cried and blew my nose all in one breath. This book killed me. But that is ok, I chose for it to. This was a wonderful story, so full of life. Not the perfect, fairy tale mush. This was raw and real. When my friends recommended this book to me I asked, why would I ever want to read such a sad story?! After all, it's the whole reason I avoid Nicholas sparks! But after so much ranting and raving I finally took the leap and fell hard into the pages of this book and am so happy for it. Congratulations, John Green, you can now add another fan to your list. This book taught me so me so much, opened my eyes and put life into perspective. Read this. You won't regret it."
5," Okay, first I never write reviews on anything. This book is by far the best book I've read in a looonnnggg time. Its a bout a girl named Hazel, who has thyroid Cancer that spread to her lungs, she is view by her mom as depressed and is forced to go to Cancer support group. She meets Augustus Waters, heart throb, blue eyed beauty. He is instantly attracted to her. I don't want to give much a way, but I can say that this is my all time favorite book! This book is witty, romantic, heartbreaking, a feel good book. I read this book in one day, stayed up til 2 in the  morning finishing it. Had a good cry while reading this, one of those ugly cry's, the ones that you hope no one ever see. I would recommend this book to anybody, and everybody. Good job John Green."
5," Lured by such a widespread reader acclaim I selected this storyIt is about two American teenagers from Indiana, who are terminally ill with cancer, and fall in love after they meet in a Church Support Group. The author intended to make a moving tearful story, and throw a  philosophical debate with universal questions about love, life and deathWith the exception of a few pieces of wisdom, the rest of the book, was inconsequential. I was not moved, I did not find the main characters quite well developed; and saw the secondary somewhat ludicrous.After I finished the book, my mind was a total blank.Sometimes a good review reader rating does not guarantee that a book will suit your preferences and for me this is a crystal clear example"
5," have read this book twice, yet I am still astounded of how amazing John Green is at capturing the essence of love and loss. My grandfather died from cancer and my mother is battling cancer, a cancer I am likely to acquire before I turn 40 (I am 13) , and I must say that Mr. Green is so accurate on how people feel when they've been diagnosed and how people react because of a diagnosis and an imminent death. TFIOS is a beautiful book, written from the perspective of an unwillingly pitiful heroine who falls in love with an unwillingly pitiful, metaphorical boy who hides his vulnerability under his awesome wit. This book is a must read for those wanting a true representation of love and grief, and to those who aren't afraid to shed (a rainstorm of) tears."
3," was so skeptical about this book, chosen by my book club. I didn't want to read about cancer. I didn't want to be sad. But like teen pregnancy in the movie Juno, cancer doesn't seem to be the main point, but rather the instrument the writer uses to get you to understand so many other life lessons, philosophical notes, etc. I couldn't stop reading it - not because it was an easy beach read, but because it haunted me. I thought about the sentiments the characters discussed all the time. The topic seems sad, but I couldn't stop smiling at how beautiful it all was - from the rich story and understated, intelligent characters to the poignant quotes and layers of underlying thoughts. I can only hope that if I ever write a novel, it measures up to this one."
5," This book is a quick read, but a good one. John Green's story is about a teenage girl diagnosed with cancer who goes to a support group (for other teenagers with cancer) and manages to fall for a boy she meets there, despite her wishes to not even go the group in the first place. The pair quickly fall for one another and share an amazing adventure to add to their presumably short life stories, but it's really much more. They have accepted their prognosis's and together they learn how to reveal to their families the true meaning of living life beyond their diagnoses and being more, and having more. Wise beyond their years. You will laugh and you will cry, and perhaps you will see your everyday life just a little differently. Definitely worth the read."
5,"t will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it will make you want to read it again. In some of the bad reviews people said that Hazel and Augustus spoke to maturely to have been teenagers and didn't act like teenagers. I would expect a young cancer patient to be more mature than your average teenagers, your maturity level is made up of things that you experience and the way you react to those things. The characters in this novel are flawless and I would not change  a thing about it, if the novel were about a teenage girl with cancer that drowns in self pity no-one want to read it. I couldn't wait to sit in the quiet and just read this novel for a couple of hours at the end of my day.Yours Truly,A Young Adult With A Chronic Disease"
4," found this book well written and difficult to put down, however it was extremely sad and at times it was difficult to believe the characters as it seemed a bit contrived. As another reviewer mentioned, these teenagers quote poetry and understand metaphors but are awkward and cynical at the same time. I think the most disappointing thing about this novel is that it is pretty hopeless. There are multiple references to oblivion and the belief that there is no afterlife by the main character. This is not a feel good book, so if that is what you are looking for, look elsewhere. If there were half star ratings, I would have given it 3.5 stars as it was an interesting book. I too just didn't understand all the hype. Think I will skip the movie as well."
5," This book was amazing. It was an honest surprise. The writing style and point were very different than most are used to. This is a story about teenagers with cancer. Many have reviewed this book as being unrealistic for a teenager perspective. However, I think that is up for debate. The kids in this book are diagnosed with cancer before they are old enough to drive. They are forced into the seclusion of the cancer world and find their own personal and very honest philosophies on what life is and what life is about. Personally, with a family member having cancer and going through these things now, I will say, this story lightened and broke my heart in a very personal way. I highly recommend this book. The writing style was different, but amazing."
5," don't know what I was expecting when I started reading this book but I am now filled with a deeper appreciation for the love of my life and a deeper understanding of the fight my own father had with cancer.The characters reminded me of people I have met in real life and it was a reminder that anyone wishing they had such a terrible affliction for attention or pity must not truly understand how the disease affects all that are involved.  Cancer perks are not something to be envied.All in all an excellent read that I could have finished in one sitting but chose to savor, which is the only logical thing to do when the characters are afflicted as they are. Of course the author's prose can be slowly enjoyed of plowed through"
2," This book deserves a million stars, but that's not an option on this device. ;)But in all seriousness, this book made me laugh and cry and is just pure perfection. John Green has captured my heart yet again with his amazing writing. He created perfect characters with such unique personalities and perspectives on life that you don't see much anymore. It was refreshing. No one knows how much I hate John Green for just ripping my heart and then backing over it with a heavy truck. (Joking! Obviously!)This book is worth all of your money and I'm not going to spoil it. All I can say is that it is pure perfection. It's an awesome book with ideas and views on cancer that not a lot of authors have captured. Definitely a must read."
5," read a review somewhere that said cancer was just the backdrop that fueled the love story. To that review I give a side-eye. This book discusses cancer alot. Cancer, cancer, cancer. Cancer here, there, and everywhere. And it's not the fairy tale cancer where at the end of the story everyone is cured and no scars remain. It's real cancer. But, true enough, the cancer made the love story that more touching.  I liked that the author didn't write the story in a way that seemed he was reaching for tears (even though I sobbed twice). I also loved how funny it was. It was actually really funny given the subject matter. I laughed a lot at the characters observations amidst the worst moments in their life. Hazel, Augustus and Isaac are quite the trio."
5, Am On a Roller Coaster That Only Goes Up. I don't believe you get to live in the clouds once you die. I believe that all people rest in peace and are surrounded by love. Surrounded by your own thoughts. Your head up in the clouds. Love can be faraway or close but no matter where love is love them the same amount. Grief didn't change anybody. It reveals them. I enjoyed this rather mournful romance. I honestly think that was the best publication I have ever read. I just didn't know what to read and when I picked up this book I could not stop reading. My mom recommended the book to me after I found it while searching for a new book to read. I couldn't believe my luck. I love a good romance. After all the fault is not in our stars but ourselves.
5," After four hours and a role of toilet paper to blow my nose and wipe my eyes, I completed this book.  I cried from the first to the last page.  It was very well  written and all the characters in the book were I am so intelligent and witty and if you don't get my jokes than you probably are not very smart type of characters, but since it was pretty easy to understand, it left me, the reader, feeling very smart and part of the exclusive smart and witty group.I read this after my 16 year old son recommended it to me, and my 17 year old daughter started to read it.  While it is definitely a teenager genre,  I thoroughly enjoyed it myself...... and lets face it, some times there is nothing better than a good cry."
5," Every concept I've ever had has been blown away by this amazing book. It's a hilarious-heartbreaking-tear inducing-smile producing-mind altering-love story that has nothing to do with you but everything to do with anything you've ever felt, ever thought,  ever known. This book captures the very essence of life in its portrayal of death and his colleagues: sickness and health, pain and emptiness, and absolutely everything in between. The description on the upside flap of the book can not prepare you for the roller coaster ride of emotion you're going to experience. Just sit back, get comfortable, and then immerse yourself into the world of Hazel and Augustus, allow your mind and theirs to intertwine, and then fall in love again and again."
5," heard amazing reviews about this book starting several years ago. I bought the physical book, and it sat on my shelf. I bought the Kindle book, and it sat in my iPhone book list. I knew it was going to end sadly. I knew it was about kids with cancer, and I didn't want to be sad. Finally, tonight, I decided I was okay with being upset in exchange for some amazing writing. And then I laughed. I am writing this review, spoiler-free, to tell everyone who doesn't feel like reading a sad, star-crossed lovers, first-teenage-love, people-die story, that this book is different. The tone of the narrator, Hazel, is wry and provokes laugh-out-loud moments. Don't be afraid to read this book. You will cry, but you will not feel bad after reading it."
5," My wife recommended this one to me back when it debuted two years ago, and now that the movie is playing in theaters and it's is all over the news again I thought it was time to finally check it out. I was afraid the hype would be too much though. Thankfully, not. The Fault in Our Stars by John Green is an elegant love story of joy, heartbreak, and what we do with the time we're given.There are so many points where the narrative could have gone south—turning melodramatic, cliché, or just plain schmaltzy. But it doesn't. Green's characters feel like real teens just trying to live life to the fullest despite also battling cancer. Hazel especially is as authentic as any living person could be given her extreme circumstances."
5," Amazing. This book really moved me and made me look at the world in a whole new way. I feel that by reading this book, readers will gain a whole new perspective on the world around them, and see just how impacting each and every action they make really is. Readers may also learn a lot about themselves after reading this book. It really makes you think about how important your life here is, and what kind of legacy you want to leave behind. Everyone will leave a footprint, some larger than others. But how important is it, really, to leave behind a big footprint? Why not live presently, and absorb everything the universe has to offer? I recommend this book to practically everyone I speak to, and I recommend it to you reading this now."
5," This book spoke to me in ways Young Adult books haven't in years. I thought it was funny, touching, and horribly sweet. But not so sweet that it gave me diabetes. For all of those saying that the way that Augustus and Hazel spoke isn't how teens spoke missed the whole point. Of course teens without cancer or some serious illness do not speak that way. Augustus and Hazel and Issac for that matter spoke that way because they HAD to grow up quickly. The whole reason that Hazel's friend even exists is to point that out to the reader. While teens are faking adult hood these sick, amazing kids are just trying to feel some semblance of normality.I thank John Green for writing a book that is seeped in reality for the YA genre."
5," John Green's The Fault in our Stars was a very unique read. When I first heard the plot of the story before reading it, I wasn't sure how I would feel about it. I'm not normally one for dark, sad, emotional books, especially in the Young Adult group. However I figured I'd give it a try, and I'm SO glad I did! Wow! The story of these two teenagers battling one of life's scariest scenarios is absolutely chilling. The most amazing part of this book, however, is not the terrifying idea of kids with cancer and how they deal with it. It's how light-hearted and fun the writing was, in spite of the dense topics. The book still made me laugh out loud, when I only expected to cry. This was absolutely phenomenal, I recommend it to everyone."
2," This book will go down as one of my top 5 favorite books ever.I am the mother of a bone marrow transplant survivor (transplanted at age 1) and am about to go through the transplant process again with my second child. I have interacted with SO many cancer patients of all ages. As a semi-young (28) mother I always felt connected to the tween and teen cancer and bone marrow transplant patients that we got to know while living in the hospital.This book allowed me to really understand a lot of the real life issues teen cancer patients, especialyl terminal patients, experience. I am so thankful that this book allowed me to further connect, and minister to, such a determined, special, and amazing group of people."
5," This is by far the best book I've ever read. I don't even know what to say. It's simple, yet extraordinary. The beginning as interesting as the end. You never want to take your eyes of the next page, nor did I want to finish it. I could have finished it in 2 days but when I got to 97% I realized I really didn't want it to be over. So I didn't read it again until 2 weeks later. The ending. Oh my. I'm not going to spoil it though. So you can keep reading.(: There was never a boring point in the book. Ever! There was always a twist that you never saw coming, nor would have you seen in a million years. I want to be a writer. I've never really had a favorite author. But now I think John Green is my new favorite author. He's amazing."
5," This book is amazing in so many different ways. I can honestly say that I'm not a reader, nor a cryer. I bought this book late Tuesday Night on Amazon Kindle, started reading it Wednesday, and finished at 2 am of Thursday morning. I also want to add that at 2 am in my bed all alone, I was bawling my eyes out. This is something that doesn't happen regularly. I can't even remember a time when I've cried in a movie, let alone a book. So here is my wish: that readers and non-readers can experience the same rawness and magnificence that I did. I am feeling like I should go out and read more books to find another book that can even come close to measuring up to TFIOS. John Greene, this book is the best book I've ever read. Thank you!"
5," You can't help but fall in love with Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters despite the fact that you don't want to. You don't want to because you know you're going to lose them. But this book proves that it's better to have loved and lost than to have never have loved at all. Green has created two witty, beautifully-tragic, funny characters that are sure to stay with you long after closing on the final page. You know this because your chest hurts when you finish. And, yet, you feel uplifted. It's a tremendously acrobatic emotion that Green creates inside the reader. And, for that, he deserves much praise and all the success. Thank you, Mr. Green for writing a story so full of love and lovable characters that it makes the reader ache."
5," This book was amazing. I normally can't find a good book to read, as I, being the  picky person I am can never find an interesting enough book. But this book was more than interesting, it was moving. I don't normally read a 300+ page book in under 5 hours, but today I did. I shaved my head and raised nearly 3,000 dollars for show my support for cancer research and I did those things  because I really feel for those people who know someone who lost their battle with cancer and the cancer patients themselves. But anyway if you need a romantic and at the same time, moving book to read, or just a book to read that opens your eyes too the world that we live in, this is the book to read. I promise you you will not be disappointed."
5," am dismayed by all the hype surrounding this book.  It is trite, contrived, overwrought, pretentious and not an accurate depiction of the cancer experience.  Augustus and Hazel embark on a doomed romance that is predictably fated to end in tragedy, but I never felt the chemistry that they were supposed to have between them.  There was no genuine emotion, just the endless witty  repartee that grew more wearying and eye-roll inducing.  I may be too old for this book and admittedly not the target audience, but I purchased it expecting an earnest story of love and loss.  Instead, it is a book that tries too hard to seem glib, edgy and profound.  I truly wanted to like this book, but found very little substance here."
5," When I got the book in the mail I literally sat down and read it the whole way through in 6 hours (minus a bathroom break and dinner). I laughed, I teared up, and I really did relate. I'm 23 now, but when I was 20 I was diagnosed with cervical cancer and I remembering being one of those deep minds trapped in a teenage body. This spoke to me all many levels of my human experience so far.This is really one of the most enjoyable books (not just cancer book) that I have ever read. I whole heartily recommend this book, or at least give it a shot and see if you like it. As per the overflowing amount of 5 star reviews show, it is a worthwhile book regardless if you are a young adult, affected by cancer, or a brooding individual."
2, Very witty writing. I don't want to say what has already been said but It's a great book. Not just for youths.
5, Such a great book. My 15 year old daughter has read it more than once. I am so glad she pointed me towards it.
5," a rollercoaster that only goes upJohn Green is truly an amazing author. His words are just so eloquent and captivating. The story makes you feel such raw and real emotions. I cried and laughed and cried even more. THIS is what contemporary fiction should be. Having known people who have had cancer and how much it takes a toll on the people you love, this one was especially hard to get through but I would have kicked myself if I had never read it. And it would shock me so if, after having read this book, you did not shed a few tears. Me? Let's just say I was on the verge of being torrential. Anyway... READ. THIS. BOOK. Because it would be a shame if you never experienced the beauty of what was written on these pages..."
2," After hearing quite a bit about John Green on tumblr, I decided to pick up one of his books at a local book store. I am very picky when it comes to reading, and when I find a book I like, you cannot pull me away from it until I completely finish it. By the first page I was hooked and ended up reading the whole of it in a day. Warning, if you are as empathetic, as I am, you will cry. And when I say cry, I mean huge racking sobs. I ended up breaking out the tissues, which does not happen often. What I love most about this book is that it felt real. The author has an amazing way of bringing the characters to life, something not many have now days. This will now be the book I recommend when someone asks what to read next."
5," Even though this is fictional literature, it has some valuable insights. I feel readers will have a unique peek at how your dear ones may be looking at life and how some of them may reflect on what matters to them after they leave our world. Each individual is different, but there are some common reflections.  I agree with the notion that one does find “the best people” in your life when you are in those dark days of losing a loved one.  Read it and see the movie, but don’t the qualifying factor, whether you cried to be a determining factor of its worthiness.  Instead read it, reflect on the messages and then live each day sharing &amp; showing the love you have for your loved one…value the time that you have together."
5," This is practically the best book I've ever read, and that's saying a lot, because I've read so many books that I've loved. When I was reading this book, I felt like I was inside the book living Hazel's life, like I've known her forever. It took me some time to find words to put in this review, but I finally found them. Still, there is no word to explain how much I absolutely loved this book. John Green did a wonderful job writing this book. If you took time to read this, then you know this is an utterly amazing, beautiful book, and you should take time to read it and view people with diseases/disorders differently and better. Thanks for taking time to read this review, and I hope you read this book. ENJOY! (I did)"
5," WOW. I absolutely love John Greens writing! And his ability to write in a teenage girl's POV? Impressive! I was laughing so much through out this book at Hazel and Augustus humor. This book will definitely make you laugh....and cry! But it is one that I could pick up and read over and over again. Great work.We are literally in the heart of Jesus, he said. I thought we were in a church basement, but we are literally in the heart of Jesus.Someone should tell Jesus, I said. I mean, it's gotta be dangerous, storing children with cancer in your heart.I would tell Him myself, Augustus said, but unfortunately I am literally stuck inside of His heart, so He won't be able to hear me."
5," The Fault In Our Stars is an intelligent, compassionate and, in its way, a very beautiful book. Clearly, we are all under a death sentence but it is very different for the adolescents with terminal illnesses who look at the world of adults and know the joys of adult life will never be theirs. I also think this book is an excellent argument for parents to stop poisoning their children with fairy tales of a beneficent god and the insane notion that everything happens for a reason. As Augustus said - We live in a universe devoted to the creation, and eradication, of awareness... a victim - as you will be - of the universe's need to make and unmake all that is possible. All we can do is try to enjoy the ride."
5," The Fault in Our Stars is full of truth, hope, humor, friendship, and beautiful characters that you wish you personally knew.  John writes beautifully...so many sentences I re-read over and over.  TFIOS explores the idea of self-sacrifice and nobility, the idea of individual heroism and the universe, how the smallest quirk and the grandest, most metaphorical gesture hold the same weight in love and friendship.  Every once in awhile, but not nearly often enough, a book comes along that you must finish reading no matter what the time of night, or morning, and in spite of the next full day facing you after the deficit of sleep you will suffer because you couldn't close the treasure that you hold in your hands."
5," This book, I could tell, was going to be sad. Its two leads, Hazel and Augustus, meet in a cancer support group where the unnecessary suffering and mortality of sick children is always the main topic. But this is a love story. Because love is always fleeting, only as infinite and forever as lives are, as the world is, as the universe is. Green's book is about that, about grasping what we can while we can - even in a place where everything ends - because love is beautiful, powerful and because it occasionally asserts itself even when it would be better not to have heartbreak and disappointment. Gus and Hazel - wonderful characters - learn that. I was grateful to read this and be reminded. Highly recommended."
5," Could not become interested in the story, although I tried. The author surely tried, but to me it was a complete waste of time."
5, This book centers on the lives of teenagers that are dealing with life threatening and life altering cancers.  I especially enjoyed the way the story was told.  Not from an outsider's point of view but from the sarcastic and overwhelmingly truthful kids themselves.  The characters come to life and you learn to love them and feel pain for them and admire them all at the same time.  They are honest in their recognition of life.  The book is said to have more appeal to a younger crowd but I didn't find it that way. The book is a great fast read with a look into the lives of teenage characters that are not different from your own children just different because of an unfortunate Fault in their Stars.
5," liked this book, I really did. It was well written, and it made me both laugh and cry. But being close to Hazel' s age myself, I didn't appreciate Mr. Green' s use of language to make the teens sound more authentic. Every other paragraph, it seemed, was filled with swear words. There's also a intense make out scene that was quite blush-worthy. Hazel also states a disbelief in God, (though Agustus tells her otherwise). So, if you're looking for an innocent read, this  might not be it. Still, I did enjoy the details Mr. Green packed the book with, and the calmness with which he writes the most dramatic scenes, making them feel even more intense. It reminded me of Gone With The Wind meets Romeo and Juliet."
2," had the blessing of surviving a pediatric cancer as an adult. As an outside insider, I watched families undergo the greatest of hardships with both a sense of compassion and relief (thankful it was me in treatment and not my daughter). While every family and patient suffers as they undergo this challenge, I felt a special kind of heartbreak for teenagers in treatment -- they are old enough to understand their mortality and yet, their friends are not mature enough to really get whats going on.Teenagers are already feeling alienated, add cancer on top of that and there are few works that express that kind of heartbreak. And even less can express it in a way that is as enjoyable as this book."
4, The dialogue was far-fetched to the point of being distracting. It was especially hard to imagine teenagers saying most of it.
5," absolutely live this book! I am a huge john green fan I'm 14 and I think it's a good book for teens and adults alike. Th only thing I would like to put out there is that I was instantly attached to hazel, Gus and of courses Isaac, but was so sad and disappointed when Gus died. You see my great grandmother died 4 years ago from from cancer that had spread throughout her whole body, and her daughter my grandmother, is in remission from her second fight with brain cancer! I thank God everyday that she's here with and I cherish every moment with her. So Gus dying really awakens the sadness of my great grandmother. Overall I thunk this book is a funny romantic incredibly well thought out and I live it!"
1," So The Fault in Our Stars doesn't sound like a book I would read or enjoy, but I loved it. A girl who's terminally sick with cancer meets a boy. They fall in love, but bad sad things happen. I won't spoil anything because what happens is not what you're thinking will happen. It's such a great story full of funny true genuine characters with quirks and amazing dialog and emotional memorable scenes. You'll leave this book remembering a lot of the scenes from it. Most books I finish and think back on and remember a couple cool moments - this book is full of them. The emotions of the characters are portrayed so well. Their story is sad but it's also inspiring and amazing. I highly recommend this book."
5," My older daughter read this book, and told my younger daughter, You HAVE to read this book. My younger daughter read it, and told me most urgently, You ABSOLUTELY have to read this book, RIGHT NOW.But I knew it was a sad book. Why, I asked, should I read a book that will make me sad?Because it's sad in a good way. You have to read it!Well, once again, my daughters were right. This is a wonderful book.It's a book about death that is frequently laugh-out-loud funny.It's a book about love, and about characters you quickly come to love.It's a book that's over too soon, and that lingers.You have to read this book."
5," This is one of the most beautiful books I've ever read. You smile, laugh and cry along with Hazel. I relate so much with this in between girl.All you want to do is put the book down as you are reading it because everything hurts, hurts so much you almost can't stand it (in fact I had to stop 4 times because I was crying too hard to read) but you can't. You mustn't you owe it to the characters to know what happens. You simply must know how they turn out.Van Houten was wrong though, these characters live on with me. It sounds cheesy but I think of them as people because they are; they are true people who have feelings, lives and friends and I will never forget their stories."
5,"ve read all of John Green's solo work - I love everything he has written.  This, though, is his best yet.  It's not quite as 'deep and emotional' as Looking for Alaska was, but it doesn't NEED to be.  It's hilarious, it's heart breaking, and it's short and sweet.  It only took me two sittings to read this, and I could have easily read the whole thing in one sitting had time been permitted.  Each page was filled with wit; there were absolutely no 'dry' sections in this book.Anyone who has an appreciation for witty humor and rich (but still warm and welcoming enough for the average reader) language should pick this book up.  It's absolutely beautiful.Thank you for writing this, John. DFTBA."
5,"m a mom of teenagers and read this book because of all the hype and the movie coming out. The hype was certainly truthful and I'm glad I took the time to read it. It was, a quick, easy read. It was like a friend telling you a story over coffee. Although lots of gobbledygook due to the pretentious intellect of the characters, you can weed thru it without a dictionary. I couldn't give the 5th star because I don't like books without a solid ending. The story, like the plot line the two were after in the book, was too cliche with the open ending. I wanted satisfaction at the end and closure and was just as frustrated as Hazel at the end. I don't understand why Green ended it that the way he did."
5," literally (yes, literally) just finished reading this book and I want to write my review while the emotions are still raw. One of the most amazing talents of authors is their ability to make the reader care about characters who do not exist. John Green's brings to life Hazel and Augustus in such a way that a visceral reaction to the story is impossible.Any good review should (I suppose) contain a critique or two. The only one to be made is that the plot turns out to be predictable, but really a story as touching and beautiful as this only has one path to follow.I highly recommend this book. Thank you John Green for writing this story (and for making me cry in public)."
5," have followed John since 2007 as a nerdfighter and have read all of his novels. I preordered this book and completed it the day it came out. I have re-read this book seven times and will re-read it more. I wish to find my own Augustus one day. I keep re-reading to fall in love with him again. I have not shared this book with anyone, since favorite books are special like that, however being a top seller makes that a tad useless. I am not happy about this book being a movie because with fame comes misuse and people who don't read books and see the movie to find out what it's about. With the movie will come more nerd fighters who aren't nerd fighters and it will make me sad. Truly yours, Anna."
2," This book inevitably changed my life. You see things from this perspective that mentally intrigues you with ease. And as I read this beautifully written masterpiece, an imprint has been made upon my moral and ethical values. I am a 16 year old aspiring writer who now understands what it takes to be a remembered author. You have to not just be able to  write to your readers,you must make them believe. The ungodly intelligent meteors that occurred through out the novel, the life lessons of death and the never ending love. The unbelievable idea of eggs only being discriminated as breakfast foods. This book will forever be my favourite piece of literature. Thank you for changing my life forever."
5, When ever there is buzz on an upcoming movie based on a book I always try to read the book firstSome books are great with awful movies (twilight)Some books are great  with great movies ( the perks of being a wallflower)This book is great x5 I'm interested to see how the emotion will be captured by the end of this book I was having the kind of cry that hurts your throat it was embarrassing because I was waiting for lunch meat at the deli in Publix so having a giant ugly cry while waiting for Virginia baked ham may have been lame if you read this please do it in the privacy of your home cause if your anywhere in public you will be embarrassed hope the movie does it justice
5," This was by far the most tear jerking, heart warming, awful, mean, sweet,and funny book that I have ever read. How can books be mean? Well, bends the fact that I cried throughout the whole second part of the book. My feelings were quite hurt to be honest. In the sense that I read this book in matter of hours, I was white offended whenever I got to the last page. I turned the page and my heart sank. I was no longer reading one of the best books ever written. It was an awful feeling. Sure I can go back and read the book again but it will never be the same.  I will never get that awful but amazing feeling of finishing the b look that completes mg life. So. Goodnight and Well Wishing to all."
5," This was, in all, a heartbreaking story with a slightly predicable ending. However, I enjoyed the overall attitude of this book and just the way that John Green writes. He seems to write in a language that most teens can recognize and relate to. I thought the emotions are to be described as simply raw, and this aspect greatly contributed to the book and the feelings that the reader got from reading it. Despite the two teens having cancer, i thought the lessons from the book are relatable to all audiences. The book was a quick to read and was totally worth the week i spent on it. It's a book that will always stick in the back of my head somewhere, reciting the sarcastic and witty quotes."
5," A story that, by description, doesn't sound that great (kids, cancer, star-crossed lovers, etc.) but is an engrossing read.  Well written, great characters, little twists and turns, idiosyncratic authorial viewpoint, all adds up to great book.  In lesser hands this could have been a mushy, tugging at the heart-strings tearjerker, and while it does make you question the concept of fairness in life, neither the story nor the characters are allowed to spend too long feeling sorry for themselves.  Though I think they would have a right to.I see this is often described as Young Adult or ChickLit.  Well I don't qualify in either criteria (I'm male, 55) but I thoroughly enjoyed it."
5," Oh my god this book was amazing. I pretty much read through the last one hundred pages before allowing myself to even think about going to sleep. Let me assure you, it is well past my bed time. I met John Green last year and got him to sign The Fault in Our Stars before I realized how big of a deal he actually is and I'm glad I did. I fell in love with him through his VlogBrothers videos before I fell in love with his writing in this book. The man is an artist with his writing. I adore his style and will eventually read his other books as well. I must now wrap up this review because, as I've already stated, it's past my bedtime and I'm now very sleepy. Good night and go read this book!"
5," was really surprised to see that my copy arrived two days before it was supposed to, and when opened my copy looked perfect not a bend on the cover!This book has not only helped me grasp a new understanding and view of teenage romance but it has also has made me ask myself questions I never dared to ask myself before. Questions like, will I ever find love? Will I leave a mark on this world? Will my life be remembered for generations to come? Or will I mean nothing to anyone after I die?I really do recommend this book to anybody looking for a romance, comedy, humiliation, and great devastation. Beware of the heartbreaking ending that surely awaits every reader."
5," Firstly I'll say I'm not much of a reader but out of boredom while out at a field training exercise in the Army and out of recommendation from my sister I decided to give this book a try. It is a good story and very well written, certainly worth a read if you got the time. Sometimes it seems a little too well written especially considering the characters are 16 and 17 years old, some of the words they used I never even heard of! Lol. Also, this book could be for anyone it is not too girly but defiantly not the macho manly stuff I am used to. It gives a great insight into life, death, and young love. If a 22 year old male Army Soldier can enjoy it, I'm sure you can too! Give it a try!"
5," To be honest, I almost didn't read it when I found out it was for young adults, and being 28, I thought it would be a little on the youg side for me. Needless to say, I'm really glad I gave this book a chance. I read it in a day and loved every page. I'm really excited to see the movie when it comes out in June, but I have a feeling it may not do this great book justice. I just started reading another John Green book, and I have high expectations for that one because of this book! This book made laugh, and it made me cry. I felt the love that Hazel and Augustus felt for each other.. it was very apparent. What a great book! This will definetely be one I read again and again!"
5," Green can write, but this novel has problems.  How could our plucky heroine not like V for Vendetta and not appreciate its heroine Evie and completely miss the movie's larger message?  No, she's obsessed with a book she read as a younger girl that stops mid-sentence.  And 300 has one of the steamiest sex scenes this side of pornography that Hazel somehow misses (but I'll bet Gus didn't).  The frank talk about cancer is refreshing and rings true.  Even Van Houten's super-saturated scholarly superiority speech rings true, but no one gives him another thought when he fails' them.  This book reads like a soap with good dialogue.I'm not looking forward to the movie."
2," honestly walk around and tell people to read the book if they haven't. It's emotional and beautiful and meaningful. You don't get hurt and you don't arrive angry at the last page. It's not what you expect and it's everything that worries you in your somehow now joyful life. TFIOS is not just a modern book, it is a lesson to live by and love by. You leave upset at first, but then (if you're similar to me) a few days later you're filled with an overwhelming joy for the life you have and the empowering message of John Green's novel. I believe that fifty years from now, kids will read this for summer reading or school assignments and love it just as much as I do."
3," this book, I hardly know what to say. it is a mixture of tragedy, reality, and love. Augustus waters completely understood love. so what if Augustus is not with hazel, she still loves him the same. she did not fall in love with him on the condition that he would live longer than her. there are no conditions in love, so there shouldn't be any regrets. she is now alone not because she cannot find someone  else, but because loving Augustus makes her happy. LOVE IS LIKE Sex LIFE. IT MAY NOT BE EASY AND IT MAY NOT ALWAYS BRING YOU HAPPINESS, BUT IF WE DON'T STOP LIVING, THEN WHY SHOULD WE STOP LOVING? even after lovers have died their love with live on.  SOME LOVE STORIES LIVE FOREVER."
5," don't care if this book is sad. It is one of the best books I have ever read. Not only is it well written, it has taught me more about life than any other book. I have read other books about people dying of cancer but none of the others touched my heart like this one did. All of the other books had the main character having the same out look on life. They all were hopeful and wanting the best for what time they had left. I was glad to see the author bring a new point of view on what it is really like to live with cancer. I enjoyed reading Hazel's view point on what it is like to live with cancer. I highly recommend this book to everyone. But I warn you, I did cry multiple times."
5," The Fault in Our Stars is a love story, but not one that is romantic or uplifting.  The author has done a good job writing an engrossing book and trying to spice the tragedy of the story up with some dark humor and good natured characters, but this story is a sad one.This is the kind of book that might stay with a young reader for a lifetime, and not necessarily in a good way:  I am always cautious about elementary school aged children reading really dark subject matter because it does shape their thought process.  This book is undoubtedly dark.Still, this is a well-written book and is worth reading as long as you can tolerate the depressing subject matter."
5," No matter how much we ignore it, the truth is the truth. We all call our selves individuals but are we really. We all live the same life. We all mourn, we all cry, we all try to remember the good things but in the end only have scars. And it is with this truth that we can all relate to a book like this. Because within every piece of writing there is a piece of your life story. So I praise this book, because it made me laugh and cry, and made me realize that every time we read, were learning a piece of our future. And it might not make sense to you, but who really cares. We all live the same lives, only to different extremes. Some infinities are bigger than other infinities."
2," stand behind my pedestrian title. This book is a very good read. I can think of no finer example of a gripping, honest, emotionally-charged story, and say with confidence that John Green is currently the best young-adult writer around.On the surface, it's an over-used plot. But I feel like all that has to be said, has been said. But people are still falling in love, right? So if you're going to say something, say it well.And that's exactly what John Green does. He tells you a love story in honest, uncomplicated words that prove adolescence need not equate shallow, vapid existence. You can be profound, and relevant, and truthful in the bullsh_tless musings of a teenager."
5," Through many books I've stumbled upon in this life, this book has spoken to me. You will learn about a girl who loves a man but refuses to hurt him. Then a boy, who loves this girl for being her. He doesn't care about the tube, or the though of cancer because true love only exists when you find yourself but you need the other person to help. But the story has a twist. When you think life is bad, look at someone else's live and you might be healthier. This amazing book awakens the hearts of people to look at our heroes. The cancer patients, the people with diseases, the people lost in war are all heroes in this life. Just like the hero you are for having faults in your stars."
5," My.daughters were assigned this novel for summer reading before entering college in the fall. Curiosity got the better of me,and having logged 25 years as a middle school English teacher,reading a YA book was right up my alley. TFIOS has so many themes to explore, I Could make a wonderful unit using this book as a springboard for discussion. Overall, I found this book to be appropriate for its YA audience. I did have a problem with the author character attending Gus' funeral and then surprising Hazel in the minivan. It seemed a little far fetched and too convenient to  move the story along to its end. Other than that,, I enjoyed reading TFIOS  and I'm sure others will, took."
5," My 17 year old daughter started reading this book and could not put it down. I have always wished for her to love reading like I do. Loving a book so much that she could not put it down, thank you John, for  helping me with that wish. Although we know that the world is not a wish granting factory...sometimes people help wishes come true. Although I had never purchased a kindle audio book , I decided to purchase this in an audio book. After Angelica stayed up all night reading this book, we spent the day together listening to it. By the way,  the audio book was great, loved it! As for the story, we laughed out loud, cried and cherished the characters. Excellent book!"
5," This wasn't a terrible book, but it wasn't particularly good, either.  The author seemed to just want to play on people's emotions and make the reader sad without much character development behind it.  It reminded me a lot of Twilight, except with cancer instead of vampires.  The star-crossed teenage lovers have nothing in common, except for their inevitable untimely deaths, and their romance blossoms without any real relationship development.  Similar to Twilight, the male love-interest is portrayed as remarkably handsome, yet falls for the unremarkable narrator.  The narrator is portrayed as an awkward, self-conscious, introverted teenage girl who loves books and Chuck Taylors--basically allowing any sort-of-shy teenage girl to insert herself into the role and easily relate to the character.  The book was good enough for a quick read, but I think the author was very manipulative without offering very much plot substance."
5," This is a Young Adult book, and even though I'm an Old Adult, I read it to get a feel for the genre. The first chapter didn't impress me. The first person narrative of a sixteen year old girl with cancer seemed too mature and sophisticated. I kept reading it, however, and by the time I got to the middle, couldn't put it down. The writing gets better in the last half of the book, which is the reverse of what usually happens. So it's a twenty-first century Love Story brought down to high school level. At the halfway point, I predicted the ending, but even so, the ending was well done. It's a very sad story, so if you can't handle unhappy endings, it's not your cup of tea."
2," Some books make you Laugh....some books make you cry... and some books do both..... but then there are some books that hold your heart from the very beginning... you fall in love with the characters... they become a part of your heart.... they touch your soul.... and when the book ends... you don't want it to end.. but it does... and you know it's gonna end... and early on, you know how it's gonna end...and you know it's gonna take a piece of you with it to that end... and it does!  and now there is this emptiness in you heart...  and you sigh... and say wow.... what an amazing book.... I think I'll read it again.read this book people.... you will be glad you did!"
5," Time after time I would see a blue book sitting in Barnes in noble and would walk right past it, little did I know that the little blue book titled the fault In our stars would be the most amazing, beautiful, and impacting story I've ever read. LOTS of people ask me why I read, and they constantly tell me it's  a waste of time, well not for me, I read because it helps me escape, this book not only helped me escape, but also made me love, love! I know I wrote a lot but one last thing I'd like to say is CANCER SUCKS, but even though it sucks, cancer fighters don't complain, they just keep fighting I could never be that strong, so to those surviving cancer I admire you!"
5," Hazel is a sixteen year old girl who has more to deal with than lugging around an oxygen tank and trying to survive a rare form of lung cancer; she needs to save her parents, fall in love with a hot guy, endure incredible pain, and find a way to get to Amsterdam to meet the author of her favorite book to demand answers about imaginary characters !  John Green's writing is witty and crafted with tidbits of genius and insight.  The characters seem too real to ignore, and by the end I'm rooting for Hazel against all odds.  I'll recommend this book to all readers who can handle the idea of a misfit heroine with more courage and insight than her tender years should warrant."
5," John Green has done it! He has made me laugh, cry, and think deeply about the world all at the same time. The storyline, the plot, the characters, everything about this novel was pure genius. Thre is nothing not to love about Hazel Grace or Augustus Waters or our dear friend Isaac. This novel affected me so deeply that my horse is named Augustus(Gus for short) because of what a beautiful and wonderful character Augustus Waters is. John Green is most definately the greatest author  have had the pleasure of reading, and surpasses J. K. Rowling and other noted great authors by a landslide! If you have not read or enjoyed this book, there might be something wrong with you!"
2, ... I'm speechless it was amazing and I loved every single word in it. I hope some day I will be able to write a book full of power and strength and hopefully i will learn from it and if the author reads this i hope that you know that yo  changed my life and the way I look at it so I thank touching my whole heart for your inspiration and thoughts on cancer because I've had 2 family members died from its awful way of killing. My mom and 2 of my teachers have had it and I'm crying right now as I write this and I quote  I pray that some day I can be like hazel because i love her faith and how she always thinks of her future. And thanks again for sharing your inspiration
5," am glad I did not read the synopsis before I bought the book. Having lost someone very dear to cancer I usually stay away from this topic.This is a remarkable book. The extraordinary talent of Mr. Green resides in portraying cancer patients as people, not as their disease. His raw, bold and sometimes brutal writing is longed-for in a state of affairs where profound and poetic texts are not the norm but the exception.Agustus and Hazel will say with me for a long, long time....It seemed like forever ago, like we'd had this brief but still infinite forever. Some infinities are bigger than other infinities.Thank you Mr. Green."
5," This book will leave you emotionally scarred. I'd heard so many great things about this book and finally decided to read it. In a way, I wish I hadn't because I feel like before this book i was so careless to the world outside of my life. This book has opened my eyes to things I hadn't even thought of before. I thought the book Mocking Jay by Suzanne Collins was a depressing book but after The Fault In Our Stars, I am officially scarred for life. But in the best way. This book by far is my favourite book of all time. Thank you to the wonderful author that decided to gave the courage to right a book with Romance, suffering, death, and utter insanity all in one book."
5," Purchasing and reading this book has been one of best choices i have made! It is brilliantly written and incredibly addictive. I fell in love with each character and i cant simply stop reading it. I love the way John Green treats the topic of kids with cancer in the story and how there is no sugar coating the topic. Even if i was heartbroken by the passing of one of the main characters, i knew that there couldn't have been another way to end this story. Oh, and I'm totally obsessed with Hazel &amp; Augustus, there couldn't have made a better couple and i just simply love everything about them. I really recommend people to read this book. You will not regret buying it ;)."
5," listened to this on CD while driving. The audio was great. This story is about Hazel and Augustus Waters, two cancer patients that meet at support group in the `literal heart of Jesus' in the basement of a church. They fall in love, even though Hazel tries not to. She doesn't want to wound anybody else by dying, which she knows she will (as she can hardly breathe on her own because of her cancer). Gus is witty, charming, irreverent, and so smart. This poignant tale show the beauty of loving someone for who they are, not for how perfect they look or how long they'll live. The emotion was amazing, and the tragic tale of first love was heroic and touching. Great book."
5," knew of John Green from the Crash Course videos he hosts on YouTube.  I ventured around some more on the official channel, vlogbrothers, and discovered about his work as a novelist, specifically about this book.  I bought it on a whim.And I loved it.The Fault in Our Stars is one of the funniest, saddest, most emotional, and any other cliched adjective I could possibly think of, books I have ever enjoyed reading.  I went into this book blind to what the actual tale told.  I was clung to every page, ensnared in the world of Hazel, the 16 year old protagonist of the story.  I recommend this book to anyone with a fleeting interest in this novel."
5," bought this book because I've been a bi fan of John Green on Youtube for quite some time. due to massive amounts of talk about Hazel and Augustus and their relationship i was worried this would be a more love story for females. (me being male, decided that i'd give it a shot anyway) and all i can say is...worth it. Yes it is a love story, but it is SO MUCH MORE all rolled into one amazing story which i read faster than any other book I've ever read. and it is easily one of the best. worth the money, worth the time. if you're emotional, bring the tissues so not to stain the wonderful pages of this book with your TEARS (seriously, if you are emotional, you will cry.)"
5," bought this book a few hours ago. My plan was to read one chapter and then go to sleep. Needless to say, I read the whole book in one sitting.I was immediately drawn to every character in this book. Hazel is a tough but incredibly human protagonist. I fell in love with Augustus instantly. Even the more deplorable characters have their better moments.No other author I've come across can make me laugh like John Green can. No other author can make me cry like John Green can. And no author today makes me think quite like Green does.Whether Nerdfighter or someone who just randomly stumbled upon this book, TFIOS is well worth the read."
5,t  left me speach less it was just that amazing  I can't describe the love and pain hazel must feel.
5,"m a 15 year old girl who loves reading a lot and this book is one of the few books I have read that tought me a lesson. I, once again learned that I have to be thanful for what God has given to me. But that's the only lesson I learned, John Green tought me a lot of lessons in this book. But the most important one is that some infinities are bigger than others. I cannot think of any other way that anyone could have described this sentence to make it sound as beautiful as the one he has written. At the end of this book, I cried. I was full on bawling my eyes out. That's how good this book is. I promise you, unless you have a heart of stone, you will love this book."
2," This is John Green's best work yet. It has everything his fans have come to expect from him: great writing, lovable, witty characters, complicated lives, oodles of literary references, and a philosophical twist, all wrapped in a highly readable story about life and love and fate. I laughed, I cried, I tore through this book in a day, and I was sorry to see it end.I was a bit frustrated with the lack of development with the Peter Van Houten character, as something seemed rushed or missing there, but otherwise, this book was everything I needed from a young adult read. I am going to miss these characters, and I'll be waiting to read whatever John Green writes next."
5," saw a trailer for the movie that is coming out in August and wanted to see it and realized it was a book.  Well I bought the book and read it in less than a day.  I couldn't put it down.  I want my girls to read it. I cried and laughed through this entire book.  I think these kids are more grown up because of what they have been through.  A terminal disease will make a person older and even though they acted their age at times they do seem to be a little older.  That being said the book is as PG as it can get and anyone could read this.  I say read this book if you have not, you will not be disappointed.  I would really like to know what happens to Hazel though."
5," am a voracious reader. Just this summer I have devoured the Matched trilogy, all Rot and Ruin books up to this point, Cinder &amp; Scarlet, The first two of the Divergent series, Twisted, Hate List, and others I'm not remembering right now. This isn't to brag; it's to demonstrate how great The Fault in Our Stars is. Hands down it is the best stand-alone (not a series) young adult book I've read. It probably makes my top 10 of all time. I can't recommend this enough. If you love to read, this is original enough it will give you one of those reader's high. If you're typically not a reader, this book will win you over. Just get it already!"
5," Of all the books concerning death that I've read--and a strange WWII phase in middle school has left me with a plethora of tear stained memories to chose from--this one gave me that beautiful wink of hope and  an arguably satisfying end. I'd like to thank my friend Lyndie for recommending this book to me(I finally got around to it!). Your habit of choosing books with pretty covers reaped bountiful fruit this time around. I see why you so aggressively pushed this one. If you're a little weary from narratives that make you feel bad about being a person--thanks, F. Scott Fitzgerald--then you'll find this story refreshing. So thanks, John Green, you've wowed me again."
5," wouldn't call The Fault of Our Stars the saddest book ever. There are plenty of topics and things sadder and of greater moral weight than young love and cancer. There's systematic oppression, genocide, natural disasters. But what The Fault of Our Stars is, is the most well crafted book I've read thus far toward the end of inspiring a feeling of sadness. Fortunately for readers, this is not some purposeless tear jerking sadness, (although if you don't cry -a lot- while reading this novel, I suspect you are inhuman) but sadness which offers, at its core, a fantastic reward. Writing a review of this novel this fantastic (and this popular) seems redundant. Read it."
5," After seeing the previews for the movie version of this novel, I attempted to refrain from reading the book until after I saw the movie, but to just get a feel I decided to read the first couple pages. Bad decision for anyone like me that picks apart book-to-movie-adaptions. I could not put this book down after reading the first few pages. It is very well written and a pure joy to read, although the story isn't always a joyous one. It took me 2 days of sticking my nose in this book constantly because it is just that good that you do not want to put it down. I recommend this book a thousand times over, when you're done, read looking for Alaska by the same author."
5," am a 40 something mom who was looking for a break from my current addiction to Hunger Games-esque type books. In the last two years, almost ( except Game of Thrones) everything I've read has been in the young adult fiction genre....seems like this is where the real writing and storylines are these days... this is a quick read, beautifully written. I fell in love with all of the characters very quickly. I never give spoilers, and dislike reviews that give deep synopsis' ... with that said, if you are looking for a beautiful story with a realistic ending, this book is for you. Plan on shedding a few tears, laughing at times and being angry too...it's all here!"
5," Augustus and Hazel. Hazel and Augustus. I'll make this simple, I'm a twelve- year- old book snob, who feels next to no emotion for the characters, and just moves on to the next after reading a book. This is different. I cried with Mrs. And Mr. Waters, hated Monica with Isaac, laughed with Gus, cried with Hazel after the diagnosis. This is one of the best books I've ever read. If you don't like it, fine. You're allowed to have your wrong opinion. :) My friend has had cancer 2 times, and has a brain tumor right now. I know the pain Hazel's parents felt, because she is like a sister to me. I can relate to so many of the characters in so many ways. Read this book."
5," say alive because edgar allen poe is dead. but seriously, how does a 30ish man understand the world so well through a 16 year olds eyes? i LOVED THIS BOOK. i've read all his other books and loved them, but this one was incredibly deep. he understands things perfecting from Hazel's point of view (ex. he fought bravely against the cancer. Hazel- how else are you supposed to fight?)like everyone else here, i bawled my eyes out, but it was more than that. this book gave me incredible insight into the lives of those who live with cancer- and made me realize that cancer does not define a person, yet it is an indefinite part of who they are. i'm awestruck."
5," John green, I hate you. Mainly for two reasons:one, you killed me with this bookTwo, this book endedI have read this book countless times and it has torn me to pieces and reduced me to tears every time.Not only is the plot vastly richer than 81% coco dark chocolate, but also the style of writing is border line poetic. The characters are . Beautifully flawed and fitting to this literary masterpiece. I'd say that this novel is perfect, but perfection is an incorrect concept. I have read every novel John green has published and this is by far the best. I applaud your creativity and style. Thank you for this glorious work of literature"
2,t was really good and I couldn't stop reading it. It is a very sad book though and it made me cry.
5," Having seen some of the more negative reviews for this book, I find that they are generally off the mark. This absolutely does not tell a typical love story or cancer story. It is a book about teenagers with cancer but it is not about cancer. It is compelling and will make you feel very happy and very sad in a short amount of time. The main character is one that John Green creates masterfully that will have the reader emotionally invested in from the start.Quite simply, this is a book that needs to be read. It is written extremely well and it is very evident that a lot of time was put into it. If you read it, you will not regret it."
5," The Fault In Our Stars is an extravagant book that is read straight to the soul. It leaves you wondering how people really get through things like cancer. Hazel is an extraordinary character battling the life and death of cancer. She shows how difficult it is battling a sickness, and proves that you can get through anything with love. Augustus is a true mastermind at getting to know the best of someone's heart. Even though he left the world, he knew that he was not leaving anyone's soul. This novel was perhaps the best I've ever read and is sure to never leave your mind. I would like to thank John Green for taking the time to write this fantastic book."
5," saw this book a couple times as I walked past a bookstore in the airport. I didn't know what it was about or anything about it, however, the title sounded so familiar. I considered buying it numerous times but didn't actually do it. Finally decided to search it on Amazon. SO glad I did. I absolutely loved this book. It was perfect in every way. I loved the characters. They were amazing and fit so perfectly together. They were real and it was so easy to understand and come to love each one of them. I love the metaphors and the quotes from other authors. It was just wonderful. One of the best books I have ever read. Every person should read this book!"
5," Can you EVER possibly go wrong with John Green?! Absolutely, positively not! This was a beautiful, beautiful book. It was just incredible how he made up a fictional book so it was like reading two books at the same time (kind of LOL). But gosh, this book just gave me so many different emotions; page after page, I found myself either squealing or laughing or feeling the pain of the characters. Augustus and Hazel were so right for each other I just wanted to punch something because they were so perfect! T___T They just felt so real and it was so, so, so hard for me to let go after I finally finished the last page. Everything was perfect about this book!"
5," Often in capital L literature today, there are messages, life lessons. This book however comes with no singular lesson, but rather a series of beautiful and unforgettable phrases that haunt you. The words of this book have rocked me to my core and have helped me to change the way I see the beauty of the world and the beauty of people. Never in my life have I recommended a book more. If you are considering this book for the reading, I heartily suggest that you do. I want you to enjoy each page, and each moment that John Green has filled to the brim with emotion. This book has changed me, and I hope with all of my heart that you will let it change you."
5," The Fault in Our Stars is an amazing book! Quote-worthy, crush-worthy, and most of all-tear-worthy. I don't normally like sad books because they make me, well sad. This was an exception. It wasn't a dwell-on-it I-hate-the-world can't-stop-crying type of novel, it's just heart warming and heart breaking at the same time.  Read it-you'll know what I'm saying.John Green brings his characters to life and makes sure that they don't leave your mind. When the book was over, I couldn't decide what to think about it. It kind of just ended-but it strangely fits and makes it even better.I highly recommend to those who enjoy heart-warming YA romance."
5," absolutely love TFIOS i really cannot express how much i loved it. The story kept dragging me back in for more even now after I've read it i still want more. In a way i kind of feel like Hazel after she read her favorite book AIA but in a good way. Theirs no doubt in my mind i will forever reread and recommend this to others. Im not good at reviews this is actually my very first book review. I cannot rack my brain enough to find the right words to explain how incredibly awesome,funny,tear jerking just all around amazing this book is. So my dear fellow readers definitely buy this one and always DFTBA!And John I love love LOVE you for writing this."
5," definitely think this book is for a younger crowd, the thoughts are very much so of a child, and actions of a child. It brought me back to childhood thoughts.It was a sweet love story of two sick teenagers how they fall in love and how they use their wish from make a wish.. How she makes friends and breaks her tight leash with her parents who at first want her to venture the world, then realize she is and they become afraid. (Like any normal teen parent would)  she has a beautiful relationship with everyone she encounters. A sweet soul. And the love of her life became her new story, for herself at least. (And us readers)"
5," read this book after reading some of Greens other work.  I was most excited about this one, but I was reading them in release date order so I waited.  Even after all the hype I still thought that this book was one of the best books I ever read.  I found the writing style so easy to be absorbed into and the storyline was enchanting and I could not stop reading it.  I have now read this book around 5 times and each time, I find myself in tears when ever I reach certain moments of the book.  The book is heart breaking and unpredictable and is just an emotional rollercoaster that everyone should ride.  I would recommend this book to everyone I know."
2," Books and movies speak to me. I always try to find the detailed base of the story. I was able to find it easily in this book, but I won't say because it spoils. Cancer is one of my biggest fears. I'm scared for my dog, my family, and myself. I almost didn't read this, because I was afraid that it would say something about cancer that woud make me even more scared. After reading it, and pulling myself together fom the tears, I realized that this book isn't about cancer. It's about a girl's personal story, and the cancer is just a twist to he story.If you read this, I can promise you smiles, laughter, tears, and complete satosisfaction."
5, This is an amazing story and it proves that in life there is an ending no matter how long you really want to live. It shows that yet you are or can be sick that you have a life to live and that there are people that make your life worth living each day. It also shows that with one death the morale of some can change and that between few people a bond can form and only such people understand what's going on. We don't get to choose our life or what really happens to us but we do get to choose how it affects us and who we want to live it with. This book has a different perspective on life itself and the way people handle what they are going through.
5," ordered this book by mistake shortly after I got my first Kindle, yet I decided to read it, instead of turning it back to Amazon. The description of this book was not a book I would have ordered. The Fault in Our Stars was written, I believe, for a younger reader, possibly in their teens or even older. Yet, I now believe it is a book for young and old. What inspiration! It is about a teen age girl who has had terminal cancer for as long as she remembers, she has been, terminally ill. This book made me laugh, cry, and a heart feeling good. I highly recommend this book for people over 12 years old up to 112 years old.Marci L"
5," This is a talented author. I read books for young adults  because my librarianmentioned to me that they have more magic.  I read Looking for Alaska and was impressed with Mr. Green's use of language and the visual power in it's effect.  The capacity to create visuals usually sinks me into a book; I lose track of time; hate the pleasure to end.  The magic is in Green's wordcraft, certainly not the themes of life.  The stories are real.  Very real, with character construction that is genius full of emotional truth.  The stories hold suspense.  I would recommend The Fault in Our Stars  to anyone who loves to read, see, and cry..."
5," Markus Zusak was right in his review, The Fault in Our Stars is John Green at his best. You laugh, you cry, and then you come back for more. I finished this book within a day, unable to put the book down. I was emotionally attached and deeply moved. The book literally had me wiping away my tears in one scene and laughing the next.The book stays with you. After I finished reading, I sat there, stunned and just thinking for awhile, not quite capable of digesting it all yet quite ready to go back to the book and read again. This is a great book and quite easily the best young adult book I've ever read.I can't wait for John Green's next work."
5," This one I highly RECOMMEND, though, I did dread, not in a bad way, reading this book because I'm a hopeless romantic and I always want a happy ending with the fictional characters that I read about. =)) I stayed up and finished this book early this morning and it's A MUST READ!!John Green couldn't have come up with a more perfect title for Augustus and Hazel's story. It was very sad, but don't let that discourage you from reading it (it really is a good book), so sweet and beautifully written. Not to spoil anything, but have a box of tissue ready if you do decide to read it. I woke up with puffy eyes, but it was worth it. Happy Reading!"
5," What can I say about this book that hasn't been written? Gorgeous, sweet, heartbreaking, sensitive, fun, and completely and utterly wonderful are the first words that come to mind to be quite honest. I devoured this book on a Sunday afternoon complete with ugly snot crying in my bedroom before bed.  I fell in love with Hazel Grace and Augustus because of their hearts. Living with a deadly disease, Hazel could have fallen into a deep depression. She could have given up on life. As could Augustus to be honest, but they used the strength from one another to be strong. They were so strong, even in the face of death, sickness and heartache."
5,"ll keep this review relatively short, since there are SO many reviews on it already.I enjoyed this book a lot. I did the ugly cry more than once, so it gets pretty sad. I wouldn't say the entire book is a beautiful book, but there are parts of it that are beautifully written. I love reading a book and coming across a part that pulls at my heart and I think to myself how poetic, how beautiful!. There are not many books that I feel this way about, so it's a big deal to me for something to be beautiful.My favorite part of this book is how real it was. It was honest in the ugliest, most brutal way."
5," am 50 year old woman but I do read YA books on occasion and thought I would give this chance since I had gone through cancer with two immediate family members and the reviews were so great.  I read the book in 2 days and found it sweet and an easy read but I do not understand the love it seems to have inspired in so many people other than the fact that this author supposedly has a HUGE youtube and twitter following. Frankly, I liked a Walk to Remember better in regards to story topic.  Also, this book can not touch Catcher in the Rye with a ten foot pole in regards to cynical teenagers. Good read but no way worthy of all this gushing."
5,"n the English dictionary or any dictionary for that matter there absolutely no word to describe how this book made me feel and although anyone reading this review who hasn't read the book it must sound like I'm going over board here which admittedly I might, but it just that good . Any they only way you describe the book with catching every last thought feelings and new perspective is simplest put in the the once thought to be over used with no real meaning and defining aspect.  NO WORDS cause maybe the best WORDS to describe something is none at all.  Just the simple silence of the unspoken word of us all can truly describe this book."
2," This book was incredible. It took me all of five hours to read on a road trip. I did shed a few tears during the end, which is kind of rare for me. The characters felt so real-- it felt like I actually knew Hazel and Augustus and Isaac. It felt like I was right there with them ad everything was going on; at some points I had to use the dictionary function of the Kindle whilst reading this book. John Green definitely likes big words. It's a very deep, beautiful book though. The kind of book you want to tell people about, but at the same time, the kind of book that you want to be yours and yours alone. I definitely recommend buying this!"
5," This story was more than exceptional. It was over the top excellent and meet every emotion! There were times you wanted to cry, times to laugh, and times to be angry. You could feel the character's every emotion and could connect to her.Hazel is a bright, talented girl that creates the story. Without her there would be no story. She is the cherry on top.Augustus is the love of Hazel's life and the love of anyone who reads this book. You at first hate him but you learn to love his personality and character. He cares about as if she were his own daughter.This is the best book ever and deserves a five star rating."
5," had yet to read a book that was so sad as it was funny. The insight into a world I am not familiar with was well appreciated, the characters were developed beautifully, the story makes you realize that their are more serious topics in life then what most of us young adults consider. I laughed, I cried, but most of all I breathed (no pun intended) this story. I reveled in the simplicity that even when undergoing such tumultuous difficulties in life Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters mattered more for how they lived their lives then for how others constantly saw them dying. It was an amazing book that I believe everyone should read!!!"
5," The Fault in Our Stars was my favorite read of the summer. The writing, the plot, and the characters were all pure perfection. Yes, the topic of terminally ill teenagers is depressing, and yes, you will absolutely cry your freaking eyes out, but this is one of those stories that HAS to be read and will stay with you forever. Seriously, everything about this book is raw, real, and hauntingly beautiful. His writing literally takes my breath away! I loved the writing, story, and characters so hard that it's not even funny. I honestly have no words. All I can say that y'all have to read this book. It is beyond a 5 star read in my eyes."
5," My college-aged son recommended this book to me.  All I can say is it deeply affected me. The literary style in writing, the quotes and deep metaphorical meaning in the words...the beautiful relationship between Gus and hazel and the fact they were able to share intellect and love and small things through their short time together. Tears often would fall upon reading...I loved their dinner in Amsterdam and their union that they were able to share which all should be blessed to with one they love.  The unabashed enthusiasm of Gus and the way he saw things was wonderful.  A great read.  The fault in our stars is a book worth reading."
5, This book honestly takes my breath away somehow it is an amazing love story and at the same time a completely tragic one. John Green has created amazing characters that anyone would fall in love with. I want my own Augustus Waters (well minus the cancer) some people call him pretentious but I think he is amazing not to say he isn't kind of an idiot but if he wasn't he wouldn't be a believable teenage boy. Hazel is just so inspiring an amazing person who is dying but still cares about the others around her more than her own feelings. I'm not the type of person to reread any book but this book I will probably reread a thousand times.
5," borrowed this book from the library, along with three others.  Usually I start reading one book for about three chapters, put it aside , and start reading another.  I read about two chapters of The Fault in Our Stars a day for two days--on the third day I  realized that this is arguably the best book I've read  in the past couple of years, and I finished it in one stretch.I think that good writers tell a good story, but the memorable writers are those who tell a story in a memorable way. And John Green is a memorable, fantastic writer.  I bought the book as soon as I finished reading my library copy.  This one is a keeper!"
5," This is a great book. Every one else says that if you don't cry while reading this book you have a heart of stone, so I guess you could say that I have a heart of stone.  This a book abouttwo 'star crossed lovers' with cancer. When you come to the end of this book I guarantee that you will cry at the end of this book - unless your me.  I know exactly how stupid that sounds but this definitely is a book worth your time.I am 11 and I am very academic, and a story to me is just a story. I know it's not real.  I guess I don't cry while reading the sad books because I've never experienced anything like what happens in them."
5," The subject is a difficult one - terminally ill young cancer victims. Sounds like it would be depressing, and it might have been, if the principal characters in this story accepted their fates with resignation and self-pity.Having worked with teenagers, and some with debilitating and terminal diseases and conditions, I saw first-hand the kind of determination depicted in this novel - to fight against the diagnosis, to win little victories, to exasperate loving and desperate parents, and, ultimately, to live - and die -with some measure of independence.This is a powerful book, should be on all high school reading lists."
5, This was a great book.  I really can't comment a whole lot on the technical portions of how it was written but it is just one of those books that you get extremely entangled with the characters and their lives.  You don't really want the book to end because you feel like you've become attached to the lives of the characters and  you just don't want that relationship to end.This book gives you a view into a side of cancer and illness that I have personally really never thought of.  I thought that Green does a great job at sharing a new perspective even if it is one that many of us don't really want to see.Full Review: [...]
2," A compelling read.  I was sold on the characters from their first appearance.  The sadness of the story is sweetened with the humor and the personal quest of the characters to find some meaning to it all.  It certainly made me think about my life and my decisions.  I would love to think that many teens are reading this book because it looks at love and life with real heart.  I think it would also be a good idea to read the book before the movie comes out, because unless some genius can figure out how to look into the human soul and human consciousness and show it on film, the movie is going to come across as merely a tearjerker."
5," Honestly, the author pertained having fallen in love with someone who is quite extraordinary and fantastic on a number of levels quite wonderfully. The fault, is that The fault, my dear Brutis, is not in the stars, but in ourselves. Although writing this review is most likely pointless, because Writing does not resurrect, it buries. but, I shall write it anyway for the potential readers to tell them that it was quite possibly the best book I have read. It feels like I'm Hazel and this is AIA. Anyway, John Green, I thank you for having such an amazing way with words. Thank you for writing this, it was an epic story.-K"
5," This is one of the best books I have ever read (and I a HUGE Harry Potter Fan...). It took me a long time to just get over the fact that it was going to be sad and just read it. I honestly regret how long it took because it is that much longer that this book was not in my life. If you know someone who owns it and is willing to lend it to you, or if you're considering borrowing it from the library, that's great but I'm going to tell you right now, just buy it. You will want to read it over and over again. Augustus and Hazel are amazing characters and you will grow with them, learn with them, love with them, and mourn with them."
5," A sweet and poignant story about laughter, love, and loss. I know this is a YA novel, but I think this is one of those books that transcends age.  It tells the story of terminally ill teens in a way that gives them quiet strength.  It portrays them with power over what they have control over and the story is told in an engaging no nonsense way.  It is a quick read that stays with you long after you are done with the book, it is no surprise they are making a movie based on the book, I look forward to seeing it and plan on bringing lots of tissues.  A good book like this makes you count your blessings and appreciate every day."
5," This book is one of the most well-written books I have read that is directed toward my age group! I am (and have been for half of the book) in tears still. I, as Hazel did, fell in LOVE with Augustus Waters (or at least as much as you can LOVE a fictional character) just by reading how he was described. He was so perfect. And Hazel was so perfect for him.This book also helped me understand (at least somewhat) what young cancer patients go through all the time, and it made me realize how blessed I am not to have this disease.Thank you, John Green, for writing this book. It was a PRIVILEGE to be able to read this."
5," loved this book.  It was interesting to me because it gave me an inside look on what it would be like to live with cancer.  I liked the character Augustus Waters because he was really funny. I could not put the book down for too long.  I kept wanting to go back and read it every day.  Every chapter left you on a cliffhanger so it kept me interested to see what would happen next.  I can see why it was a best seller.  I also went to see the movie.  However, like the saying goes the book was better than the movie.  I am looking forward to reading another book by John Green.Isabelle LeBlanc (5th Grade)"
5," This is one of the best books I've read in a long time.  I have not had the pleasure of reading John Green before, but after reading in many different forums about the anticipation surrounding this release, I decided to give it a try.  I did not put down my Kindle by choice until this book was finished.  I cried, of course, but it wasn't unexpected and it wasn't the sort of depressing book where I want to hide in a dark room after reading (read: Jodi Picoult).  I recommend this book for any age group, don't let the young adult part of the description turn you off.  I'm looking forward to reading Mr. Green's earlier books."
5, To say the least I hate reading.. I read this book in 4 days. Obsession with reading would be the least thing that characterizes me. But this story just seems to trap you. You feel for these characters. My girlfriend survived cancer stage 2 Hodgkins Lymphoma and this Girl Hazel Grace Lancaster is her. I mostly enjoyed this book because I fell in love with this fictitious character because she resembled the actual love of my life so much. I legit cried in lime 2 parts of this book and thought I was suffering a mental breakdown I had to reevaluate myself thinking what man cries reading a story. But I loved it. A good read.
5," This book is amazing.  It shows that we should be grateful for what we have. Basically, it's about Hazel, a sixteen year old girl living with lung cancer.  She never wants to come out of the house she just watches tv and thinks about death.  Her mother makes her go to a Cancer Support Group where she meets Augustus, a seventeen year old guy with bone cancer they get to know each other and find out they both have their favorite books. Soon they want to meet the author of An Imperial Affliction who lives in Amsterdam.This is an absolutely amazing book with tons of twists and turns.  I recommend it to anyone 13+"
5," This book is terrible! I purchased it after reading all the positive reviews. I got halfway through the book when I decided that I couldn't read another page!! It's very pretentious. Teenagers do not talk this way and the plot where they go visit an author is ridiculous and takes away from the story line. One other thing that irritated me is I feel like the writer just needed some material to take up pages and make the story longer so he wrote about two of the characters playing video games, over, over, and over again. I don't even want to see the movie after reading this book. I wish I could get my time and money back!"
2," Just bought this book today, decided to start it while eating lunch at Whole Foods which then lasted 6 hours as I could not stop turning the pages. This is a serious must read that caused me to laugh and bawl (at the same time). I do not cry easily, however this really got to me. Unlike the many other books about death and dying that consist of cliches like living each day to the fullest and what not, this book was brutally honest. Will be reading this one again. Advice: read this book when alone, I had to endure many awkward Are you okay..? as I cried my eyes out while eating a cheesecake during the last 50 pages."
1,", probably like most people, have heard so many good words and reviews about this book. So, I ordered it. Let me just say, from the first couple of pages this book had me hooked. I'm not much of a big reader, but I couldn't put it down. I finished it in about 2 days, which is practically unheard of for me. I love how John Green writes, I think the style is perfect. I laughed with this book, I definatley cried, and I love it. I would probably consider it the best book I've ever read in my whole life. And as for the price, I've seen the same paperback copy in store for much more than the price it's for here. Five stars!"
5,"ve never been so moved by a novel.  I downloaded this book after hearing about it from friends on Facebook and seeing it on so many Best of 2012 lists.  I'm beginning to read more of John Green's novels after this amazing story.  I hope you fall in love with the characters like I have and that you are moved by their story like I was. I felt like a passenger along their journey, laughing with them and crying right beside them.  I can't recommend it to enough people.  This is even the first review I've been inspired to leave for a book I've read. Don't take my word for it, read it yourself. You won't be disappointed."
5," John Green's book - The Fault in our Stars -That's the thing about pain, it demainds to be felt. and My Thoughts are stars I can't fathom into constellations. Although this is poignantly about LIFE in capital letters from the viewpoint of a teenaged girl on the verge of womanhood....with terminal cancer.....it touches the very soul of humanity. Any of us who have come through ordeals - whether physical OR psychological - Know this always been terminal feel....But this book is breathtakingly about WHY we live! Perspectives and choices...BUT live, we do...and Life is about the EXPERIENCE..."
5," Certain authors make you feel like you are living life with them. John Green is one who does that for me. He sucks me in and I can't get enough. This is the reason for the 5 star review because it reminded me what it was like to be a kid but it reminded me too what it was like to be angry and hate the rain for falling.I know these teenagers seemed unrealistic but I imagine in the face of horrific disease and death, you would grow up a little faster than most. He paints the picture of what it means to give yourself over to another person and the severe letdown of having life get in the way of all our plans."
5," This has got to be one of my favorite books ever. I laughed, I cried, I smiled, and I finished it in a single day despite being incredibly busy because it was just that awesome. The complexities of Augustus made him one of my favorite character to ever grace the pages of any book. Hazel was a strong narrative voice that has stayed with me despite having read the book days ago.I couldn't stop thinking about it as I read; I was onstage in a musical Friday night, and my thoughts were on TFioS the entire time (thank God I had no lines). I most definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for something worth reading."
5," didnt know till after i had finished reading the book that this was meant for 'Young Adults'... I'm an 'old adult', who's normally too diffident to write reviews but this book moved me to tears and touched me deep inside. I think what i liked best about it was that all the characters were very true to life and people you could instantly relate to and empathise with. Hazel, Gus, their respective parents, even Isac...each one so sensitively and realistically portrayed. I would recommend this book highly to everyone but it would have to include a caveat- its desperately sad, so dont read it if you dont want to cry...."
5," John green is a genius with his books, this is my second time reading the fault in our stars. I am reading it for a project for school, i chose this book because its a touching love story about two teenagers falling in love with their cancer perks i recommend this for everyone to read. Not many books have made me cry but this one had me sobbing. IT IS NOT A SAPPY CLICHE TEENAGE LOVE STORY. It actually has emotion in this book. I also recommend looking for Alaska which is also by john green or the perk of being a wallflower by Stephen Chbosky. i hope you enjoy this book as much as i did."
5," The Fault in Our Stars is now the third John Green novel I have read, and it was utterly breathtaking. This is the first book that made me cry since the first grade, when that sort of thing was more or less socially acceptable. Reading the story of a group of very philosophical and very ill kids my age made me put my comparatively unimpressive problems into perspective, and I really think that reading The Fault in Our Stars gave me a new appreciation for life. At first I didn't think I would enjoy this book, as I normally don't read sad books, but in the end I enjoyed it immensely. I am so, so glad I read this book."
5," As a young woman who has survived cancer, I was actually hesitant to read this. But it is a beautiful work and I cried both happy and sad tears more than once. My favourite thing that Augustus says, that rings true about this thing called life- whether you have cancer,have survived it, or have never had it is this. You are going to live a good and long life, filled with great and terrible moments that you cannot even imagine yet!Because whether you have had cancer or not, that could be the most beautiful thing a 17 year old has ever said. We all want it to be true. This story makes it thus. So happy I read this."
2," BUY THE BOOK!I'm not a writer per se, therefore any review I give it cannot do it justice. I honestly have no words to describes this book's absolute brilliance. Short and to the point, this book is easily on of the single best written of all time, a modern-day Shakespeare of sorts. As I said, I am not the most creative of people when it comes to writing, but if anything look at the sheer numbers: 1 person who voted 1 star (ZERO of 19 people finding it helpful), 3 people rating it 3 stars with very little support shown from others, 6 people giving it 4 stars, not bad, and the a whopping 213 and counting 5 stars."
5," The Fault in Our Stars by John Green is a beautifully written novel about teenagers, falling in love, cancer and the meaning of life. This book is technically an adolescent novel. Its beauty and depth make it much more than that. The story, recounted elsewhere in these reviews, is basically about a pair of teenage cancer patients that fall in love. It is heart wrenching, sweet and funny. I work with teenagers every day, and to my ear Mr. Green gets their voice absolutely right. Keep the tissue near by for the last 50 pages. As John Irving once wrote We are all terminal cases. A Must Read!!!!"
5," This book is wonderful.  My daughter read it first.  It was recommended to us by my third grade daughter's teacher for my sixth grader to read.  My sixth grader loved the book so much that I read it.  I've recommended this book to everyone who will listen to me.  It is heartfelt, beautiful, real, sad and uplifting all at the same time.  I cried when Hazel was in the hospital for many reasons, I cried for the other characters challenges and losses but I also smiled at how human they all were and how they dealt with their lot in life.  Great story.  It also made me want to go to Amsterdam in the spring - read it."
5," was encouraged to read this book by a friend who swore I would love it.  She was right.  I loved the characters and the rich vocabulary she had.  I loved her family and the way they nurtured her spirit, vocabulary and dreams but still panicked about her leaving them.  I loved Augustus and his cockiness in the midst of all he had to deal with.  I loved the mystery behind the author and that he kept showing up.  I loved the ending.....For a book about kids with cancer, it isn't all that sad.  More uplifting and poignant.  I have recommended it to several people and each has loved it.  It's just that good."
5," As a 30something who has been a voracious reader since preadolescence, that's no small feat.  I love John Green, but his work has not blown me away until now.  This book is far superior to his others in terms of complexity, poignancy, and emotional impact.  Usually I love books and they are good while they last, and I move on quickly and rarely look back.  This is the first book since The Hobbit that I want to read over and over again.  I don't mark books but I felt the urge to highlight because some of his lines were so unbelievably well-written.  I would recommend this book to anyone, any age.  SO good. DFTBA"
5," The book is good. I seen the previews for the movie, but it is a little bit difference than the book. It has a sad part in the middle. There are some strong and bad language in the book so I recommend the book for people 12 and older unless you let your kids. It is a really good book. The part when they meet a author it unravels a secret and some anger through the part. Not trying to spoil it, but reading the book really grabs you and makes you want to keep reading it. Got it twos days ago and finished in two days and a half it is that good. Enjoy. Never repeat some of the language and always try to be polite."
5," This book was unlike anything I've ever read but in a good way. Recently I lost my grandmother but it was to old age. she left her mark on her family. I learned how to be kind, funny, humble, and live like there's no tomorrow. I never questioned what she said when it was out of love. This book shows how real somethings can be. I personally haven't really been effected by cancer but I know of many people who have and this shows many aspects of how it can effect you. I give this book for stars because I too wish k knew what happened to hazel Grace!  However I wasn't surprised in the last to see out end that way."
5," This book is the story about a young woman and fellow cancer victims and their families facing the challenges and fears living with cancer brings. I read a review on Medscape where several doctors questioned the validity of the second episode of cancer of the eye that resulted in one of the characters blindness. I was angered by that cold, clinical, medical critique because it missed what this book was all about (and something professional caregivers should be concerned about) ... LIVING with cancer, and the feelings cancer victims and their families have to deal with as they dance the cancer dance together."
4," The Fault in our Stars - I'm an adult and didn't want to read this. Not because it was geared to teens, but because of the contact. I hate to get depressed by a book. While this story certainly is sad, it is also up-lifting. I was immediately drawn to Hazel Grace, much wiser than her sixteen years, and understood her reasons for holding herself at a distance. Why connect with someone when you'll be leaving them soon. But Augustus brings her into his world and teaches her to live the life she has left. Yes I cried, but I'm not depressed. I loved John Green's writing and his ability to reach my soul."
5," This book is about living much more than it is about dying.  It's about seeing the finality of life without having finality IN your life.  It's heartwarming and honest, and real.  However, I don't see this as a teen book simply because the characters are teens.  Firstly, they speak like 60 year old literary historians.  As in someone's review -- their conversations are not believable of a 16 and 17 year old.  However, seeing as they are sick, you can picture them as old souls and highly and quickly evolved immature human brains.  It's a quick read with bigger words than any teen book I've ever seen.  Enjoy!"
2," From the moment the book started to the very end, I loved the characters. The detail was just the right amount to join in their triumphs and sob for their setbacks. I could see the heart of Jesus, feel the cool breezes while touring the sights of Amsterdam, smell the liquor on a certain character's breath and hear the wheezing of Hazel's lungs each time she struggled to take a breath. Thank you for bringing these characters to life and sharing them with us.Oh, and I would HIGHLY recommend the audio version...it is one of the few times I believe the story was enhanced by listening vs. reading."
5," John Green is such an amazing writer. To describe the pain someone feels from sadness but also from illness makes me think he's felt the pain from both. To know pain is to have felt it before, just as to know love is to have felt love before.The amazing part is you are so caught up in the story that you don't realize that it's not Hazel Grace that is going to die from the cancer, it's Gus, the one who's been in remission for 14 months. You never think that his cancer will come back, let alone come back ten-fold.Such an amazing story! Definitely one to share and encourage anyone to read!"
5," Usually I never pick a book with a cancer survivor storyline. Usually they are depressing and hit a bit too close to home. This book however has dealt with the subject sensitively yet without overly dramatizing it. John Green has treated cancer survivors as regular human beings who want to be recognized and treated as such. Very well written and though targeted at the YA, will be enjoyed by all! Its a simple story where the relationship between two teenagers plays the pivotal role and the disease the second lead which makes it as realistic as could be. Go ahead and pick it up. You won't regret this one!"
5," Be prepared to get sucked into this book immediately by its clever dialog and sophisticated humor. The young adult characters are intelligent, witty, thoughtful, and admirable. Although the main characters are teens with cancer, you will enjoy getting to know them, watching their relationships deepen, and learning from the ways they deal with illness and the possibility of death. And at the core of this book is a wonderful love story, full of optimism, loyalty, and deep human connection. There are some deeply sad moments but the ending leaves you with a surprising appreciation of life, love, and family."
4," love reading books, and when I came across this, I will honestly say that it wasn't that appealing. My friend recommend it to me and I decided to read it. Best decision I've ever made. I absolutely loved this book and I will admit that I did cry.I don't think I can ever read a book again and like it because I'll keep comparing TFIOS to it.SPOILER ALERT****I gave it 4 stars because of the ending, most of the story is about hazel looking for an ending to AIA and never getting one. But Green just ends th  book not telling us what happens to hazel??!! But I still love this book&lt;3"
4," Although I am retired from teaching I would like the opportunity to recommend this book to mature young readers. The subject of chronic and terminal illness in young people is approached and handily covered in a straightforward, realistic, yet heartfelt bedside manner. The characters try their best to live like other teens and their conversational banter reveals this desire yet the kids who are sick and have been for a long time in their short lives have a tentative grit to carry on for those who love them, and for themselves. I am glad I have it handy on my Kindle. I might read it again!"
4," Whether you have had someone die in your family from cancer or seen someone suffer from the terrible disease is not relevant at all as to how you will feel about this book. Sure, you will see the suffering but it won't envelope the book.If you can learn one thing from this entire book, please let it be the fact that we are ALL living with a terminal disease. Let's face it. One day each of us will die. Being able to swallow this truth will let you live a richer live and help you realize that what we truly want is a geniune human relationship. Hazel and Augustus have got that nailed down."
5," put off reading this because I have family members battling cancer and I didn't want to read a book about cancer, death, cancer, depression, cancer, dying from cancer, despair, cancer... you get the picture. I'm so glad I finally read the book because I couldn't have been more wrong. Yes, the characters have cancer but the book is not about Cancer and depression. It's about living and laughing and loving despite having a terminal illness. Yes, I cried, but I also I laughed out loud. John Green really knows the minds of teens. I throughly enjoyed reading this book and so did my teenage daughters."
5," 1. Plagiarizes bits from David Foster Wallace.2. Gets extremely basic facts about set theory wrong.3. Claims some element of truth that generic stories do not have, while providing none.4. Overflows with disconnected, high-school literary references that contribute nothing to the plot or ideas communicated (outside of creating a veil of literary quality surrounding the work).5. Contains only one-dimensional characters (most of whom aren't even likable).The best thing about this book? That it isn't the movie. THE MOVIE IS ATROCIOUS."
5," This story is brilliant, witty, insightful and heart-wrenching all at the same time. I really did laugh out loud and cry my guts out. I fell in love with the characters and all the different threads of the story were meticulously woven together into a whole - it's perfection, really. And it was hopeful without resorting to cliche - actually, while laughing in the face of cliche. The only readers who I can see not liking this are those who strongly dislike philosophy. Elements of it reminded me a little bit of the book 'Sophie's World'.... but it was much, much more enjoyable overall. A must read!"
2," am a pretty huge Nerdfighter and John Green fan so I pre-ordered this book. I had no idea what it was about when I pre-ordered it, I just trusted because it was from John Green that it would be good....and I was right! This book certainly had some sad moments and certainly had some funny ones, but there were a lot of very quoteable and moving parts to this book too. I actually picked it up and took it with me to read while my dad was in the hospital having a surgery to remove his cancer. Call it perfect timing! If you are a fan of John Green or just want some good reading I'd suggest this book."
5," This is one of those books that stays with you. I finished this book on sunday and now its thurday and im still thinking hard about it. I have never read a book that made me cry the way this book did either. Its like the characters live inside you as you are reading it and you really feel everything that they are feeling and i could honestly go on about it forever, its just so rediculusly good. If you are thinking about whether or not you should read this book i promise that you should. I am just a regular senior girl in high school and I think it this book made me understand a lot about myself."
4," So here I am, nearly a year after I received a kindle fire for my birthday, (and at least 150 read books later) and I am writing my very first review! I have read TONS of books that I have just loved but this book has moved me to my core. I would fail not only you as the possible reader, but the author as well, if I were to try and sum up this book. I failed miserably trying to recall it to my husband before just huffing and puffing and giving up. It has been two days since I have finished and my thoughts are still consumed with this story. So here is my review... READ IT! You will not be sorry!"
5," This book is so amazing and unusual from other books I have read. It makes you think about life more than ever before and to thank God everyday for what you have. It is tragic but makes me smile from the inside out at the same time. This book is defiantly worth your time. My family has experienced many deaths from cancer so I can relate some to how the characters felt, but then again I cant relate at all because i've never been this sick before. This book shows me how horrible cancer is and how hard cancer patients have to fight just to stay alive. Something most of us take for granted in life."
5," This book has to be one of the most influential and special novels that I have read in a long, long time. Augustus and Hazel's love for one another felt true and definitely tried, despite the obstacles that kept getting in their way. I can't tell you how many times I have bought this book, only because I'd lend it out to a friend and insist that they keep it!If you are looking for a beautiful, contemporary love story that is on par with Titanic, then pick this book up! But get your own, 'cause I'm out of copies!  - Cameron Scott Day,  author of The Bad Thing About Us."
5," *spoliers*This book was truly amazing. I actually started reading this when my friend started so we read it together. Whenever we talk to eachother now,we always say okay or its a metaphor we always talk about this book now.I don't cry easily,but this book made me cry... a lot. It felt so real and I wished there love was forever.but I have to say, I like the not-so-happy ending of the book. I think it makes the book seem more like a reality.Overall this book was amazing. I dint regret buying this for a second. I never wanted to it down as soon as I started it."
5,"f you are the parent of a teenager, go into their room and borrow this book now!  Sit down, open the book and enjoy!  It's too bad that a writer like a magnificent writer like John Green doesn't get noticed by people other than young adults.  He is an artist!  His writting is so real so down to earth.  He has the uncanny ability to write from the point of view of a sick teenage girl!  Yet he doesn't make her silly or stupid.  He treats his characters and readers with respect and with love!  I am a new fan and a forever fan.  I will be borrowing all of his other books from my daughter now too."

5," You need to read this book. It's not only inspiring but it's also in a perspective that I've never even gotten a chance to even think about before, therefor it gave me an opportunity to see lives from others point of view even though this amazing book is fictional. Coming from me, an 8th grader that has a problem with reading, this book gave me hope. Hope to become a better reader, hope to read more books in general, or maybe even just to have connection with the concept of reading. So please read this book and if you don't then you will have no idea on the real concept of what reading is."
5," Actually, my daughter ordered this book.  She said it was really good and I should read it.  She was right.  Although classified as a young adult read, it would appeal to a broad age range.The book is about (primarily) 3 teens, all around 18, who have cancer.  It really gives one some insight into how someone with cancer, regardless of stage, deals with it, their thought process and how it impacts not only them but their families and others around them. It's not all rosey but it's not particularly depressing either. It would be a good assigned reading for a class."
2," Much like his other works of literary art, I was eagerly enticed from the start. John Green has a perfect way of balancing the need to capture your interest, and keeping it as the plot thickens and you're sent into a maze of spiraling emotions. I feel connected to these characters; as if John documented a year in their lives and then wrote about it. I'd love to see these characters brought to life, but at the same time I don't want to see this seamlessly perfect book fall victim to bad screenplay. Maybe John can direct a movie for it himself. Keep on doing what you do best, kind sir. Okay."
5," guess I fathom myself a writer -- it's something that makes my own personal world go round. In all honesty, too many people consider themselves writers, thinking they are spectacular or new. Again, in reality they are not. They are fantastically unspectacular and heinously unoriginal. So when a book comes along that defies these things, it leaves an impression. You do not merely read, but feel the characters, growing beside them and living their lives. And when it ends a small part inside you ends with it. Yet y o u are better off for it. This book is one of those novels. It is flawless."
5," loved this book, though it made me cry and I had to put it down at times. I don't know if the author had someone very close die of cancer or not but if he didn't he seemed to capture the thought process of a young lady going through a terminal illness well. Some things those of us who are healthy might never think about since we are, well, healthy. An added bonus was finding out in the reading that this story as  based in Indianapolis, Indiana which is my home town as well a  the authors. I recommend this book to anyone, especially if you've lost a loved one, close friend etc to cancer."
5," This book is heart wrenching and will steal you're heart. As you go along the journey with Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters through their nice ride on the roller coaster that only goes up you will see their differences understand their suffering and see what true love really is. It's not about quantity, it's the quality of the time and memories they have together. Reading this book killed me slowly and flipped my heart as if it was only a quarter; but I don't regret it a single bit. The Fault in our Stars gave me a different perspective on life and death which I will carry with me forever."
5," The Fault in our Stars takes you into the life two teens who have had to face more in their 16 years than most grown adults. While reading this book I grew strongly attached to the characters and felt like the loss of one was the loss of my own friend/family member. I found myself laughing, and sobbing, as I read the book, and when I was finished reading left with the worst book hangover ever. I'm still not sure if I will read a book as good as this one. I have read Alaska and paper towns but The Fault in our Stars is by far the best of John Green.P.s I am emotionally stable"
5," learned about Fault of Our Stars when my daughter's friend posted on FB that the main character reminded him of Christina. Intrigued, I read the book. I discovered a fresh, down to earth portrayal of a 16-year-old cancer patient's observations and reflections about her experience.This is a beautifully written book: funny, poignant, and insightful. It did remind me of things Christina would have said.For those of you that think, this kind of thing doesn't really happen in real life. I was one of you before my daughter died. And truly, things like this do happen."
5," This book is heart wrenchingly beautiful. If you know anything about John Green as an author or as a person (via vlogbrothers and such) you can pretty much assume that this book is going to make you laugh and cry all at the same time. It does not disappoint. John has a way of making his characters feel like your best friend in a way that everybody who reads his book can relate to. I highly recommend this book to people of all ages from all backgrounds. However, I don't recommend reading it in a public place as it will literally have you laughing out loud and crying within pages. DFTBA."
5," Cancer, death and teenagers. I gotta say that I would never have read this book if these three words were listed in the book description's first line. But, I decided to read the first page of the book which turned into the first chapter and, before I knew it, I had downloaded the book to my Kindle and was devouring the entire thing. The writing style is sometimes sarcastic and witty, but very poignant and I was sucked into the character's world and life. Many tears were shed while reading this book, but it is a must-read. In fact, I'm going to read some other books by John Green soon."
5," John Green's latest book tackles hugely ambitious themes in a beautiful and touching way. the characters are all unique and intelligent, along with being very real and touching. The story is heartfelt and honest, both funny and sad, and the language is wonderfully thought provoking. Possibly the saddest part is when you finish and realize you  might have trouble finding a book that live up to this one. Don't hesitate to make this purchase; it is money well spent.If you are interested in this book you maybe a nerdfighter. Do not panic, this is a good thing. Go to: [...] to lean more."
5," have been hearing amazing things about this book since it came out,but finally got around to starting it yesterday afternoon. I basically couldn't put it down thereafter until I read the last page.I consider myself somewhat of a hard target for touching material, having lost my father when I was Hazel's age to leukemia, but John Green really hit home with the end of this book. I don't like spoiler reviews, so I won't spoil this one, but suffice it to say he knows what he is talking about on the subjects of grief and loss, and I appreciate it deeply. Thank you, Mr.Green."
2," What a wonderful story about such a sad and poignant situation. I had been thinking of reading this book for a few weeks after reading one of John Green's other books and enjoying it. I cried - and I defy anyone reading this book not to finish it without a tear and a sigh. The characters, and I mean all of them (even van houten), were written smartly with the fine detail necessary to impart the soulfulness of the experience they were living with. I recommend this book to everyone no matter your age or gender and I believe you will walk away the better for the reading .....okay? Okay!"
5," absolutely loved this book. When I originally started reading it, I thought it was going to be like any other book about kids with cancer. How I was wrong. This book shows all the ugly sides of life and, somehow, shows all the beauty within all the ugly. Definitely recommend it; it was worth my money.The only thing I am deeply disappointed with is, that the movie is starting production, and it was released that the director will be Wyck Godfrey, aka, the director of Twilight. I probably will not be seeing the movie. Actually, I refuse to watch the movie at all costs."
5," Worth every penny. The first book I read was looking for Alaska and after finishing that, I started this book. It was so wonderful. For those of you who liked looking for Alaska this is the perfect book. John green  is a wonderful writer who does it again with this book. I cried and I laughed and I loved every page because you don't want this book to end. It was very well written and described. I can't wait for the movie this June . The story draws you in on page one and makes you want to read the whole book in one day without ever setting it down. Wow. My Favorite book hands down."
5," While the book falls into the Young Adult genre, the intellectual complexity of the novel really surprised me. John Green is not a man who writes lightly. There's nothing I love more than being completely surprised by a story. References to Kierkegaard, T.S. Eliot and William Carlos Williams elevates this epic cancer romance. An epic cancer romance sounds just how it feels while reading it. And if you should endeavor to take this story on then you should know that it possesses the capacity to make you laugh and cry within a three page spread. Read the rest of my review here: [...]"
5," First off, let me just say that this book is the best book you'll ever read. That's plain, simple fact. The characters are brilliant, the plot is superb and it will take you on an emotional rollercoaster like you've never been on.You'll laugh, you'll sigh, you might possibly flail and you'll (almost) definitely cry. So hop on, boys and girls, ladies and gentlemen, and read The Fault in Our Stars!(Side note: I didn't cry. I am starting to worry that I may be some sort of robot or otherwise emotionless creature, because that's the only way I couldn't have cried...)"
5," Of course, reading a book that's guaranteed to be heartbreaking doesn't make all that much sense...but sometimes it's refreshing. This one certainly falls into that! It's easy to become attached to these characters and by the end you feel like the type of casualty referred to within its pages. I don't know how many times I had to stop, take a few deep breaths and wipe away the accumulation of tears that made it impossible to read. I think the most important quality in a book is the author's ability to draw emotions out of you and I will certainly be reading more from John Green!"
5," By far one of the best books I have ever read!! I completely understand why this book is getting such rave reviews. One minute I was laughing and the next, bawling my eyes out. This is one of those stories that completely entrances you and you just get lost in the pages. It was a quick read, mostly because I could not force myself to put it down. The beautiful love story the author creates between Hazel and Gus is unlike any other I have ever read about. Just every little detail in this book was beautifully done and I so wish this book had not ended. It is a must must must read!!!"
5," am the type of reader who will usually only fill my plate with happy endings and positivity. This is one of the only books that I felt truly brilliant in its heart wrenching honesty. I read a few words and was hooked. I can not put into words how it touched me and changed me, but would highly recommend it. I think it takes bravery to read this. I know for myself once I began, I could not stop myself from pressing onward. It reminds me of how you feel after a pent up really emotional hard cry, afterwards the release feels good in the exhaustion, but it was painful getting there."
5," After I read another clever, star themed novel, <a class=a-link-normal href=/My-Life-on-Craigslist-Finalist-of-USA-Book-Awards/dp/1460985826>My Life on Craigslist: Finalist of USA Book Awards</a> - which I really loved and I highly recommend - I picked up this book because it was shown that customers who read My Life on Craigslist, also read this. I am not a YA fan and I shy away from books with too many reviews, but I am glad I picked it up. I think anybody who is like me and who likes books that really make you think about life, death, love, and our place under the stars would enjoy this book. Great read! Can't wait to read another book by this author."
5," So I'm a 33-year old, non-fan of YA novels (typically).  But I finally gave in and read this due to the hype, the movie release and at the advice of some close friends. While typical and expected in so many senses, this book delivers some of the most powerful perspective on dying, the real moments and experiences that make up our lives and the complexity of both love, friendship and parenting. I'm hooked. And oh so moved. Loved this book.  Loved the love story. Love the real, brutal pain -- cause that happens in the real world. I highly recommend this book to anyone &amp; everyone."
2," usually don't give rating, but this book is something special.I choose to hive it 5 stars because it touched something inside, and made me realize how undeniably ungrateful we are. Hazel Grace is an amazing character, she reminds me of what people would refer as  The New Woman in the Victorian era. I wish she had a fresh start, John Green is truly a mastermind in the putting of this novel. Partly I felt a connection with the characters, like I'd implantable my whole life. I really do recommend this book, take it from a 15yr old it will change your perspective in life."
5," can only join the other 5 star reviews. The book made me laugh, cry and suffer. The guys accept death and live with it, even joke about it. I have no experience with terminal cancer ill people and I would like to imagine, that some of them could take it like the young ones in the book as also their parents. Seems too good to be true , but who knows. Why Van Houten appeared at Augustus' funeral though remains an enigma to me, but maybe it was to give Hazel another chance to tell him off.I read this book in one night and am now off to find another one of John Green, c u."
5, This book grabs you by your heart strings and drags you into an intense love story of two young adults whose cancer stricken bodies are their own worst enemies. With a dramatic twist of events you find that your heart is caught between loving the book and wishing that someone would take a dagger to your now shattered heart and end the misery. John Green not only brings to life the struggles of love and illness but proves to us all that some books bring you to an entirely different world and while it is heartbreaking you would rather stay there forever then move an inch away!
5," This book is beautiful in a sad way. Everyone lives to die. I get that, but why... I don't want to spoil anything for people but you will ask why when you get further into the book... John Green is an amazing author and this book really did make me cry at the end. It made me think I should start YOLO-ing everything because you never know. You never know what's coming tomorrow or in the next hour. This was a very difficult book to finish (not for the vocabulary but for the fear of the main character's fate). This story was sad and beautiful. It is a great love story. Okay?"
5," absolutely love John Green's books, and this one was no different. My favorite of them all. This book, of course, was highly anticipated and when I started reading, I definitely wasn't disappointed. I never stopped reading from the moment I opened the book, so it was done in a just a few hours.This book shows two teenagers struggling with illnesses, dealing with normal teenage situations and friendships, travel, and love. I am not a crier at books or movies, so this did not make me cry, but the majority of people will tell you that tears will fall.Definitely a winner!"
5," Sometimes you read a sad book and it makes you sadder. And sometimes, you read a sad book and it makes you believe in the power of infinite love and makes you feel a little less sorry for yourself.  I was wallowing in one of those woe is me moments when I downloaded this book.  A book that I thought I had read but hadn't.  To say it moved me can only be an understatement.  The book is not about death, it is about life and accepting the fate and destiny we are given, as s***ty as it can sometimes be, because even in those desolate moments, there is the brightness of stars."
5, love the love story unlike most love stories you can relate in some ways now I'm not saying I'm sick like they are but yet I do feel the love they have for each other and it's just simply beautiful the book took me through many turns and several cliff hangers some good and some bad it is a happy heartwarming yet heartbreaking story that will forever be my favorite book I will never forget my favorite quotes they use and will probably read the book several more times and also share and annoy my friends and family with the book thank you john green for your amazing story
5," There's no other way I would describe this book. I bought it and it took me a while to read it. It took me some time to get into  it but once I learned about the characters and their problems I was hooked. I read 60% of this book in 5 hours at work. I cried  I laughed I said as out loud. there were parts in this book when it reminded,me of my family or life. Probably one of my favorite books. I will read this again and again.,It really touched me. The details in this book make you really understand what it going on and you feel like your with the characters!,work of art"
5," This is the second book by John Green that I have ever read, and he just gets better and better. A reader can tell from a simple summary of this book that it contains an emotional story. Two young adults meet at a support group for kids with cancer. Of course, the story is emotional, but it does not rely only on sadness for its strength. The characters have depth. They are interesting. They are troubled. They are trying to make meaning out of life, and they do not accept easy answers even when easy answers are in front of them. I liked it. Read it. You will like it too."
5," This book was a real eye opener and helped me see the never-ending struggle that some people are forced to endure in this world. I recommend this book if you're struggling right now. I don't know whether or not this book will help you in terms of coping with struggles or if it will open your eyes to really step into someone else's shoes as it did me. Nevertheless, this was a well-written and, I believe to be, inspirational book. The main character is utterly wonderful and I instantaneously related to her as a person of quick wit and a realist approached outlook on life."
2," This book is John Green at his finest, you'll laugh, and cry, and feel everything in between. A delicate story which doesn't shy away from the truly awful disease it portrays. Hazel, our dear narrator meets Augustus Waters in a support group for teens with cancer. Hazel has temporarily static cancer of the lungs, and Augustus had bone cancer, which abated once he lost his leg. Together they confront fears of oblivion, the concept of martyrdom, and what constitutes true heroism. If you are not looking for a book that is pressed full of emotional charge, search elsewhere."
4," Sometimes I find that because I have read so many books its harder and harder to actually feel anything when Im reading something new, because I expect more. This book was my more. It's one of the most beautiful novels I have ever read. It didn't give me everything that I wanted, but it left me with such a great feeling about life, love and the world around me that I feel I've changed as a person just by reading it. The love story between Hazel and Gus is timeless in my eyes, and I thought John Greene did such an amazing job of bringing these two people to life. Bravo."
5," A highly recommended glimpse into the the bodies, hearts &amp; minds of teenagers with terminal cancer.  I laughed out loud and sobbed shamelessly while remembering how falling into my first love felt and trying to forget the pain of losing someone I  love.  The storyline is clever, the characters are fully available and true, written for both teens and adults. Grateful that I was given an opportunity to meet Hazel and Gus and vicariously  experience meaningful moments through them.Thank you, John Green, for making me feel more alive than I have felt in years."
5," Oh God. I finished this around midnight, after cracking up, crying, cracking up some more, and then completely bursting into tears. I'm really not sure how to describe this. What I liked was that the book felt... different. It's unlike every book I've ever read. I felt like the writing style kept changing, but I liked it. I really, really liked Isaac. The book would not have been the same without him. He could make me sob and laugh at the same time. I want to say more, but it's quite late, and I'm tired. Just read the godda~~ book, it'll cleanse your soul or whatever."
5," As John Green said himself, this book makes you feel all of the things.The Fault in Our Stars (TFiOS) is brilliantly written and is not your average teen novel. The words flow perfectly and the ideas and concepts are beautiful and thought-provoking.Filled with love, heartbreak, laughter, sadness, hopelessness, and hope, TFiOS sucks you into the lives of some of the most amazing characters you will ever read.This truly is an amazing book, and I strongly encourage you to read it (with a box of tissues of course!). Best wishes! (And don't forget to be awesome.)"
5," Doubt is the clay out of which faith is made...we do not inherit it. The illusions of childhood and the societal teachings must be examined on the journey of life or the life unexamined is not worth living. I see John examining his journey in this book and being honest with his dis-illusionment of earlier idealism. As a retired pediatrician and psychiatrist, I appreciate John's character development. Helping people experience outcasts (cancer patients frequently are) as human beings and normal human beings appreciating them is a difficult feat....John did that!"
5," do not cry during books. Or at least I had not until I picked up this book. I've followed John and Hank for the past year or so, and in this time, I had not picked up one of John's novels. I generally do not like young adult fiction, but because I felt I was not giving John a chance, I ordered this book and gave it a shot.I have just finished this book. I literally could not put it down to stop reading it.I laughed, I cried, and I think all I've got to say is that I wish that there were more girls out there looking for an Augustus Waters than an Edward Cullen."
5," Just can't say enough about this book! Excellent narrative style. Terrific plot. It's about kids with terminal cancer and yet it's funny and sarcastic and realistic. It's also brutally sad, but without once trying too hard to wring tears from the reader. I have been a high school English teacher for 20 years, and this is one of the few books I have ever read that gets teenagers' voices exactly right. I would highly recommend this to pretty much anyone, but especially to young adults. It was such an impressive read, I will be teaching this to my students this year."
5, LOVED this story. I laughed out loud and completely lost it crying. It's so rare that a book has such balance and consumes your heart. The story was beautifully written and I couldn't help but to fall in love with the characters. I found several quotes throughout the book that grabbed me and wouldn't let me go.Notable quotes (there are so many in this book)That's the thing about pain...it demands to be felt.You don't get to choose if you get hurt in this world...but you do have some say in who hurts you. I like my choices.
5," This was our book club's selection and it is a beautiful book, but I have to say that it broke my heart. I know it's the ultimate compliment to a writer to have people emotionally invested in their work and this was totally true of this book. It's totally worth reading of course, just be prepared.My suggestion is to have a book that will make you laugh waiting in the wings (Where'd You Go Bernadette or Sex &amp; Suburban Lunacy or Bossy Pants), because Fault in Our Stars made me so sad by the finish, I really needed a sure dose of humour after that."
2," This is such a great book on so many levels. Hazel Grace, a teenager, is dying of cancer and falls in love with Augustus Waters, another teen also dying of cancer. As they fight cancer, they are grasping for their purpose in this world and the mark they will leave on it before they die. Although their perspective is through the eyes of young adults, it rings true for all if us. Green created such amazing characters that are intelligent, witty, and poignant. I loved this book for it's honesty and true depiction of life and death and the possible meaning of it all."
5, My inaugural John Green novel and I'm hooked. Never fallen so hard in love since Eric Segal's Love Story or since Rose &amp; Jack in Titanic the movie. You're left wishing you never read it because you're zoned out for days replaying the book in your head and life's never quite the same ever again.  As surely as art imitates life--I'm compelled to write to John Green to demand a sequel and fill in the blanks. What happens to Hazel? Does she die too? What about Issac? Did Monica return? Did An Imperial Affliction ever get its deserved re-telling to finish the tale?
5," thought I was going to have a really hard time reading this because I had heard it was sad. I'm not usually someone who likes and can handle sad books.This story is written in such a way that the sadness made me want to continue reading that much more. I found myself smiling, laughing and crying all within the same stretch of reading. I could not put this book down and once I got to the ending, I felt satisfied.I don't like to give stories away, so I will just say to read it and read through the sad moments. This book will leave it's mark on you."
5," This is only one of the hundreds of books I ever read, and reading this, this book pulls you in, immersing you into the story. It makes you feel what the characters feel. It is one of the few books I have ever read which made me have feelings while reading, and frankly, this is probably one of the best books I have ever read, and possibly the best book I will ever read. I recommend this book to people who are not emotionally fragile, for this book gave me one of the strongest feelings I have ever had. Joy, excitement, sadness, anger and more. Hope this helps."
5," This is such a good book, full of engaging conversations and the real problems of teenagers battling cancer. Hazel's terminal diagnosis is kept at bay with an experimental drug. Augustine is in the survivor category, and he brings love and laughter Hazel never thought she'd find. Their devotion to Hazel's favorite book leads them on a trip to the Netherlands to meet the author. While the ending may appear to be determined by the beginning, the book has a poignant and unexpected ending. This is a book I'll read over and over to enjoy every moment of it again."
5," Pain demands to be felt. That line drew me into this book, and along with the excellent ratings and critical acclaim, I ordered the hardback version of this book. I almost never buy new copies of fiction books, as I don't consider them in my budget as I will likely just read them once. I'm not sorry that I invested the money in this one.I'm an adult and loved it. If you're an adult and on the fence about this book, read it. It's wonderful. Great characters, story lines and writing. So many quote-worthy lines too! I doubt you'll be disappointed."
5," John Green got these characters just right. I was hooked in two pages. Loved the recurring line about side effects. Perfect!I worked with children with cancer for eighteen years. I found the teenagers to be full of hope, but with an irreverent sense of humor and a realistic understanding of the possibilities for their futures. Many wanted to experience love just one time, and some did. They seemed wise beyond their years, having had to grow up quickly to face death head-on. I wasn't surprised by the ending-it was completely real in my experience."
5," 3.5/5 StarsA lovely story about two sick people who are in love with each other. I'm not ashamed to admit that when I first read this I cried. It's simple and snarky and makes you want to re-evaluate your own life and appreciate the little things.On the downside, I feel like Augustus and Hazel are the same person. They talk and think in the same way and if you took away their names, I wouldn't be able to tell who is who.Full Review: http://brittanysbookrambles.blogspot.com/2013/07/the-fault-in-our-stars-by-john-green.html"
5," wasn't expected to enjoy this book so much - but I loved it!  It's the first book in a long time that I couldn't put down and was sneaking time to finish reading.  Although the primary themes and topics are heart-wrenching, the love story between these two characters was so inspiring.  The way in which the author portrayed these characters, showing their brave demeanor and humor at the same time, all seemed so real and natural.  The writing, although very simple and easy, brought the story to life in a meaningful way.  I highly recommend this book to all."
5," Why write one more shining (and not very articulate) review of this book?  Because it is now one of my favorite books, ever.  I purchased this for my kids, thinking if they said there was nothing good to read that I'd hand them this, or one of the many books I purchased for their age range. They haven't read it yet, but I just finished this wondrous, beautiful, poetic, unflinching, sad, happy, well-written, hard to read book.  I've read over a thousand novels in my life, and I loved this as one of the best.  I'm amazed I can still be this amazed by a novel."
2, When this book got popular all of my friends started reading it then they told me You have to read this book it's the best book ever it will make you cry so I said ok and got the book on my kindle even tho I knew who died at the end I cried and cried and cried! I never really read and if I do they don't make me cry but this book made me cry so much! Even tho I have never been in love cause I'm only in middle school and I don't know what she fells like I still cried! And if you haven't read this book then you need to because it's the best one ever
5,t's not often that a book makes me cry. A movie site because it's all happening in front of you. A book...never. how's have time to warm up to the characters and even predict the outcomes. John Greene is almost as unpredictable as Augustus is charming or Van Houten is a jerk. This book is a recipe for water works and personal attachment that leaves me resonating with the characters and asking myself which fate would be better. So I hate you John Greene for making me cry but I love you with more intensity for showing me such a grounded and true love story.
5," John Green is my favorite author. He is my favorite because of his books I have read I have not been disappointed by one of them (sadly I have not been able to read all of them). The Fault in Our Stars was, in my opinion, believable, and I was able to relate to it despite the fact that, well, I do not have cancer. I became quick friends with the characters and formed bonds with them early on in the story. The bond was what made the lives of the characters so poignant to me. I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a book to become their favorite book."
5," There are so many things I can say about this book. So many things. But let me tell you, not ONE of those things are negative. It might have been extremely sad. It WAS extremely sad. But it wasn't without a purpose. Every beautiful word and sentence in this book had a purpose. And even though it was an absolute tear jerker, as they say, none of it felt wrong. Or misused. Or unimportant. This beautiful piece of writing taught me many things. And I am grateful that I took the time to read it. I recommend you do the same. You will not regret it, I promise."
5," Kudos to John Green for The Fault in Our Stars. I've read quite a few books in my time and I can honestly say that I've never been more emotionally attached to a character as I was Hazel. John Green writes with so much passion and emotion that you  fall into Hazel's journey with her. The standpoint of illness he perceives is something completely new. You find yourself not feeling sorry Hazel, but pushing her to fight rather. I would recommend this book to all ages and gender. It'll warm your heart one chapter, then have you crying like a baby the next!!"
5," Okay! This book was amazing! Soooo Many sweet and thoughtful parts in this book.  The author did a GREAT job writing this book, he kept me wanting to read this book.  It honestly only took me a day to read this book, it was that good.  Sad but thoughtful and loving parts!I loved Hazels character, most of the time I hate the girls character they are shallow and obnoxious, but Hazel was the opposite she was thoughtful and a strong character!-Overall this book was more than okay? It was amazing an  worth every cent!Read this book now!"
5," started this book this morning and needless to say, I never stopped reading. I liked this book. Truly, I did. But the characters are unrealistic to say the least. It made me cry, smile, laugh, and mourn in a matter of pages. However, like in An Imperial Affliction, the book ends without finishing the book. Readers don't find out whether or not Hazel dies, what happens to Van Houten, anything. I found this hypocritical considering how much Hazel hated not knowing the ending to AIA.Moreover I thoroughly love this book, even if it had minor glitches."
5," Oh, this book. This beautiful, wonderful book. There are reasons why this book is a best seller. Perhaps it's the phenomenal writing. Or the beautiful characters. Both? Definitely both. This book is the best book I have ever read and I have read A LOT of books in my 16 years of life. It made me laugh and cry and laugh again. No matter what type of books you are into, you definitely should make some time for this one. I promise you will love it from the moment it starts to the moment it ends. The only thing I regret about this book is reading it so fast."
5," Being but a teenager, there were many words in this novel that I could not comprehend, but note  that what I did understand was the message John Green was trying to send. It was that we are all pointless,that we cannot hurt, nor help this universe. But the only thing that we can do is recognise it. We need to stop trying to make marks on the world, and start realizing what we can do. I would definitely read this book no matter your age, because the message it sends is universal. This book was truly an eye-opener. And I hope that it spoke to you as well"
5," am so impressed with this writer. Admittedly, I am a hopeless romantic and shamelessly seek a happy ending in everything I read. I bought this book and sat on it for quite a while knowing I would have to reconcile myself to the tears and sadness I knew would come.Finally, last night I jumped in and while I wasn't wrong....the tears came as did the sadness... so did the laughter and the love. This book crazy smart, funny, and yes, heartbreaking.I suspect I'll read it over and over...and recommend it often.Truly terrific book, wow!!!!"
2," This is a great, emotional read that I enjoyed, even as an adult.  Often young adult books are either a) not well written or b) painfully young and annoying.  Obviously being young is a part of the young adult novel, but there's a difference between a paint-by-numbers version and a well thought out, beautifully written young adult book.  This one definitely falls in the latter category.  The characters were enjoyable and the plot was interesting and kept my interest.  Be prepared for an emotional read, but one that you will enjoy, no matter your age."
5," truly loved the story of Hazel and Augustus. John Green rewrote beautifully, exploring the lives of a few who have cancer. I feel like Hazel and Augustus could be real people, they were so believable. The only thing that kept me from giving 5 stars was the profanity. I suppose some people use a lot of profanity but I don't know any one personally. It surprised me since this I thought this book was targeted to teens, my own teenage daughter being the one who recommended the book to me. I would recommend TFIOS to young adults and older but not teens."
5," What a beautifully written book!  I started this as a kindle sample and from the start was hesitant about the subject matter (who wants to focus on depressing situations?).  You can't help but be pulled in by the main character's voice.  Wise beyond her years (because she has to be), Hazel makes you want to follow her story, even though you have a feeling you know where it's leading.  When Augustus enters the picture, you'll be hard-pressed to put the book down.  I read some great books in 2012, but The Fault in Our Stars will go down as my favorite."
4," My friends all warned me that TFIOS was a tear-jerker, but, for me at least, they were wrong.  I didn't shed a single tear through the entire tragic book, except for when I read the dedication.  I'm glad he wrote it for Esther, it gave an already powerful book an even deeper connection to real life.  I didn't cry for the simple reason that I was in awe.  I kept having to remind myself to blink while reading it.  When I finished I just sat, staring at the book in my hands, wondering at the inevitability of life and the astounding talent of John Green."
5," This book has really caught my attention. I was a little sceptic at first but when I started reading  I couldn't stop. I was up till 2:00 AM one night and something bad happened and I layed there crying like a little baby for a while and continued reading. I have literally never cried at a book before. I've never even willingly read a book, but I'm glad I read this one. It felt like I was experiencing the trauma with them, with Hazel Grace and Gus. Truly an amazing book. I'm only in the 8th grade but this is by far the greatest book I have ever read"
5," Even though this book is labeled as Young Adult I would highly recommend it to anyone.  It's not your typical teen love story because John Green brings a great deal of wisdom and insight to his characters.  Hazel and Gus are not the usual flat character you tend to see in a lot of YA fiction.  They are well developed and easy to imagine.  This book drew me in and wouldn't let me go; I finished it at 3 am after I started reading around 7 pm the night before.  I am putting it on my shelf for now, but I will definitely be returning to it sometime soon."
5," loved this book so much. I refer to john green as the youtuber, but i shall not hover on the thought of him being a beautiful writer. His thoughts are the stars that twinkle across the page, the event to show the truth of what these innocent people are going through. I may be an ignorant ten year old, but these words spoke to me. My relationship with this magical novel is a relationship beyond words, beyond whatever John green could have said. I loved it. May the beautiful couple that looks beautiful live forever on. One love fios&lt;3"
5," knew someone was going to die by the end of the book. At first, of course, Hazel was my main thought, but towards the middle, I had this feeling that Augustus would be the one. I'm not gonna lie, but I kind of read the summary so I cheated a little bit. But I am definitely surprised on how it ended and how the character, Peter, actually was! I still cried when Gus told Hazel that his cancer metastasized and almost EVERY sentence after. Can't wait for the movie! I hope every single part, whether it'd seem miniscule or not, will be in the movie! =D"
5," Although this is about a serious subject, there are many moments in this novel that will make you smile.  It will also provide some insight into the various ways individuals cope while living with cancer.  I know that it will make me think twice in the future about my words and actions that may be well-meaning, but aren't really as helpful as I had hoped.The dialog was very believeable and the characters were multi-dimensional.  It was hard to put this book down once I started it.  I would recommend it to high school age through adults."
5," When I had first opened the book, I was kind of waiting for the awe that everyone said I would experience. Little did I know the experience that was upon me. This book is not a happy ending. It is not sex or romance. It's truth, life, and wisdom. Hazel and Gus are deeper than what they appear to be and so are most characters in this book. It's a tough read with a remarkable message that I'm not even sure I get yet. Just read it and make it your own. Thank you John Green you again manage to blow me away with your originality and unique characters."
2," am a person who never cries during a book , but in this one I was literally bawling so much. I am a teen and if you are too you should for sure buy this book.The fault in our starts has an amazing meaning to it even though so sad. This is such an amazing story including comedy,romance, and it is also very emotional. This book really draws you into reading and its a book that you  cant put down. Its has 313 pages and i finished it in 3 days. I cant describe how much I loved this book. Its is such a beautiful story that I will never forget about."
5," As a physician, I have wanted to write some stories about brave patients, especially children. Here is the story I wish I had written. This is not maudlin! This is funny, adventuresome, inspiring, sometimes confusing, frustrating and beautiful. Recommend this book to people who need to renew their faith in young people and the welfare of the human race.There is really no sickness here, only love of life as it should be.Good for old people to read too..lots of memories can be had.Great language on the pages, clarity is brilliant."
5,"t just changes your outlook on life. It's really amazing in so many ways.A great story that just stays with you and makes you really consider things differently. Better.Didn't read it- listened to the audio book through Audible. The narrator - Kate Rudd- was amazing. She really made the story come to life. All the characters, everything. Amazing.Couldn't put it down. Listened to the whole thing in two days of just listening whilst walking around my town for hours and hours.Couldn't break away from it. Simply great."
5," tell my students any book that makes you feel is a well written book. This is a well written book. I found myself laughing out loud (that's not just text speak) at times and literally sobbing at others. God bless my poor neighbors. They probably think they are living next to a maniac. This was my first introduction to John Green. Now, I am hooked. I can't get enough of his books. Sadly, I think I am only lacking reading one or two of his books. What will I do when I've read through his repertoire? I guess I'll have to reread some of my faves."
5," A book about teenage kids dying of cancer sounds like a depressing way to entertain one's self, I agree. I'm a crier by nature, though, and didn't find this overwhelmingly sad in the shocking, Nicholas Sparks kind of way. I loves the way Hazel's mind worked &amp; reading her thoughts. Admittedly, I felt like the book was predictable, but I still enjoyed seeing it unfold in my head page after page. I think this might be a good choice for someone dying of cancer, or someone who just enjoys philosophizing about the impermanence of the human condition."
5," have no way to describe this story that would do it justice.  But it is about deepest love, agonizing pain, the most important questions and philosophical answers, all told with wry humor, wonderful vocabulary and literary references, as experienced  and in the voice of a few very special teens.  And for those of us who are lucky enough to have loved and lost to cancer but would do it again, and/or those of us lucky enough to have intelligent, humorous deep-thinking children like Hazel and Augustus, this book was written for you.  And for me."
4, loved the romance about this book. Their love for each other was so unique. So amazing. I want more. It shows how teenagers can have an amazing love for each other. To show either when sick or healthy you are still able to love and care for each other. I really hope they make a movie for this book. I hate how Augustus died though. But that's what makes it a book. The disappointments and the good things are what makes the book so fantastic and makes you want to read more. This is my favorite book now. It was the greatest book I have ever read.
5," read this book in one sitting, which I had never been able to do before (I wouldn't suggest doing this unless you want to be punched in the face repeatedly with feelings, however). I absolutely loved how John Green could so perfectly depict a teenager, and I'm a huge fan of his writing style.I'm also not a big fan of teen love stories, because they all seem to be way too cliche and corny for me, but words can't even express how much I loved this one.If you don't read this book, you are making a huge mistake. It's honestly perfect."
5, Wasn't sure if I wanted to give this 3 or 4 stars. The story and writing I have no problems with but I think the story became more about a book that both Hazel and Gus read that they wanted answers about. I also think it was a little too deep for. 14 yr. old to read. I intended to have my granddaughter read it but half way through decided it would be the wrong decision. A little too deep and emotional for many youth to deal with. I did like the love story with two children becoming connected through their cancer and I did she'd tears.
5," *No spoilers :)* The Fault in our Stars is a great addition to my book collection. John Green always delivers, and it is especially true with his newest book. I did not put this book down until I finished. My adventure with Gus and Hazel was a great one: I laughed, I cried, I had fun. TFioS is a moving in-sight into a different world. It may be a fictional story, but to me, there's someone in the world living that story. The story is literally perfect (incorrect use of literality?) and I don't think I'll need to search for a sequel to this one."
2," Today, I finally finished this book. I wish there was a sequel. Like with that one writer that I can't remember the name of. I wish I would have at least an epilogue. But no, you ended the book like that terrible writer, slightly better though. I hope you know how heart breaking this book is. I cried most the time. Now I know what people are thinking about. I wish Augustus hadn't died, that he lived, but what would have happened if he did. What would the out come of that be. Have a nice life, probably cackling at people like me. But who knows."
5," knew from the beginning something bad would occur to Hazel I had just figured this out from the trailer but what I got was so different from what I expected. SPOILER ALERT Augustus dies in a totally unexpected ending that I felt more saddened about than if Hazel had died because now someone that was so close to her has died and now she is counting down her time. The only reason I give this four stars is because I want to know if Van Houten wrote a sequel, I want to know what happened to Hazel. There is no way the movie can do justice to this"
4," A classmate of mine told me about John Green and this book, saying it is a piece of great modern literature. I never thought that I would agree with him for the first time.Green' s work is just amazing, and I think everyone in the whole wide world should read it. Really.Hazel's narration of the so-called oblivion to the letter of Augustus to Van Houten is just WOW.It's simply just a life-changing story about 2 people who have cancer, who falls into the warm and embracing hands of that extraordinary, stupid thing called love."
4," Okay. Wow. That was definitely the funniest, saddest, and most insightful book that I have ever read. Where I usually read adventure and fantasy and manga and classics,  this was so directly meaningful and realistic. Where Van Houten went from inspirational to a dick to probably my favorite character next to Isaac, who hated life and made it better. And then to Hazel, who was tough and made such a horrible situation a moderate one. And Augustus who gave Hazel freedom, strength and courage. I can't imagine anyone buying and reading this book."
5,", like many others, waited for this book for a long time and the anticipation did not take away from this book. The Fault In Our Stars is beautiful, heartbreaking, funny, honest, and so relatable that it almost hurt to read it at times. This is by far John Green's best work and has already become one of my favorite books. Although this is not a cancer book as Hazel Grace would say, I think if you have been touched by cancer in any way that this book will speak to you. An honest look at what it's like to be 16, falling in love, and terminal."
5," August Waters steals the show in this book. He is bigger than life and he transcends the cancer that eats at him. He doesn't let it define him and he won't allow it to define his friends. He always seems to know the right thing to do or say to bring his friends not only out of their funk but into an incredible world that only he can create. The world IS a better place with Augustus Waters in it and thanks to John Green, he will forever be in the world. Be prepared with tissues, I think even the most hardened reader will sniffle at this one."
5," honestly don't know how to review this in a way that would do the book justice.  This story was beautiful, touching, and yes, sad.  There was still a lot of beauty even in the sadness.  Not to sound corny, but it really was one of those books that touches your heart and soul.  Hazel was awesome, but it was Augustus who truly stole my heart.  I was completely surprised at how much I laughed and smiled while reading this.  Even though tears were shed and my heart hurt, I am so glad I read this.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone."
5," had no clue what to expect when I picked up this book, but I'm glad I did!!! It gives you such an amazing and unique insight to childhood cancer. It really shows you some of the things most of us will hopefully never have to go through, but does happen too much. It shows you just a little bit of something you will never really understand unless you go through yourself, and gives you so much respect for people with cancer. You really realize how strong they are and have to be. I love this book so much, and you will too, so read it please!!"
5," This book made me laugh and cry (on the inside) and moved me. It was perfect in every single way possible. It explored death in a way that I had never thought of before, and put the important aspects of life into perspective. John Green is one of my favorite authors and was even before this book. But after I put it down, I felt like I could have read it again. I'm going to end my review now because I can't possibly describe the amazingness of this book to you in words and eventually I'll just start making words up. So, baisically, read it."
5," There are so many reason why this book is fantastic. It is beautifully written, it's characters are fascinating and real in so many ways, it allows you to think critically and ask yourself big questions, and it moves fast enough to keep you from getting bored. It's funny and sad and brilliant. I've read it five times now and still find new things to love about it. I have 3 copies, 2 physical and one on my kindle, just so I can share this experience with them while allowing myself the experience again. I cannot recommend this book enough."
2," This was an excellent book. A bit over the top in terms of the conversations between the main characters who are a bit weird (their conversations and topics are over the top in many cases!) but overall a very good read; the ending is unexpected and very sad. Of course, we know that these two kids have cancer but I guess that throughout the book we're hoping for a mircle to happen. But it's real life that kicks in instead. I'd definitely recommend this novel to teenagers and would probably use it for a class novel as well.Lynn"
5," John Green does amazing, as always, with his newest book! I've always been a huge fan of them, and since he announced the book on Vlogbrothers, and read the first two chapters, I was hooked. I couldn't wait until I got my signed copy in my hands.  I read the entire book in just a few hours, and then proceeded to read the book again, and again, and again.This book will take you on an emotional roller coaster. At the end of the book, I felt as if the characters were real, and felt the pain as they went through situations.GET THIS BOOK."
5," Downloaded this book from Amazon after seeing it on one of those top read/book of the month lists.From the onset, the author grabbed me with his laugh out loud lines and quirky,fast paced banter between the lead characters. The big C is definitely a tough subject to tackle  and this author does it with grace. For anyone who has been personally affected by this terrible disease or have had family members undergone the painful, debilitating treatments, this book was simply a testament to to the strength of the human spirit."
5," My friends recommended this book to me. After a failed attempt for the one gal to nab it from the library... I finally bought it against my will. I'm truly glad I did. I will attempt the book gets plenty sad but I just loved it. I'm not even one for the depressing books, yet I put up &amp; balled my eyes out through it. I felt like you could never know what was going to happen next... or maybe that's just absent minded me. I thoroughly enjoyed The Fault In Our Stars &amp; look forward to going back &amp; reading it AGAIN which doesn't happen much."
5," This book is obviously not meant to be light. Cancer isn't light. I did find myself laughing out loud at times, though. And at other times, it had me openly weeping in public. The book is beautifully written, and Green allows his characters to tell what feels like an honest story--a perspective on illness that I think is under represented in mainstream literature. The book is also sprinkled with really poignant remarks on life and love and death. And there are moments in the book that are pure poetry. I couldn't ask for anything more."
5," found this to be a beautiful book.  You already know it is about teenagers with cancer so if that bothers you, don't read it.  The book does exactly what the author intended, which is to make it about the teenagers, not the cancer.  They come alive as regular kids (well, exceptional kids)who happen to have cancer.  It's not about fighting the disease, it's about them.  I am an adult so don't let the fact that it is YA deter you.  I often judge a book by how much I think about it after I finish it, and I think about this one a lot."
5," The proper ratio of laugh to cry in a book is not hard to achieve. We feel hurt better than we feel happy, so the proper ratio falls somewhere in about 1:4. However well this book meets that standard, I can not statistically attest to, but I can say that it felt like perfection with a splash of champagne. Read and you will know what I mean.  Also, it is a good read if you wish to be content with your mind's quirks and enjoy other's through these characters. It will assist you in leading an examined life and there is no better gift."
5," have heard the author and the actors from the movie discuss this book and story. They all said, “This is not a story about two kids with cancer, it is a story about two kids falling in love. True, this is a love story, however; every page....almost every sentence is about cancer, disease, treatments, medications, pain, loss, death. This is a story about cancer and dying first and a love story second. I never relaxed into to this story and celebrated their love for one another; instead I suffered and focused on their dying."
5," think this is my favorite book ever. Every few months I take it out and read it again! It is a beautiful story capturing a unique perspective on the teenage experience. But most importantly (for me) it transmits, quite perfectly, the experience of being a teenager with cancer in today's society.When I first read the book I assumed that only cancer survivors would appreciate and be able to relate to this story. Yet as I now see from this book's extraordinary popularity, I was quite wrong!I highly recommend this book!"
5," From the synopsis I think it is safe to guess there will be tears. and there will be.But there will also be a lot of laughs, sometimes at the same time as the tears, and a story/characters that will remain with you long after the last page. An adult reader who ventures into ya from time to time so that I may discuss books with my niece, I  can safely say I will gift this hjs story to any and all who will accept a book from me. Beautifully written, amazing story told -for any reader with a heart -don't miss it. start reading now!"
2," This is a predictably unpredictable story of two teenaged star-cross lovers, who also happen to be cancer patients. What makes the novel so good though, is not the plot, intriguing though it is, but the vivacity of the language, which grabs you and pulls you forward ensuring that if you are able to put the book down, it won't be for very long.Although this has been classified as a young-adult novel, I would recommend this heart-wrenching story to all readers, the grizzled and gray haired among you included."
5," Because the teenage girls in my life encouraged me to read the blockbuster book The Fault in Our Stars, I did. At first, I was charmed by the quirky characters and raw honesty. Then, I became disheartened, even angry. Without spoiling the plot for those who might see the movie or read the book, I think parents should have a conversation with their kids about the sexual content. Though this will be portrayed as a love story, parents need to ask their teens what constitutes real love, and do these characters meet that measure. I will say that at least the book does not violate its own moral code - its worldview is very nihilistic, and the teens in this book are true to that. If you believe there is not an eternity, then the only thing that matters is what happens here and now. I am saddened that teens will be charmed by the characters without ever questioning the worldview."
5," This book was amazing. Sad but amazing. I was crying so hard. I didn't even know how to stop crying. It's this love between 2 characters and then when love is put to the test and everything seems to be falling apart you have to use that love and help each other out. Cancer just wants to be alive like everybody in the world wants. You can't blame it. Although cancer can be very deadly it just wants to be alive, searching for something that most of the time will get. That's how the love in this book is. It just wants to be alive."
2," As my first John Greene novel, the book surprised me. I had heard many people rave about it, but I am a harsh critic and must read things for myself. The book was written so well and the story line followed as to keep the reader interested throughout the entire thing. I couldn't put the book down. John Greene has a way with words that many people aspire to in this day and age. He made me fall in love, ripped my heart out, and made it,well I won't say whole again, worth having it broken. Thank you my dear friend for the journey."
5,"ve been a fan of John's work ever since I picked up my first copy of Looking for Alaska, so needless to say I was ecstatic to get my copy of The Fault in Our Stars.I started reading as soon as I took it out of the package and couldn't put it down until I had finished.I was laughing, crying, and 'awww!'ing my way through the entire novel.It's beautifully spun with heartache, tragedy, and hope. John even did an amazing job as narrating through a 16 year old girls perspective.Definitely some of his best work yet."
5," ...just read Scott's review. I have nothing to add. I put off reading this book because I knew I'd be a red faced, swollen eyed, slobbing mess at the end of it and I completely was but in the best way possible. I adore John Green and all of the characters he introduces us to, but oh my Jebus, Hazel and Augustus.HAZEL!!!!!!!!!!!!AUGUSTUS!!!!!!!!!ISAAC!!!!!!!!!!!!Enjoy this amazing book and let it seep into your veins and make you feel like you have the coolest group of friends this side of the milky way."
5," This is the first time I have ever left a review for a book if that tells you anything.  I have liked many books, but I loved this one!  I was on a roller coaster of emotions and I loved every minute of it.  I will cherish the insight of viewing life from someone whose losing their own.  I wanted to highlight so many things in this story and I have never done that before.  The best one is definitely  the world is not a wish-granting factory. Feeling so blessed to have stumbled upon this book. Everyone should read this book!"
5," When I first started this book, I had to put it aside.  I didn't realize its characters were struggling with cancer.  It was too close to home as I am battling stage 4 cancer myself.  But about a month later, I was looking for something to read and went back to it.  I loved the dialogue and the characters and just couldn't put it down.  As difficult as it was emotionally to read at some points, the characters just carried me through.  I don't hang around with many 16-year-olds but I'd love to meet some as insightful as these."
5," This is the single best book I have ever read. In one night I have managed to laugh and cry more than ever in a book and I would not have traded it for anything. There were so many thoughts I had while reading this book and every single one of them was more important than any silly question I have ever asked myself. I am so proud to say I have read this book and I hope that every single person gets to meet their Gus Waters in their life. Bavo John, encore! Really thank you so much, I could not hav asked for more in any book."
5," This book made me literally laugh out loud! It touched my heart in ways a book has never  been able to accomplish. However, not only did I laugh, but I cried. I bawled. I cried  for over two hours trying to continue to read through my tears. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone. It hurts and it touches and it uplifts and it takes you out of the world that you think sucks so much, into a world that should be hated and resented, by  instead it's cherished and feverent to be made the most of. Seriously. Read this book."
2," Not one of the fastest readers out there, but this book was so good that I had trouble putting it down- i finished it in 3 days!  This novel sincerely changed my life (for the better) and put ideas into consideration that I never even thought about.  It opened my eyes.  I hardly ever cry at the ends of books, but John Green's eloquent language and emotion made me cry a waterfall at the end.  This book is so realistic and the reader can feel the characters' struggles and pain, happiness and joy.  This novel is a Must-Read."
5," John Green is an incredible writer who knows how to walk a reader through life's harsh realities without manipulating your emotions. This is a beautiful story told from the perspective of Hazel--a 16 year old girl with stage four thyroid cancer--and her unflinching look at life and love as she faces her mortality by living in every moment. Beautiful, funny at times and completely wrought with emotion. This story left me with a heavy heart, but also with a new appreciation for living. And yes, I cried. Well done Mr. Green."
5," am not a big reader, in fact the only books I really have read are Harry potter 1-4, Chronicles of Narnia, and of course The Hunger Games.  For my new years resolution, I decided to try reading as many books as I could (I didn't want to set a limit for myself or a unreachable target).  I am very happy that I decided to start with this book!  I fell in love with the characters, the two main characters have such great personalities!  It was very well written!  I look forward to reading more of Green's works in the future!"
5," Green gives teenagers their due by letting us see what brilliant creatures they are when adults aren't watching. When you work closely with teens for many years you know how resilient they are, how deep their thoughts really can go, and you learn that they do notice more than we can ever imagine. Thanks to Green we can see their thinking! But.....what happens to Hazel? Do her parents stay together? Does her mom become a Patrick? And what about Issac? I'm booking a flight to Indiana tonight!!"
5," Although I'm a fan of all his work, this is John Green at his best. The Fault in Our Stars reaches a whole new level of perfection. I cannot get over its beauty.  I cried, I laughed aloud, and I just kept turning the pages; simply mesmerized. Mr. Green builds astonishingly real characters that you will fall in love with. It will be something that I read over and over again. It made me think, feel, and ultimately gave me some peace about the limited time we have here on earth. I must thank John Green for creating this."
5," thoroughly enjoyed John Green's writing! The book journeys through the human experience in a vulnerable, thought provoking, insightful way. Though the aim is for young adults, there are many insights that the author is able to convey that transcend age or demographics. The author's words speak right to the heart of the reader. Green reveals each character's nuances brilliantly and by the final pages, as a reader, you have walked alongside of Hazel and Augustus as a friend. I would highly recommend this book to anyone!"
5," absolutely love this novel. There's a mixture of drama, romance, and occasional comedy. I felt like all of the char characters were well-developed and/or at least likable. The The actual characterization itself is also strong, with almost each person talking or acting in a different way than the others. I wish the vocabulary had been a little less simple, but in some cases, it was also realistic that way, because of a teenager telling the story. There are also a number of good quotes. This page-turner is a must-read."
5," John Green managed to single handedly destroy my feelings. I will not be able to move for the next several days, as i will be sitting in bed, contemplating the meaning of life and all the lessons Green implants in this novel. 63,926,471 out of ten stars. I love Green, but I also have to hate him, because I will l not be able to function anymore after coming to love Gus so dearly.-Sarah, age 16Also. If there is ever a movie version of this, somebody please tell me where to audition for Hazel Grace Lancaster."
5," started it yesterday, and within the first sentence, I was in love. I got the audio book to listen to while I had a headache, but my mind demanded to comprehend every word while I tried to sleep. I have had a total of three hours of sleep in the past day, the rest of the time I have been reading and rereading this book, and crying when Augustus dies. You can definitely tell John Green wrote this book. It has the same sarcasm as he does in his Vlogbrothers videos. My favorite book and I highly recommend it. -Cheyenne"
5," This story is beautifully written and goes by way too quickly.  I was thinking about the characters whenever I put the book down, and finished it sooner than I wanted, though I *had* to know how the story ended.  It was a wonderful dilemma as a reader, and rarely do you get that chance to enjoy a book so much you hate for it to end.I laughed and cried my way through this book and am amazed my Kindle still works despite the amount of tears it collected.  Poignant and wonderful.  A great book club book, too."
2," This was a wonderful book to read.  I will disclaimer my review that I am * young at heart but not young adult.  I had no expectations of this book, only great reviews, which I did not read.  I jumped into this book.  I smiled, I laughed, I cried.  What a story of life on the terms of reality when dealt the card of illness; cancer to be direct.  Personally, I have been touched since May with facing untimely deaths and this book was just what I needed; another touch of loving reality.  Life is so good...grab the gusto."
5," Looking for Alaska is my favorite book of all time, but after reading The Fault in Our Stars, I might have to amend that. This is very stereotypical to say, but it made me laugh, it made me cry, and it left a really big impact on my life. The characters are all so different and lively, and it's really interesting to see the perspective of someone my age going through cancer. Even if you're not into teen books, I really recommend reading The Fault in Our Stars; it's not your average hormonal-teen-falls-in-love novel."
5," Not many books have brought me to tears. I consider the ones that have great successes. In order for a book to make me cry, I need a great attachment to the characters, and full absorption into the story. The Fault In Our Stars made me cry at least 10 times, and I wouldn't even consider it a sad story.I read The Fault In Our Stars cover to cover in one sitting. This book is John Green's best work yet. I highly recommend it to anyone. Don't be put off by the stigma of the young adult genre. It is truly fantastic."
5," So many people told me that I just HAD to read this book, so I did, and let me tell you, I don't regret it one bit. John Green did a fantastic job. I was worried that maybe it'd be too cliché. It wasn't. I was also scared that the book would end like AIA and I would have an endless amount of questions like Hazel Grace, and I would have to hunt down John green to find all the answers, but luckily that isn't the case. I'm glad that I read this book, and I can not wait to see how well the book is portrayed in the movie."
5," This book is one of a kind. It is not really a story as it is more of a life lesson. A book that makes you see the world differently is rare. The character's thoughts are so deep you can see right into their soul, and sometimes you may catch yourself thinking you are really there, or even that you ARE the character. It is not a book you can simply blow through as a time-passer, but one you have to take the time out to read; a book that is for people who enjoy reading. Many of the ideas in this book will stay with me."
5," Such a great book! I don't know what to say. It made me cry, it made me want to live life to the fullest, it made me feel all sorts of feelings. Hazel and Augustus are two remarkable characters who understand each other so well. Their bodies have suffered but they try not to let it bother them. There is so much to say, but I don't want to give any part of the story away. It's just a beautiful and well-written story. Yes, there will be tears, but the way you feel after you've read the book...it's almost life changing."
5,"f you haven't read all the other reviews about this book, feel free to read mine! This book was perfect. I don't know how to describe this in any other way. It took me a looong time to finish this book because I just didn't want it to end...I finally finished it before the movie and boy... finishing the book and watching the movie in one week is something I just don't recommend. I think I just came out of my depression... Please buy this book if you are suffering from an euphoric high and need to come down from it."
5," CAUTION SPOILERS I can't put into words how this book has affected me.  John Green is a miracle worker in every sense of the phrase.  When Augustus dies, even though he is a fictional character and no one really knew him, I felt like I had lost a huge portion of my life when I read the sentence:  Augustus died 8 days after his prefuneral.  I was shocked and then dissolved into tears.  Augustus deserved many more years than he got in my opinion and he should have spent them with Hazel. Okay? Okay."
5," This book is a page turner. I had already seen the movie, but I like to read the books too to get more of the author's and character's perspectives. I was pleased while reading to find that Hollywood kept their production authentic and true to the book. I was also very pleased to get an even greater in depth look into Hazel and Augustus' thoughts and feelings. I personally fell in love with both characters and find Augustus' optimism and outlook contagious. Love love love this book. I highly recommend it to anyone!"
5," don't know how to put this book into words... I started reading this late last night and was unable to stop reading until the very last word. This book made me laugh, and it made me cry. It truly is one of the greatest books I have read. To those who have yet to read this book I suggest that you have a box of tissues nearby. And to the author Mr. John Green I cannot thank you enough for having written such a truly moving book, you truly are an artist, and I wish you the best of luck with your future works of art."
2," smiled, I laughed, I cried, and felt a great loss when I finished this book. A great book is certainly one that captures your heart and leaves an impression when it's finished. I think to really appreciate this book, you cannot focus so much on the characters but the perspective of life, of reality, of love, that was wonderfully written in a non-cliche way. My hat is off to John Green for this masterpiece. Insight and maturity are necessities to understand the deep message of this wonderfully breathtaking story."
5," This book is amazing! It has a wonderful twist to it that was very upsetting however made the book even more interesting. I am so grateful that this book was written. I feel amazing about John Green 's success with this novel. I honestly this should be put as the best book of 2k14! I wish there were so many more novels that had an amazing story line like this. But no, there can only be one of this book. It is absolutely wonderful and I recommend it to anyone. PLEASE READ THIS BOOK, YOU WILL LOVE IT NO DOUBT!!!&lt;3"
5," This book did not disappoint in any way. The comical and emotional aspects of the story did not over power each other. It was truly the perfect balance. One minute I'm laughing hysterically, the next, crying hysterically. John Green has this incredible ability to create characters that you find your self irrationally attracted too. I felt like I knew these characters personally. Even minor character had develop such s profound life of their own. This was truly one of the greatest books I've read in a long time."
5," picked this book up in a bookstore when I had an hour to kill ... I hadn't heard anything, and had no expectations.It was truly phenomenal.As one can see from then &gt;2,000 previous reviews, I'm jumping on a bandwagon. But this story really managed to reorient how I think about life and death (and I'm finishing medical school, planning on a career specializing in palliative care, so this is something I've thought about).Clearly, I can't speak eloquently ... So, read this!"
5," Loved the writing, unexpected dialogue, character development and plot of this book. I cried for the whole last half, but somehow the book made me feel really good. I've never had cancer, nor been close to a young person who did (knock on wood), but somehow I felt that these characters represented what it was like--their relationships amongst each other, humor, (sometimes dark) sarcasm and ability to accept the reality of their situation and the fleetingness of life. It made me feel so grateful for my 30 years."
5," was hesitant to even start a book about teenagers and cancer but so glad I did.  This is one of those books you find yourself thinking of again and again.  It is poignant and heart wrenching to be sure, but so thoroghly provocative it remains active in your scope of humanity. Mainly you will smile. ..and smile. ..and smile some more. Now and then you can't help but laugh out loud....just don't tell anyone around you that you're reading a book about three teenagers dying of cancer. Note ,too, this is fiction."
5," Language created first from man's desire to join in experiencing the world with one another, is transcended  in this exquisite story to a great and endless ocean of possibilities, to ponder the greatest and deepest of human emotion and meaning.  Inspiring. Compelling.  Unique. To say this is a story about teens with cancer, would be as if to call The Grapes of Wrath a story of a poor family. My humble words cannot begin to express my admiration for John Green's writing.  I cannot wait to read more of his work."
5," loved this book. I read it so fast that I regret, because it was an amazing read. The book is just so amazing you will want read more and more until it's done. The story is sad, but beautiful at the same time, and the story is just amazingly written. You get to see the world from the perspective of a teenager with cancer, you feel like you're her in this story. If you're looking for a new novel, try this one. You will fall in love with it! Can't wait for the movie. I hope it's amazing just like the book is."
5,"ve read at lot of extraordinary book in my life. But I could accurately describe those books using singular adjectives and nouns and attempt to express my pleasure. But I couldn't fathom doing so with this book. I suppose I couldn't ever sum it up  to be exceptional or truly amazing as my title suggests. Be cause if I could, I would have done a horrendous disservice to John Green 's work. The only thing I could say and have the ability to be the least bit accurate was that I wish I owned it in hardback."
5," This book may be put in the young adult section, but it should be read by everyone.  It is a well written, grab you book.  John Green called into the book store One More Page.  It was so interesting to hear him talk about the characters he brought to life in this book.  In this book, Hazel's voice was so strong.  It was great to watch her take control and express herself in a forward, but not nasty way.  The characters in this book are realistic, have honest emotions.  They have flaws.  I really did enjoy it."
2," haven't read it yet, but I intend to. Just a blurb here and there that my daughter read aloud to me. My daughter, the one that is 15 so hates to read because it takes away from time with her friends on instagram or face time. She actually devoured this book, reading parts aloud because she was so excited by it. Did it make her want to read another book? No. Of course not. But the fact that she knocked this back in two days and wept, and wept, means to me, that it's amazing. Can't wait to read it myself. :)"
5," The Fault in our Stars is an amazing Book. Its about 2 teens, Hazel and Augustus. Hazel had cancer and her mother Forces her to go to This support group to help her, She then meets Augustus. She becomes friends With him, it turns into this Spiral of them starting to love Each other. I don't to Give away the Ending, you will just Have to read It. If you liked this Book you need to read all of John's Other books. Its a must read for all Nerdfighters. (We are like Normal people but made Of pure Awesome) DFTBA"
5," This book was a book like no otherOther books express the perfect side of human nature, where  every one lives happily ever afterThe thing is, there is no perfect sideEveryone has to cope with flaws and illnessesThe Fault in Our Stars really expressed thatIt gave a story of a young teenager, with cancer, living through through the difficulties of her body. It explains that everyone passes away but some leave a bigger impact or scar on th  people they leave  behind than others."
5," finally read this after several of my students (I teach high school English) and friends recommended it. I was kind of expecting a Jodi Picoult-type teen angst cancer book, but this was truly a remarkable book. Heartbreaking but not in a cheap way--in a way that felt really, really authentic. I bawled my eyes out for pretty much the last fourth of it, but in a good, cathartic way. I liked the characters, loved the deep dialogue, and believed the love story. It was just a beautiful book. Strongly recommend."
5," This book ... is... first of all, it's amazing. I saw it so many times and finally today, i decided to read it since it was so short. It has changed my life and i am not even finished with it. I've known so many people with cancer and it's made me change how i look at even them. I laughed and cried during this book and it's because its real. It's the kind of book that makes you feel. I see why its on the list of best books of 2012. It's definitely worthy of the claim. I would recommend this book to everyone."
5," There are good books written every day. Books that are sweet. Witty. Happy. Sad. There are even books that get you thinking about things that you don't typically think of. I really like those kind. But best of all, there are these rare books that take you to another world that makes you feel like you're experiencing something special. Like it is some undeniably spectacular moment in time that you are blessed to be of the few who experience it. This is one of them that is worthy of all, and more. Okay, okay."
5," This book was an incredibly amazing book. I don't know anyone who has cancer, but this book touched me so much.The characters were fantastic, the story made me laugh on some pages, while on others I was crying, and I was very connected to the book. I finished this book in one day because I could not put it down!I look forward to reading more of John Green' s books. This is my all time favorite book, if you haven't read it , what are you waiting for?This book will be a legacy"
5," This book is AMAZING and so sad. I can't wait till they make it into a movie. The characters were awesome and I was so engrossed in the story, I missed my stop on the train several mornings. I think classifying this as young adult fiction will keep adults from reading it and they will miss out. However, all young adults SHOULD read it so they can appreciate their health and empathize with ANYONE who has cancer/any type of health problems. It was truly well written and great for all ages. LOVED LOVED LOVED!"
5," This must be one of the best written books on what is to be a cancer sufferer from a teenage point of view I have ever come across. It has a dry, earthy and cynical humour that takes the pain out of the situation, it just grabs your attention from beginning to end. It is not sanctimonious or fairy-dust type of writing but gritty and real. Mind you, the ending is a shocker, but it's good - not everyone does live happily ever after, and you know what? That's life! I cannot recommend this book highly enough."
5," thought this was a really good book, I can't wait to watch the movie. Be warned though, I don't usually cry easy, but I really cried while reading this. I thought John Green did a really impressive job of making the characters believable and I fell in love with them while reading the story. The romance part was a tad cheesy and romanticized, of course, but didn't make me roll my eyes as much as other teen romance books *cough* Eleanor &amp; Park *cough*. I recommend this book if you like young adult novels."
2," When i started reading this book i was doubting if i would enjoy the story as the characters were in a quite depressing condition. As the story progress, i started loving the characters and their witty banters. This book is one of those books that when you're done reading, you would ponder about life. It makes you think, makes you see things in a different perspective. It is funny, engaging, the characters are lovable/adorable  and it is heartbreaking. I highly recommend this book. it is one of the best."
5," Once we live, we must die.  John Green's book has an economy of beauty that is heartbreaking.  This isn't an overwrought deliberate tear-jerker that is emotionally manipulative - quite the contrary. It almost tries to persuade you to stop that crying because all of this living and suffering and dying is completely normal.  The tears weren't for the emotion, it was for the author's ability to penetrate a little into the mystery of life and our tenuous and tenacious grasp on it by the simple act of loving."
5," didn't just cry reading this book. I cried like a maniac. Fetal position, spooning the pillow, shaking my head repeatedly.There's so much beauty in The Fault in Our Stars, such a delicate, profound beauty.I just want to thank John Green and every single one who read this novel and was passionate about it, your word-to-mouth eventually got to me and gave me the chance to witness this pearl. And yes, I'm being corny but, you know what?, I'm also eating a slice of pizza.Thank you again."
5," was not really sure about the book at first...but then instead of just looking at the cover, I actually read the book and fell in love. This book has everything tied in a perfect bundle. It has some mystery, humor, sadness, adventure, and romance. It is by far my favorite book of all time. Oh and a note to people who actually decide to read this, you will NOT be disappointed.This is a book that you will read, without a doubt, more than once. Thank You and have a nice morning/afternoon/day/evening! :)"
5," This book is by far one of my favorites, of course all of John Green's nooks are amazing. But The Fault in Our Stars just gave me such a deep connection to the characters unlike any book I've read before. I felt like Augustus and Hazel were my friends and I peering into their life. This books brought out laughs, thoughts, and tears from me. It is truly an AMAZING book and I would recommend it to anyone, except, I feel sort of like Hazel with all of John Green's books and just want them for myself haha"
5," bought this book and by the end of the first page I was caught. I read until I finished it within a couple of hours. It was by far one of the most beautiful books I've read in a long time. It was hilarious, touching, morbid, thought-provoking, and definitely a book I will no doubt re-read countless times. I recommend this to all, as a young cancer survivor myself (diagnosed at 8 years and currently 21), please read, you will NOT be disappointed. This book is moving and I love a book that changes me."
5, This is not surprisingly one of the most depressing and hopeless books I have ever read. What shocks me is1. I actually read the whole thing and2. So many other people LOVED it.I can't even begin to describe the meaningless feeling upon finishing this book and an overall sense that I wasted my time reading it. If you believe that there is any point to life or that a higher power is in any way involved in our existence DO NOT read this book. You will feel empty and very disappointed.
5," don't cry because of works of fiction. I have remained completely dry eyed through things that have left my friends balling their eyes out. Not so with this book. I am talking nose dripping, eyes puffy, face red kind of crying for the last forty pages. Not to sound cliche but at one point I was actually laughing and crying at the same time. I'm not good with words and I can't accurately describe the way this book made me feel so all I will say is this: Read it. Read it because it needs to be read."
2," loved the book. It does make you cry so if you decide to read it I recommend that you have tissues next to you. There is so much that you can learn from this book. You can learn that love truly is forever, and that not everything is always in your favor. I recommend this book for readers who like romances and realism. This story is not like a princess story, it shows you that a happily ever after doesn't always exist. I would very much like a sequel. But then again not everything is in your favor."
5,ncredible! Why are books you love so hard to review? I can't believe this book was not actually written by Hazel Grace! How can a 30 something year old man have captured the voices of 17 year old adolescents so faultlessly. It is almost impossible not to fall in love with Hazel and Gus and wish you were 17 all over again falling in love for the first time but being grateful and aware of just how lucky we were. I wholeheartedly recommend you read this book. It will stay with me for a very long time.
2," read this book, by chance, only about a week after it was released.  My first impression involved my friend crying through the last hour of a bus ride as she finished - and this book made me sob, too.  After this, I went on to read other of John Green's books, but I still consider this one his best.This book has topped my list of favorite, well written books of all time, and this comes from someone who enjoys everything from teen romance to Tolkien's Silmarillion.  Well worth reading."
5, This book is listed for teens but it's appeal is broad. It is one of the most memorable books I have ever read. The characters are so real and likable but the story is heart wrenching without being maudlin or sad. I had no idea what it was about but bought it because it had so many 5 stars. It hooked me from the first page and just kept getting better and better. It's a quick read and I recommend it for everyone. Don't be put off by it being a youth book. It's a brilliant story and so well written.
5, didn't think I was going to LOVE it.  I thought it would depress me but I saw the great reviews and wanted something that I wouldn't stall on out of boredom.  As I read I realized that I wasn't going to be able to put this book down until I knew exactly what was going to happen to the characters.  And finally as I read the last page I felt a true sense of loss that I no longer shared space with these people.  I LOVE this book.  It'll stay with me as long I have the ability to access my memories.
5," have always been a huge fan of John Green  since I read Looking For Alaska. His books have never disappointed me and The Fault in our Stars was no exception. I've read each of his books several times. I would recommend any of his books, not just to the young adult generation but to all adults. John Green writes beautiful books about topics univerversal to so many individuals. If you haven't had the pleasure of reading one of his books defintely check them out. I promise you wont be disappointed."
5," read this book with no prior knowledge of what it was about, and I bought it soley based on the author whom I knew only as a youtuber. When I heard this book was becoming a movie, I quickly picked it up.And promptly cried my eyes out.This is a quick read, it was hard to put down! Its a beautiful and heartbreaking love story that hits a lot of emotions. One chapter I was angry, then laughing, and then I would bawl my eyes out.Its an amazing story, would reccomend :)"
5," Every time I wanted into my local bookstore, I saw this book &amp; kept telling myself that I should get it. I've  heard tons of good reviews on it &amp; that it wasn't just a cancer book, but more. So when I got my Kindle, I made it my first purchase. I'm in no way disappointed. This really was one  of the best books I've read. It was sarcastic, it was sad, I laughed, I cried. John Green is amazing. This book deserves its Goodreads choice award. Everyone should read this book. You won't be disappointed."
5," When I read this book, I felt what the words meant. John Green had an amazing way or writing and wording things. This book isn't just a read and then be done book. No this book stays with. This book makes you want to do something remarkable, and be something remarkable. It shows you how stupid it is to let fear, pain, and loss hold you back. This book makes you aspire to be an Augustus, or Hazel, with your own young, and reckless love. A love full scars, okays, and eloquently thought out words."
5," Seriously. Get some tissues.Or don't. Maybe you're not a crier.I thought I wasn't a crier either, but as soon as Hazel talks about grenades, I lost it.It is a beautiful story of young love (which, I am usually not into AT ALL) and carrying on, living with more questions with answers, and finding the beauty in pain.Oh, man, just thinking about it makes me get misty-eyed.Definitely read it before seeing the movie, who knows what the movie will do to this story."
5," Having grown up in Indiana, I must admit that it was both amazing and nostalgic to read about places I had, up until last year, grown up in and around. The Fault In Our Stars deserves a five star rating because of the timeless thoughts and realities it forces upon us, how life can be cut short and how the families have to deal with it. I laughed, cried, and enjoyed this boom, and although I'm no professional when it comes to reviewing, but I know I will recommend this book to many, many people."
5," don't want to just say that I love The Fault in Our Stars because it's not enough. This book is different in how it makes me feel than almost any other novel I've ever read. It means something to me, reaches me on a different spectrum, and I will forever be grateful that I read it and got to experience it. I will say that Green is brilliant for this novel that didn't feel at all like a novel. I recommend it to anyone and everyone who is presently, or will later be, alive.*10/10*"
2," This is the best book I've ever read!!!  Of course, I've only read 3 books, and the main characters were a boy named Dick and a girl named Jane,  I'm only in the 3rd grade,  but Mr. Green's book is quite readable by my friends and classmates.  Once I get older and read more mature books, this may not be the greatest book I've ever read, and this review may be an embarrassment to me, but for right now it is the greatest book I've ever read, even better than Fun with Dick and Jane!!!"
5," loved it. Although it was at a lower level of reading for me (I'm 19) it had such a wonderful portrayal of the characters with a story line that makes you take a step back and look for the good in your life, rather than focus on the bad. Hazel was so easy to Identify with and Augustus is just someone people seem to dream about knowing. A wonderful book, I would definitely recommend. Thank you John Green for putting perspective in my life and helping me to be more appreciative f everything."
5," This is one of the best books I've ever read, by far John Green's best work. I highly reccomned giving this book to your mom, dad, sister, brother, grandma, grandpa, and aunt LouLou, because it a fantastic piece of literature that anyone with the capability to read and comprehend it will love.The story stays with you long after you've turned the final pages, and the characters are some of the most awe inspiring and interesting almost 3D characters you'll ever find in a book. A 5 star book."
5," was a sniveling mess by the time I finished. I absolutely loved it. I think that the moral and the lessons learned in this story are lessons I won't forget. I think this touched me more than it might have had I not been touched, through a family member, by cancer. This just goes to show that we are not immortal we are so devastatingly and breakable mortal. Not only was this a great inspiring  story, it was  a beautiful love story. I someday hope that I could have a love so pure as theirs."
5," The Fault in out Stars has become my favorite book of all time. From beginning to end its a book that tells the honest truth. This book it such an emotional roller coaster, that your brain might get confused. From laughing your butt off to sobbing your eyes out to laughing through the sobs, this book changes your life in some way, no matter how small. The story touched my heart, and with that, the only thing I have to say, is thank you John! Thank you so much for writing this piece of art!"
5," Augustus Waters is the type of boy that I want to fall in love with and that I would want my future daughter to fall in love with. He's metaphorical in a poetic, slightly pretentious in a way, but never rude, and it comes off endearing. His love for Hazel is simply beautiful, and the story is full of laughs, smiles, and tears. Like seriously, the further you get in the book, the more the feels on the bus go round and round, but I absolutely love it. This is the best book I have ever read."
5," Astounding, brilliant, true to life. This fascinating journey of teenagers in love sounds sappy as an overall theme, but this tale is one featuring the most captivating teens I've ever met on the page--and certainly in real life. Magnificent dialogue, amusing at times, often wrenching, every word original. This is one not to miss. Touted as a Young Adult novel, but everyone truly NEEDS to read this book. I keep thinking about these characters, over a week since I flipped to the last page."
5," This was a fantastic book. It is about Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters, two teens that meet at a cancer support group. What I liked most about this book was the writing. Hazel is such a vivid character and the writing really drew me in and made me feel like a part of her life. I became really attached to the characters and it was hard to finish, because I didn't want their story to end. I loved this book. It made me openly weep in public, though, and I didn't even care. It's a must read."
5, This book was amazing. I finished it in 2 days. I laughed I cryed and most of all I learned something. Love is something that everyone has. It doesn't matter if u r sick or healthy you have it and that every girl has there own hidden beauty. Over all I loved this book and there is not one part that I didn't like. If it was written a different way it wouldn't be a good book. That way I rate this book at 5 stars. I recommend this book to everybody that loves a sad but beautiful love story
5,"m 30 years old and this is one of the best books I've ever read.  The word that comes to mind while describing it is captivating I'm usually a pretty slow reader but I just couldn't put this book down.  I literally fell in love with the characters and laughed out loud as well as cried in public.  I can't how old you are, what gender you are ... you NEED to read this book.  I'm really looking forward to seeing the movie next month, but I doubt it will be as good as the book."
2," The Fault in Our Stars is an emotional book about cancer. The teenagers faced with the illness are brought to a young understanding about life and death. They make eloquent statements and have witty conversations that I have no trouble believing as I have spoken to very young cancer patients and have often been blown away by their keen understanding of mortality and the beauty and richness of life. It’s a hard painful book, both poignant and funny. It is well worth the box of tissues."
5," This book is one of the best books I have ever read. It is funny and beautifully written with deep thoughts laced with sadness and humor. The books imagery alone let's the reader imagine a whole new world. The funny thing is, I was told the end, and it didn't matter, because the book was so good. The pages express the cruel reality of life - and death - while remaining un-depressing enough to get capture the readers attention (though I must admit I was sobbing through the last pages)"
5," Loved this book. It was amazing from start to finish.  I am a weeper, so yes, I cried, but it was a good cry.  This book was so well written and it tugs at your heart strings in a way I never imagined.  Just went to see the movie on opening night and was so happy with the film adaption.  I absolutely loved the main characters and Gus' wittiness is on point and Hazel's attitude towards life, even with her situation, is inspiring.  A must read.  A book for all ages, even 30 year olds!"
5," Although I could write about this book forever, I'll keep it short. This book is incredible. Beautiful. Heart wrenching. And shows how things don't always go as expected, but love is love through thick and thin. I bawled my eyes out and have recommended this book to everyone I can. I DEFINITELY would say this is in my top 3 favorite books ever. John Green is brilliant and this book sticks to you for days after you read it. It's a beautiful story, and I think everyone should read it."
5," This was a book, that once I got into, I could not stop reading, hoping it would never end. I marked so many sentences as favorite quotes that this may just be my new favorite book. I'm 43 years old and enjoyed the young love, crying through Hazel's grief as I too have experienced similar loss.  I cried, I laughed, at times simultaneously. I give it 5 stars because it's only the 3rd book I've stayed awake all hours of the night because I couldn't stop myself from turning the pages."
5," had heard so many great things about this novel, and was  very nervous about reading it. I finally decided to read it, and let me tell you one of my best decisions. The story was not just about to cancer kids preparing to die. It is a heart wrenching novel about true love and how it can come in the craziest of times. This epic love story kept me engulfed from start to end. Once I finished I balled my eyes out! This beautiful love story was  by far the best book I have ever read!!"
5," You will be caught there in the words in the first paragraph and you will still haunt this book for days and weeks after you read it. You'll tell your friends about it. You will update your FB page with a quote from the passages you can't stop  thinking about. You will want to read every book by the brilliant John Green. You will observe Hazel and Augustus as a quiet spirit knowing you will have to leave them eventually, but hanging on to their dear lives long after the words stop."
5,"f you are looking for a humorous and heartfelt book, seriously get this! I'm going to have my daughter read it as well. Its such a great story, makes you laugh out loud, have tears in your eyes, but really makes you think about life as well. I dont give reviews that talk too much about a book, but dont read too many of the detailed reviews or you will find lots of spoilers.  John Green must be a special person to have done such a wonderful fictitious story so well."
5," have a no reading bad books policy, I put down books that don't deserve my time. I'm less than 100pgs into this one, and it has already earned completion, I can't remember the last time I felt that way.I grabbed this in a whim after seeing johns vlog post on the release.I only bought the hard cover because it was cheaper than kindle version. That makes no sense, I save money, and I can let someone else read it when I'm done. Why can't digital delivery be appropriately priced?"
5," When I seen the movie trailer I knew I wanted to see it, but was unaware there was a book. Deciding to read the book first with only a slight idea to what the storyline was I was blown away by the story that I read! I read a couple of books a week, but this was definitely one I could not, nor did not put down. It was heartbreakingly one of the best books I've ever read! I love the depth at thought and emotion that was in it! Probably the best book I've read or will read this year!"
2," This book was by far the best book I have ever read. John Green develops the characters to the point that they seem real. You gain a strong connection with each character, and you don't wamt to stop reading.(i was up until 2 am reading this) For anyone who plans on reading The Fault in Our Stars, be prepared, i have only cried twice while reading a book before this, and i was practically balling my eyes out at the end. I hope you enjoy, because it really is a great book!"
5," had high expectations as this book has been heralded as an amazing read.  It did not disappoint.  It's one of those stories that touches your very soul so be warned, there will definitely be tears.  However, John Green writes with such a unique fresh voice that you never want it to end.  It's void of sentamentality but manages to grip you and take you on a journey you will never forget.  It's honest, profound and most of all a fantastic read.  If I could give it 6 stars I would!"
5," gave this beautifully written story 5 stars because its one of those books that not only draws you in but gives you a feeling of complete admiration for the characters.  Its sad, funny, heart wrenching, but more about strength and the meaning of true first love. It made easy for me to have a connection because I have Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy and I too, sleep with a bi-pap machine and recently had to get a feeding tube.  I look forward to reading other books by John Green."
5," strongly believe that a book must feel real, whether it is about fighting demons and monsters or falling in love.  Green has written a book with characters who feel so real that I laughed out loud several times, smiled with the characters, and sobbed when they felt pain.  Then, I went back and immediately read it again.The best books are ones where you know the characters and you miss them as soon as the final page is turned.  John Green has written one of these 'best books.'"
5,", like Augustus Waters, take pleasure in looking at beautiful people.  I also, like Hazel Grace Lancaster, take pleasure in reading well-written books.  This extraordinary 313 page novel would fit both of their interests and more.I sobbed uncontrollably , I laughed, I lost myself completely to the book.It's such an amazing piece, so amazing that it deserves a 3:19AM review from a more than satisfied, tired, and devoted fan.This Novel and John Green certainly didn't FTBA."
5," laughed as much as I cried. So I'm sure my family thought I was going crazy from the constant mood swings. Towards the end I was so emotionally exhausted and invested all I wanted to do was go to bed right after I consumed a pint of Ben and Kerry's and destroyed a box of tissues. But I couldn't put it down. My book has the biggest crocodile tear marks all over the pages, I just couldn't control my emotions. It was a wonderful love story that will stand against the end of time."
5," A lovely story about the price of love and death. Every character in this story is believable. But the two main heroes here are truly wonderful, and all the more vibrant because they have found each other. Really quite a ride. I was surprised to find tears streaming down my face. And even more surprised, since I had stumbled upon this book quite by accident, to find that it is soon to be a movie. Can only hope the movie-makers do the book justice. Really, a lovely, lovely story."
5," This book was very different than anything I have ever read, but really good.  The writing is extraordinary and unbelievably clever.  You felt like you knew these characters personally.  I am a chick book reader and this was different for me.  The love story is hard to even comprehend, but a true love story.  Nothing  fluff about this.  It made me think about terminal illness and see it through their eyes and hearts.  I would recommend this to anyone to read."
5," read the copy belonging to my granddaugther. Highly recommended for all ages. Serious subject ( teens with terminal cancer) but funny and sharp as well as sad, and addresses some universal questions - the meaning of life, and whether there is oblivion at the end or something more; whether we should be aiming for the extraordinary, or whether an ordinary life lived well and with love is just as precious. And at the end of the book you will not want to say goodbye to those kids."
5," Thank God it finally arrived!  My 15-year old and her friends are all nuts about John Green and have been reading and talking about the book since it came out.  They have uploaded pictures of themselves opening the Amazon package which the author then wove together in a video montage, and they have forsaken homework and eating so that they can continue reading.  My daughter also insists on telling me the storyline at every opportunity. Apparently this author has the magic touch!"
2," The writing is horrific. Flowery, the sort of prose an English 101 student trying to show off a new vocabulary list tries to use.The characters are off-putting and unlikable, and the story, while somewhat interesting, is not enough to climb above the terrible prose. Sure, the subject matter is ambitious, but so is the subject matter of the average after school special, and with more success. I finish nearly every book I read no matter how awful, and I am still slogging through."
5,"m not typically a YA reader, but I absolutely loved John Green's The Fault in Our Stars. Yes, I was that blubbering woman who stayed up until midnight to finish the story. Excellent character development with heart-wrenching insights made this book hard to put down. As a early thirty-something, I could relate to the coming-of-age story, as well as, the parental perspective of having a child with cancer. Intimate, truthful journey that I thoroughly enjoyed. I highly recommend."
1," A friend recommended this book to me and quite honestly, I may never have read it otherwise. What a tragedy that would have been. The Fault in Our Stars is that book that touches your soul and stays with you until you die and then you die a little easier as you recall the words of Hazel and Augustus, who saw dying as a side effect of what they were made of versus this thing that hovered over their days, waiting to swoop down on them. Five stars is not enough to give this book."
5," have a tendency to read about two books a week and every book is my favorite until I read the next one, however; this book is by far the best book I have ever read. This will forever be in my top five, if not my number one. This book affected me in so many ways. I dreamt I was Hazel and my boyfriend was Augustus one night. I cried so much in the process of reading. I was absolutely, totally, completely enveloped by this book. It has been a privilege to experience this story."
5," Never in my life has a book made me cry. I cried for some time after finishing this book. My first John Green book, and it will not be my last. Beautiful writing and wonderful characters that you will fall in love with. You can tell a lot of love and effort went into this book. While the concept of the book is simple, the narration makes it a somewhat complex and a very intriguing story. It would be cheesy to say this book changed my outlook on life, but well... it really did."
5," You will cry, you will laugh, and you'll do everything in between. The Fault In Our Stars, is a book that will stay with you. You will always remember the love of Hazel and 'Gus. When I first heard about this book I was to busy to read it now,I just finished reading it (for the third time) and I still don't want it to end like it did. In my opinion is like An Apparel Affliction, it has no ending. Your left wondering what happened it Hazel. But over all it was an amazing book."
5," This is my new favorite book! It had me feeling everything at once, happy; sad; angry. Hazel and Gus both were very relatable for a young adult. And even though this isn't a cancer story it does tackle cancer and death it does so in a lighthearted manner, which allowed the reader to feel like it was okay to talk about cancer with those who have it. It was an AMAZING story that I read in one day. I couldn't pu it down. Words can't describe how much I loved this book!"
5," After losing several loved ones all st once in the past year, I feel I can relate to the message of how those left behind are affected. It is also eye opening to have an insight yo cancer and the mind of someone affected by it. This book is a total cry fest creator but is worth each and every tear shed at the truth gained from learning about the dying and those already gone. Thank you John Green for helping me to understand that a death doesn't mean that they were never here."
5," could tell you how much I loved this book, how I covered my mouth and shouted at just the right moments or how much it hurt when Augustus died. However, I can't do justice to the feelings I felt. All I can tell you is that being someone who reads a few books a week when left alone long enough, that this is the best book I have ever read, invoking emotion and thought just like a good book should.Read it. You'll love it.It's a good life, Hazel Grace."
5," liked this book not because I love the writing style of John green but because when I read what the book was about, it was on topics a lot of people don't like to talk about; cancer and death. It was written beautifully enough that we could walk in the footsteps of those who have had cancer but also give us room to imagine a greater story for them. The characters are lovable and unforgettable. Definitely going  on to being one of my fave books along with looking for Alaska!"
2," When I found out that my daughter was interested in reading this book I agreed to buy it for her. I also found out that she has summer reading for her freshman year. She promised me that she would read this book for fun and as one of her summer reading books. In one part of the book she started crying, so that made me happy because I knew she was actually trying to connect to the book. I am starting to read the book on a recommendation from my daughter. It is amazing so far."
5," The worst book and the best book ever. Words can't describe the beauty of this book. The scary thing is that it happens every day. This book should be more of a non-fiction. It was a beautiful dedication to Esther Earl, who had more of the fate of Augustus then Hazel. This ripped your heart out and tore it to shreds. It was wonderful and everyone should read it. I can honestly say I sobbed most of the way through it, and I loved it to as many pieces as it tore my heart into."
5," This was one of the best novels I have ever read. It makes you laugh, cry, and ponder about the things being said in the book. John Green really makes you think about your own life, and how you perceive it. The book itself is just an amazing read. No boring parts, and exciting all the way through. Don't turn it down because it's about cancer, trust me you won't regret it. The book leaves you feeling satisfied, and not sad at all. Definitely recommend this book to everyone!!!"
5," am not in love with this book, but I really liked it, and shall most definitely be rereading it at some point. What stood out for me was the usage of just the right amount of humour, and the fact that the author had treated his characters with respect. This is the most dignified set of teenagers I have come across on paper. The empathetic portrayal of the protagonists is also remarkable.It's a relatively light read, and will probably make for a great gift too."
5,"ll keep my review brief since much has been said about it already. This is my first John Green book and I it makes me want to read more of his work. The story is poignant and witty. I thoroughly enjoyed it, I was on a 17 hour flight and I was able to finish the whole thing in one flight. One thing that I thought was a little funny was how worldly the young characters are, which I like but it does seem a little unrealistic. However, it's still one of my favorite books now."
4," The characters come off a bit unbelievable at times (perhaps too sophisticated/calculated - mostly in dialogue), the antagonist (if you want to call a crotchety ole author that) is way, way over the top, and you know the ending pretty from the getgo (i.e., not the twists, but the sadness)...a small infinity of problems (and I wouldn't really call the last a problem, just a roadblock for some who prefer happy endings), but the larger infinity is pretty close to perfect."
4," probably shouldn't have read this book, a sibling has leukemia, and  it hit a bit close to home. However, it is incredibly well written and I enjoyed every page,  despite the tears. Don't dismiss this due to the young adult label, it traverses age. Loved it. Word of advice, don't read on a plane...or in public in general.  You just fall in love with Augustus Waters and Hazel Grace...thank you for this this little infinity.  This will be a hard back copy I keep forever."
5," This book was heart-touching. I just couldn't stop reading. I finished it in about four hours. I can relate it to the divergent trilogy, but then again I can't. At first it seems like a cancer story. It forms into a romance story, then molds its way into a comedy story in numerous roles. Next you find tragedy. Finally, a heart-touching, sweet last moment. I love how you can't label this book one thing. Its much more. Nice job, John Green. :) This I'd a lot coming from me."
5," think that I gave it five stars, a) because it deserves it and b) the writing is so memorial and excellent. It's bittersweet.The things that I dislike, was that it was really sad. But I'm not going to say any spoilers. And, there was a bit of intimacy, but I think the brilliance of the book altogether outdid these small little dislikeable qualities. I love this book, the romance, the humor, and even the bittersweet moments. I recommend it to probably teens and up."
5," Mr. Green's comedic writing is what drew me in. The main character is sarcastic and whitty, as are all of the characters the further you read. This story is about an unfortunate and sad situation and it really makes you appreciate your own life. Mr. Green has woven a story that's full of depth and honesty. One reason I like this book so much is because of how different the plot is and how different the characters are. You feel like you want to be friends with all of them."
2," Capturing the essence of a teenager's spirit is a skill few authors do well. Doing justice to one facing serious illness is even more rare. The Fault in Our Stars proves it can be done. Readers well past their young adult years will enjoy this read immensely. It would be a great read for parents and teens to share - and likely to spark a lot of conversation about the lives of the young characters, and their parents, as they struggle will the pain of devastating illness."
5," This book was hauntingly and devastatingly wonderful. It both damages and heals you simultaneously. It crushes and lifts. It inspires and confuses. And uses the power the power that all books hold in that it can always be talked about in the present tense. There is nothing to say about this book other than that it must be read. It doesn't just ask to be read: it absolutely demands to be read. So do yourself, your soul, your mind, and your loved ones a favor, and read it."
5," This book was amazing definitely would recommend it to people.  Careful it's a tear jerker!  The thing I loved the most about this book was that it wasn't one of those typical love stories where they meet fall in love and then live happily ever, because that doesn't always happen.  This book had a realist take on life and while you still get your love story it also incorporates that yeah you can fall in love but life is still going to happen, but you can get through it!"
5," read this whole book In a day and a half.. call it nerdy, but I couldn't put it down, and with good reason. It's easily the most real and well written book I have ever read. It pulls on your heart strings and makes you really think about how you want to go about living your life. I laughed, I cried, I ached , and I was both happy and sad right there along with the characters of The Fault in Our Stars. I highly recommend it and will re read this book many more times."
5," can easily say I read this whole book in one sitting. It's just that good. I wish there were more people in this world who had this different outlook on life a the universe. I am completely attached to this book and the characters will always be remembered by me. This book phenomenal. Gus and Hazel showed me true love, loving people even with their fatal flaws. I could probably go on for days about this book.My thoughts are stars I cannot fathom into constellations."
5, There is nothing that I did not like about this book. It had drama with a pinch of humor which is a very nice combination. John green is an outstanding writer and I now understand why this book has gone viral. It teaches many lesson and shows you different sides of life. This book has a very deep meaning but yet is easy to understand. I am looking forward to reading and seeing more of John Green.Ps. Check out the song The Fault in Our Stars by Troye Sivan
5," Quite exceptional, I must stay. The Fault In Our Stars is a tender, heartwarming, and at times, tragic tale of growing up and first love.The story of Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters will instantly captivate you on first encounter, and leave you heartbroken in the closing chapters.A young adult novel that is not exclusive to the young. You won't want to put it down, and much like An Imperial Affliction, you'll eagerly anticipate what comes next."
5," This book broke my heart. I stayed up late to finish it because I just had to know what happened. The teenagers in this book have been through SO much and the sense of humor they continue to hang on to is amazing. Even knowing what kind of destiny awaits them. I wasn't a huge fan of the novel within a novel aspect. I never usually like that, but it didnt take anything away from this beautiful story. Im pretty sure this was my first John Green book. It wont be my last."
5," read this novel in less than four hours- I was so intrigued by the characters and their plight. A story that's devastating and disturbing as much as it is charming.  To understand the perspectives of the characters families as they struggle together thru such horrible situations, is frightening. What a beautiful love story in an ugly setting. I recommend this book, however I would also recommend you have your tissues ready as you will experience a range of emotions."
5," such a great book. really kept my attention the whole time, i didn't want to put it down. i do wish i knew what was going to happen at the end to hazel grace. i'm going to assume cancer finally took it's toll on her since she has a eulogy for her, however i feel like the ending of this book is similar to the ending of the imperial affliction book that is so frequently recognized throughout the novel. great story, sad, but great story. the movie was fantastic as well."
2," The book is very good, I love John Green's writing. It's not cheesy, it's casual, very touching and genuinely interesting.I have a hardback book in a dust cover. I don't like the dust covers at all, I just don't get the idea. If the dust cover eventually becomes dirty or torn, I'll just have a black hardback book without any drawing on it.I'd recommend this book to teenagers and adults if they don't mind reading about 16-year-old protagonists."
5," This story is quite exceptional. It's heart-breaking and heart-warming(real life heartbreaking). The writing was excellent, although some of the vocabulary was over my head (sad to admit but true), this book made me cry and it made me laugh. I loved the wit between Hazel and Gus, quite smart for their age. Gus showed true courage and I really appreciated the way he handled the crappy things that life handed him. This is definitely an encouraging book and a must read!"
5," For the first 70% of this book, I was so refreshed by the wit and sarcasm that I couldn't wait to get home to read it. We say LOL so frequently, and yet how often do we really do it? Well for me, it was 70% of the time I read this book. But I knew the last 30% was coming. I knew the tears would come, and the good byes would be made, and I knew I would have to keep going. And just like Hazel Grace and Gus would say about their love...it was so, so worth it."
5," This book is not only for the young set. There is great benefit to all who read this. It's not only about two teens battling cancer; it's about a lesson to all of us to live our lives every day, every minute. We should be thankful for this time especially if we are lucky enough to find love and be capable of giving. This story is beautiful, funny, heartbreaking and poignant. Gus and Hazel made me laugh, cry, laugh all over again, and cry yet again. I'm still crying!"
5," This book is a definite tear jerker. I read most of your typical teen romance novels and was quite surprised at how different it was. I wasn't quite sure how but then I hit me... this book is different because of how deep it is. The concepts, thoughts, questions, and scenarios are very deep and force the reader to contemplate what is life, happiness, love (etc.) Overall I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys deep themed literature and bittersweet stories."
5," When you start reading, everything seems kind of nihilistic and gritty. Hazel is a bitter person waiting to die. The twist at the end is: she's still alive and not leaving scars. Augustus makes her beautiful to the reader and Gus is the catalyst for change in her life even if her lungs suck at being lungs. John Green's writing is epically impact full and dare I say ridiculously quotable? I highly recommend reading this book and doing so with a highlighter on hand."
4," A perfect blend of laugh and sadness, a well-written plot, so definitely five stars. Personally, I was intrigued by the book because I wanted to feel how terribly hard life can be in these teenagers' lives. I wish Gus hadn't died, but that reminds me that this story can tell a lot about how life actually is for some people. Eventually, what makes this book amazing is this: love is what saves the characters from dying without being remembered. Well done John Green."
5," This book will make you cry. I'm not even going to lie about that. But it is so deeply moving . The way it is written is from a unique (and hilarious) perspective. The philosophy and thoughtfulness of the characters will keep you reading until the end, even though the end is slightly predictable. BUT. this book is by no means boring and it is worth every penny. You will definitely be reminded to appreciate everything about your life and the world that you inhabit."
5," This book is described as Young Adult Fiction, but I felt it could appeal to any reader, old or young. The storty is beautifully written, and as you fall in love with the 16 year old characters, it breaks your heart to come to know them and the beauty of the love they share with each other, and with their families. They have a lot to teach us all about what it is like to persevere through the hardships of cancer, and still find joy. I highly recommend this novel!"
5," This book is so amazing!!!! It's John Green's best book!!! It's is the only book that successfully got me to cry (and that takes a lot) I say that anyone should read it if you're over 12. I got this book about 3 months ago an dive read it 4 times!!! No other book can top it. Read it if you like romance novels!!! I would give it a million stars if I could!!! It annoyed me when she recites some poetry, but it doesn't happen that often. READ IT!!!!!!!! YOU MUST!!!!!"
2," My son is a cancer survivor. He wanted me to read this book I guess so I could understand feelings that he was experiencing but could not express.  He also mentioned how he was treated by his peers during his treatment and how far removed her felt from them.  He is telling me something through this book. I love that he trusted me with such an amazing book. Now I like Hazel, want to know more. What HAPPENS WITH HAZEL?  does she live or does she join Gus in heaven."
5," By default, a book by John Green will be intelligent, witty, humorous and thought-provoking. But this book was so much more than that. It was the book I always needed but never knew I was missing. It filled holes inside of me that I didn't know I had. It was equal parts heart-breaking and hilarious. I can do nothing but be thankful that John is in existence, albeit temporarily, and thinking and feeling and creating.I recommend this book to absolutely everyone."
5," have seen this movie and read this book a million times....Not with the same title, but the same story line. A good book leaves you wanting more, this book left me wanting to rewrite it. what a waste of money to make  movie out of it....  This book is highly overrated and poorly written... Not even a good love scene. I felt like I was reading somebody's short story for freshmen creative writing. The characters lives were so unrealistic. I'm disappointed."
5," This book is absolutely wonderful. I LOVE IT! Some parts of it were sad and others happy, but I couldn't stop reading! This book is the first book I have ever read that has actually made me cry. The thing was I wasn't just crying for what happened in the book but for what happened to the people in the book. There were many parts where I just couldn't breathe because I had read what had just happened! I loved this book and would recommend it to anybody who reads!"
2," As it's a book with great character development, a great plot, and dealing with mental/bodily illnesses without romanticizing them, it has made it to my list of favorite books. This was the first John Green Book I had read(I've now also read Looking for Alaska, Paper Towns, and i will soon read An Abundance of Katherines), and I was not disappointed, especially since my book came signed when it was not supposed to!If you are thinking about reading it, DO!"
5," read this is a matter of hours, and it was amazing. I could not put it down. It was definitely a tearjerker. I read it in an airport too, so I got quite a few stares. Hazel is such a relatable character and so determined. Her relationship with Augustus was beautiful to read about, I could feel their love. The book was amazing, and I am very glad it did not end like Hazel's favorite book, An Imperial Affliction. The book definitely deserved a five out of five."
5," rated this a 5 star because it is an outstanding read!  It combines humor with a love story with sad events along the way!  The characters are excellently developed and portrayed and it will tug at your heart strings.  Well read young readers (the book targets this group) will like it and I am really a lot older and I loved the book!  This author, John Green, has a wonderful style.  I am glad he is young so he has a lot of time to write more wonderful books."
5," This book quickly became one of my favorites and something that I'll probably continue to read over and over. I love the author's writing style and how he accurately portrayed the feelings of someone watching their loved ones die of cancer. I have nothing bad to say about this book. I really wasn't expecting to like this book as much as I did, mostly because I'm not that interested in serious books. However, I enjoyed this one thoroughly and even cried a bit."
5," read the whole thing in a day. This is high praise from me being that I have dyslexia and read kinda slowly.It was touching and I haven't cried this much since reading the final Harry Potter book. It's beautifully written and I fell in love with the characters, they feel so real and wonderful.I knew John Green was awesome from watching youtube but I think now he is my hero. He has inspired me to read and write more for sure.DFTBA!!! &lt;3 &lt;3"
5," At first this book was a little confusing. Not the plot, but all the letters. I admitt, I didn't really read them... It got better, though. I read this book because a friend recommended it to me a long time ago. She read it, and cried. Her mom read it, and cried. I read it, and hysterically sobbed for what seemed like an hour.  This is the only book that has caused me to shed more than a few tears.If you like sad\happy books, I recommend you read this."
2," John Green may be a genius. Scratch that, he IS a genius. Never has an author been able to pack so much into one novel, you'll be laughing one second and then in tears the next. I think that this is to par with his first and in my opinion best novel (based off true events) Looking for Alaska. For those of us who are aware of the events of Esther Earl, this will bring back memories of the lost but not forgotten beloved Nerdfighter.This star will not go out."
5, Well I cried beautiful tears for these beautiful characters. It was a sad story but there would have been more loss had the events and emotions not have played out the way they did. Like they say (it's better to have lived and loved then to never have loved at all). All of these characters will continue to plague my mind and heart from this day forth. It will definitely be a reread for me and now I will be heading to the movies this week to watch the movie.
5, One of the BEST books I have ever read.  What I love about The Fault in Our Stars is that it is so much more than a typical novel on life and love.  It brings great meaning to life's great purpose and discusses the difficult topic of death and hardship with ease.  It's an absolutely beautifully written book.  I have never read a book more than once and I have already begun reading it again! You will not regret the experience of reading this wonderful book!
5, This YA book is a wonderful read!  The characters are richly drawn....I cared deeply what happened to them....and the story line is beautiful and uplifting....an absolutely fantastic book!  I was very sad when I got to the end....and I'll be re-reading it again soon.  I really miss the characters!  Their outlook on life...their insight...and their very sharp wit....all things I'll be missing!!  Can't recommend this book enough....it's very special indeed!
5," This book was amazing!! It was intellectually stimulating and the storyline was captivating. I'm a nurse so it was nice to understand the references and to get a glimpse of the life of teenage cancer patients. Illness does not define you as a person so it's admirable when people struggle with sickness and can find humor in it, that's living! I highly suggest reading this book...it struck a variety of emotions for me and it will resonate with you as well=)"
5," love young adult lit and The Fault in Our Stars ranks right up there with The Book Thief on my all-time favorites list. It is not only beautifully written, but it makes you care about its young characters and their long-suffering families. Hazel, the narrator, lives on the edge of death and although she talks about giving in to her chronic disease, you know she'll keep fighting. This isn't Rocky. This is real life in the world of Cancer kids."
5," managed to get a hold of my Signed Copy of John's book last night when I came home from university. 8pm - start to read. 1am - laughing and crying like a fool as I read the last page. This book is not near to genius, like that nice man from the New York Times said. This book has completely surpassed genius. Anyone that knows how to read should buy this book. And anyone that doesn't know how to read - go make some literate friends or buy the audio book."
5," knew i would cry when i read this. but i had no idea how loudly i would weep.john green is a rare and talented poet. he makes every word in this book matter. he has a way of explaining things using little words--but big imagery.reading this book, is like drinking a glass of champagne--a glass full of stars. my only warning, read it with a box of tissues.you will laugh. you will cry. then you will cry some more. and days later,  you may cry again."
5," The Fault in Our Stars is a quick, easy read and quite humorous for such a weighty subject.  Knowing this would not come to a good end did not darken these young people's stories but rather showed triumph of spirit over a deadly adversary.  Telling the story in the first person from the girl's perspective really kept me engaged as events unfolded.  Well worth reading and these characters stay with you.  Now I want to see how well it was adapted to film."
5," couldn't put it down. Death spares no one, but some live with death hovering relentlessly over them until their last breath. The reality of the side effects of illness and impending death are honestly, hilariously and bluntly expressed by Hazel and Augustus. Their experience will change your view of your own fragile state, have you ponder your own beliefs of an afterlife and of how you're living as you slowly, daily die.Highly recommended."
2,"f you are a fan of John Green, you will love this book. If you aren't, don't let some of the more negative reviews discourage you. While the main characters aren't traditional teenagers, they weren't meant to be, as they are written as teenage cancer patients who has their whole lives change due to the disease. It is incredibly funny, but serious when it needs to be. You are almost guaranteed to make an emotional connection to the characters as well."
5," simply can't fathom the love i have for this book. You'll cry your eyes out, laugh till your lungs hurt, and no matter where you are and who your with you just won't be able to put it down. It shows you life death and everything inbetween. I highly recommend you purchase a tissue box along with the book. It makes you realize that theres hope for your terrible love life.(maybe that's only me) Green you've done it again. I can't wait for the next novel."
5," loved this book. I read it all in 5 hours as soon as the package came. The writing is beautiful, the story is heartbreaking. I just loved it. My favorite book of the year by far (and I have been reluctant int the past to change my favorite book from Harry Potter. That's how good it is!). I would recommend this book to anyone who doesn't mind mild language and content, but really I got past that and it was wonderful!Best wishes!DFTBA!"
5,"m very cautious when it comes to reading about cancer...the topic seems exploited, especially when it comes to teenagers. This book, however, was beautifully written.  There was no hero  or overly optimistic patient or parents breaking down. The writing is raw, emotional and actually funny. It reminds you that if you take the cancer away, these are still just teenagers, kids even, trying to find themselves. I would recommend it to everyone."
5," was given 6 options for summer reading this year, one of those options was this book. I and all of my girl friends decided to read this one. this book was very inspirational and believable. it captures the story of two teenagers who are cursed with cancer at fairly young ages. it follows them through thier lives and really shows how it is like to grow up fightimg cancer. The Fault in Our Stars is well worth reading for any teenager, especially girls."
5," Despite the huge success and great reviews of this book I resisted reading it as I read for pleasure and don't consider cancer, particularly cancer in children, as a subject of transformative interest. While never trivializing the seriousness of this devastating illness the book gave cancer somewhat of a backseat to the fact that people can still live while they are dying. This wasn't a happy book but it was a hopeful one, an enjoyable story well told."
5," A touching, in-your-face story about young people who have cancer and courageously carry on living their lives. Hazel, Augustus and Isaac cope w horrendous treatments, stare death in the face and contemplate the meaning of their lives... All the while cracking up readers with their humor, wit and sharing their teenage angst. A well written story, great character development, and lots of twists and turns just like life. I'm looking forward to the movie."
5," This book has been out for less than a week and there are already over 160 5-star reviews for it.  I think that says a lot, don't you?  This book affected me like few others have - I laughed through my tears at parts, and fell in love right along with the characters.  I bought it in the morning, finished it by night, and then spent the rest of the evening emailing everyone I know who loves to read, to buy this book.Buy it.  You won't be disappointed."
5," This book is unlike any other I have read. It's insightful, intelligent, and purely John Green. Being a 15 year old teenager, I mostly stick with young adult novels. I can never really connect with most teen Novel's however, but this book...It was the most wonderful thing I've ever read. The characters are believable, and have flaws. Which I absolutely love. Hazel and Augustus are truly one of a kind characters. I'm absolutely in love this book."
5,ve never been a big fan of reading. Before this book I had only read one other book voluntarily which was the hunger games series and loved it. A good friend of mine recommended this book to me but I never thought much about it because like I said I'm not a huge fan of reading but this was such an amazing story! I couldn't put in down finished it in two days and it was absolutely amazing! Defiantly worth the money I highly recommend it to everyone.
2," This book is a beautiful, thought-provoking, read. It feels so organic, so pure and spontaneous, and yet, so well placed. This novel puts things into perspective for me, as a reader, as well as takes me on a journey of star-crossed lovers and their turns of fate. The first read-through made me laugh, cry, and then continue to cry, even afterwards, because the connection to the characters is so real. John Green has truly outdone himself. Once again."
5," Such a greatly written book, the best love story of this decade, it makes you feel happy and after some pages makes you cry. It is a beautiful love story that we be remembered for years! I suggest this book for everyone! I chose to give it five stars because it is an amazing book that i will never forget, i have never felt such intense emotions by reading a book. John Green is just the best! some infinities are bigger than other infinities"
5," Well written novel, very poignant and accessible. In my opinion the author captures the complicated emotions of life, and writes them without being overly dramatic or dismissive. I'm not usually a fan of love stories, because so many are written poorly, but Mr. Green does this one excellent service. Be warned, tissues needed throughout, and probably best not to read on public transportation if you don't feel comfortable crying in front of strangers."
5," A story of sacrifice, love, pain and joy. This book though seemingly for Young Adults is as entertaining for adults. The author uses language and metaphors that leave you captivated. The characters come alive so effortlessly with John Green that you can nearly touch and feel them like in a movie.Though the book is beautiful the plot is a love story between two cancer patients and book leaves you with an immense sadness and fear of the disease."
5," This book doesn't make me understand what it's like to have cancer. But it does make me understand that I will never know what it's like to have cancer. And believe it or not, this knowledge, along with innumerable other parts of this story, has provided me with insight that I formerly did not have; of life and of the universe. Read the book, then reread this review, and find its meaning. And remember, what may look like a pipe is not always a pipe."
5," Started last night... finished early this morning.The characters will stay with me for a long time.I'm a middle-aged mom of two and thought a lot of this book from the mom's perspective.  I just can't imagine and hope I never have to.It was a beautiful book and took me back to being 16 and so in love you thought you would explode.  To feel that sort of love, but know that there is no future for it... John Green captured these emotions so well."
5," The characters in this book are smart and lovable teenagers. For that reason I found it slightly unrealistic, but it is a truly wonderful read nonetheless. The topics are cancer and love, and at times the story is quite sad, but it is more often tongue-in-cheek and delightfully sarcastic (it is narrated by a teenage girl). Highly recommended for adults and young adults. You'll probably learn some new vocabulary from these teens, such as 'hamartia.'"
5," This book is deep, but not maudlin. There is no over the top emotionality that distracts from the real, intense emotion of the characters and their story. The characters approach their situations with the humor and anger and joy and helplessness those of us familiar with the side effect of death called cancer know all too well.More than a coming of age or epic personal journey, Hazel and Augustus' story is a slice of life: real and raw."
5," read this book within 24 hours. It's beautifully written and I especially liked the way the protagonists were able to voice their opinions on life, love and death so intelligibly. It's hard to not feel empathy for them and I cried and laughed with them. It is true what critics say that John Green writes for youth, not to youth. He helps them to form a voice. John Green manages to give us a silver lining on an otherwise depressing topic; cancer."
5," A friend recommended the book, and at first I thought it would be boring, but when I downloaded this book a day ago, I had no clue what was going to take place. Ever since then, I have been reading all night and sneaking it at the table so I wouldn't have to stop reading. When I did finish, I felt like turning back to the beginning and going through that whole journey again. And for anyone who is about to read this book, keep the Kleenex near you."
2," guess technically I should finish this book before reviewing it, but it is great and wonderful and beautiful. I have about 80 pages left (which won't take long at all). I love John Green's eloquence in writing this book. He insured that it is philosophical yet light-hearted, romantic yet not too sappy, and most importantly, it is quite funny. Thank you, John Green, for being among my favorite authors; I hope to read more from you in the future."
5," While book seemed to start out a little slow, it picked up the pace very quickly and held my attention to the very end...now...there needs to be a sequel. As a survivor myself, I could relate to the characters and I would definitely recommend this book to teenagers who have been afflicted with or knows some with cancer. A powerful book that makes you want to look twice at what life as to offer so as to make and leave your own mark in the world..."
5," Although the storyline is a tragic one, the author handles it with loving care and infuses young hearts with genuine feelings that affirm not all young love is puppy love. The main characters are well developed and their actions and reactions revolve around wisdom beyond their years.  Often victims living with their limitations and challenges at such a young age must grow up fast and the author showed these young people up for the task."
5, rated the book because it was very absorbing I cared about the characters. I loved their intelligence it also made me understand  the way the youth of today looks at  death. I'm sure not all but  it appeals to a number of young people. It opened dialogue with myself and my granddaughter who is a teenager. Which again is a good book to me. Any time you can talk about your feelings and your views across age barriers it is a good book.
5," hadn't heard of this book until I had seen that it was going to be released as a movie this summer.  I love reading books prior rt movies being made so though I would give this one a shot.  VERY WELL WORTH IT! I read it so quick that I want to go back and reread it.  IF you do read this book, go to the authors website, and read the question and answers from the author.  It gave me a more in depth look at the symbolism (I missed the water one)."
5," This book is so well written. The characters are believable, both the kids and the adults. The book wouldn't have been so heartbreaking if you didn't buy into their separate lives. The author character living in Amsterdam was a pretty convenient villain, but I think it shows how the death of one very close to you can take almost any toll.Is there a happy ending or does life just move on? A little bit of both, I think.Okay?Okay."
5,"m trying so hard to find the words to describe this beautiful piece of literature. I did all the cliché things one does when they read a spectacular book. I laughed, I cried, and I cried some more. I can easily say this is the greatest book I have ever read. I devoured this story in less than four hours flat well into the early hours of morning. Thank you so much John green for this ridiculously incredible story! Everyone MUST READ THIS BOOK!!"
5," expected it to take a week or so for the book to arrive but it literally took two days. I fell in love with the book after reading it for just ten minutes and didn't stop reading it until i was finished. so let's just say i was up until 3am reading it. it is a very very wonderful book, but it is a tear jerker. out of all the books i have ever read, this is the only one i have ever cried while reading. I have had my fair share of sad books too."
5," usually read fictional stories about things that could never happen. A friend suggested this book and I bought it but let it sit on my kindle for months without even opening it, letting the fictional paranormal romances fill my reading time instead. I was needing something to read while out of town and didn't have Internet access so I started this one. It is by far better than any of the other books I've read...it means something. I loved it."
5," John Green' s ability to wrap the readers heart and head into a knotted mess is unfathomable.When I first decided to read this book, I was sure it was going to be mushy, with haphazard thought patterns and broken teenage speech. But it was more than that. It was intelligent, vibrant, beautiful. Definitely a book you'll want to read forever. Until the end when you're going to need to put it down and breathe before having another go at it."
2," A book about teenagers with terminal cancer ought to be sad, a tearjerker, and this one is. But it's no sentimental play on emotions. Green has sculpted wry, sharp, insightful main characters whose depth of love and intellect make you cheer for them as much as they make you pity the poor, hapless adults who orbit their lives. I will read this book again. And when I die, I can only hope someone writes me as beautiful a eulogy as Augustus Green."
5," seldom write reviews, but I just HAD to recommend this book.  We just finished reading it for book club, and everyone loved it.  It is the best book we have read.  It is the best book I have read in a very long time.  I liked it so well that I bought all of Green's other books and read them immediately.  Ahhhhh!  Now what will I read?  Good stuff.  I wish I could write something 1% that good.  I just can't stop thinking about the characters."
5," This is possibly the best book I have ever read! The way he worded things was so amazing and beautiful. Even though I cried fir the last twenty percent of this book it was worth it! I will forever recommend this to anyone. Augustus was a beautiful human being with a great sense of humor, and Hazel was just the perfect character to be with him. I love this book, but I should warn you, you will cry for hours-days-weeks (yeah it's that sad-good)."
5," Well, we all know what happens. You might cry your eyes out, curse the author, curse cancer, throw your book across the room and fall upon your bed in a heap of emotional turmoil...but nonetheless you'll pick it back up after while and finish reading. My heart was torn to shreds, but even in the midst of wallowing in my novel-inspired despair, it is a great read! I guess it's worth the anger and sadness. In the meantime: John Green, you jerk!"
5," think this book is such a good read. Yes, the kids/teenagers have cancer, but they do not allow the disease to dominate their lives. The book illustrates how cancer patients view others looking at them and how they view dying. This book would possibly be good in helping someone cope with a dying loved one. Some of the quotes are excellent. I am not telling the story - no one needs spoilers. Buy it and enjoy it. I promise you will thank me!"
5," Firstly I must say I have just finished this amazing book and I am balling like a little girl! But the good kind of tears, the tears where you know you have just finished something to be remembered. I'm in love with this story, it's everything I expect with so much more. If your on the fence about shelling out money to buy it DON'T be. it's worth your time I swear. Hell, it's 3am and I have to wake in 3 hours but I just couldn't put it down."
5," loved the book. It made me laugh, worry and cry. A roller coaster of feelings that once i started reading i couldn't put it down until the end... and it was so inspiring that I had to read it again...Hazel and August, the main characters of this love story, are teenagers so real that I think any kid could relate to.I haven't read any other book of John Green, but now I want to read them all. I hope they are as good as this one."
5, thought this book was terrible! If the author had spent any time around teenagers he would have realized they do not talk like this.  The book felt forced; trying to provoke sadness from characters I actually cared nothing about.  The plot about the author was silly and made the story even less believable. Two terminally ill teenagers flying across the Atlantic to visit an author? Absurd! I will not be seeing the movie after reading this.
5," Formulaic romance plot enriched with smartass dialogue. I read this book before the movie came out, and I could tell this was written for the purpose of being made into a movie. The girl reminds me of a more sentimental, less smart, and very sick version of Juno. But in the fictional world, being teenage and having cancer and being teenage and pregnant hold equal weight as debilitating life events. I would much rather just watch Juno again."
5, don't usually read romances and ultimately thats what this book is.  However the characters were so engaging and the writing so dynamic I didn't mind.  The book is actually quite a page turner.  I would have rated it much higher if it hadn't been for the ending which seemed over worked.  Perhaps it was meant to be a twist but felt drawn out and convoluted compared to the rest of the book.  The writing is fabulous.  I'd still recommend it.
2, 'THE FAULT IN OUR STARS' is by far on  of my favorite books. It's made me look at things a total different way and accept &amp; be grateful for all that I have and love the ones who love me unconditionally. I can't deny that I won't ever read this book again because  that is not true. there is honestly no better way I would wan this book to end. Thank you for the opportunity to fall in love with a new peace of art John Green. - Jade Norah Curry
4," Weird, but having both of my parents die of cancer, draws me to stories such as this one. Loved the perspective of teens. On the same note, he 4 stars comes from the fact that these are two teens you don't usually run into, so some of the things are over the top for modern day kiddos, but perfect for a Soap Opera I might add! But loved the story none the less. It was such a great combination of heart string tugging, yet barrels of laughter."
5," This is about dying children. But what are we, all of us, but those about to die? This book will open your eyes to what it means to be alive, and what it costs. Doesn't matter if you're not a child and are not yet overtly dying. If you are human, you are dying. And you are alive. All at once. If you're in a moment in time where these thoughts make you cringe and want to shriek, read this book. If you're not in such a moment, read this book."
4," Probably the best book I've ever read in my life... No other has ever topped this. I will definitely continue reading John Greene's books... but this... You never grow out of it. I want to find a guy like Gus and be so much like Hazel... this is another one of those books where you wish it was you in the position of the main character... I know she will die, and like Peter Van Houten's, An Imperial Affliction, I can already see an ending..."
5," love this book. I have read it three times and will probably read it a million more. John Green is so talented and I look forward to more of his books. This one is a real tear jerker, especially for someone who has lost a loved one to cancer, like me. I would recommend this book to anyone with the ability to read. Don't let the sadness of the whole picture take away your chance to get to know some truly beautiful and humorous characters."
5," loved this book so very much. It is a true romance, young love, love of life, love of family. I wasn't emotionally prepared for this incredibly moving story but I never once regretted shedding a tear in public for Hazel, Augustus or Isaac. This book made me value the relationships I have and urged me to let those that I love know just how much. Very rare these days to read a book that has made such an impact on my life. I hope you enjoy."
5," Oh my God. Ohmygodohmygodohmygod. What a powerfully, beautifully, devastatingly well-written story. For the last sixty pages-- who makes a book turn achingly sad for sixty long pages and keeps you reading?-- I soaked through eight kleenexes, each time angrily pulling another reluctantly from the box, SWEARING it would be my very last tissue, that I couldn't possibly need one more. I want to know Augustus and Hazel in some sort of lifetime."
5,"t's beautiful! It's beautiful. I was assigned this book for a college class and, not being particularly excited to do homework, I begrudgingly started it this morning. It was perfect. I smiled and sobbed at various places throughout the story, and though it was sad and tragic and I could tell from the very start, I loved it. John Green is my new favorite author. He writes beautifully, and I will definitely be purchasing more of his books."
5," As a cancer patient, green unbelievable job describing some things that go through a person's head when fighting the disease. And i'm also a widow after having lost my husband to the same disease. Greens description of the emptiness and pain involved in all of it was unbelievably accurate.  He must have some first-hand knowledge of it himself to be able to describe the feelings like he did in this book. Laughter through tears. I loved it."
5," John Green has brought the reality of living and dying to the page with such intelligence, wit and kindness that I couldn't put this  book down.  With remarkable character development and story telling skills, he lets you into the hearts and minds of two young people who are ordinary teens but amazing people. Any age would like The Fault In Our Stars, especially if you have a family member suffering from cancer or another serious illness."
2," Absolutely iconic. The story makes you fall in love with the characters without ever feeling like its dragging. It's endlessly quotable, but perhaps the most significant feature of the novel is how even though most of us have never and will never be in a similar situation, it's relatable on a fundamental level. That fact, combined with the sheer publicity around the book's release, makes it a must-read in modern literature, in my opinion."
5," Honestly, reading the synopsis I really didn't expect much out of this book.  I've heard rave reviews about it though, so I thought I would give it a shot.I'm glad I did I read this.  I had the hardest time in the world holding down my tears.  I'm not one to cry but if this book doesn't bring you to the brink of tears at the least, you're reading it wrong.Great Character Development, Intelligent Writing, Nice Plot."
5," don't even now how to start this off so let me say this is amazing. I instantly fell in love with each of these characters. They all seemed human, and even though most of them had there own problems they didn't let it dictate there lives. And the writing made me laugh so much my family thought I was on pills. And cry so hard they thought I was bipolar.  Just please for the love of all things good read this book. It will not disappoint."
5," This book had everything! I finished it in three days, partly because the movie is coming out this week and I wanted to be able to compare it. i Loved Augustus character, and the conversational banter between the two young people was entertaining. I admired her mother's handling of the situation and  i can relate since my daughter died about two years ago. The descriptions of Holland were a delight.  I must find another John Green book!"
5, This is a beautiful book.  I am caught in the wave of excitement surrounding the release but think I would have loved this book if I'd pulled it randomly from the YA shelf at the library.There is so much about the universe that is just not fair (insert stomping feet) and it's not easy to talk about those parts of life.  The story unfolds and enfolds you and at the end you have a few more words to wrestle with the unfairness of it all.
4," selected this story because I like to see what young people are reading.  For some reason, it seems that young people are a bellwether for our culture, and it's just fun to see what they like to read, or should I say what young women like to read because it just seems that young men no longer read.In any event, I was deeply moved by this story and at times, I had to out it down in order to avoid crying in public.Dey"
5," She LOVES this book, and I wanted to love it too. I wanted to share a good cry with her by the end. NOPE.The dialogue WAS contrived. It did NOT sound like teenagers talking. Every plot point was very, VERY convenient, including the late-in-the-book news about Augustus.Every point that people have made in critical reviews I agree with. I just needed to vent as to what I REALLY felt about it.Sorry, Em."
5,"s hard to say how much we waste our days without taking them for granted. We are always so ungrateful of what the universe gives us everyday. This book had made this ice cold heart of mine brake in to tears. The book has these young fighters of life fighting constantly not to died they learn how to love and appreciate  life to the fullest, they learn what love is in such a small period of time and they teach others about the universe."
2, This Book is so good. The book is simply about two teenagers falling in love with each other while living and each dealing with a terminal illness close to everyone in one way or another : cancer! They have many journeys and different views on life. The book relates to many people as everyone knows someone who has or had to deal with cancer. Everyone should read this tear jerking novel which is also heart warming and funny all in one:)
5," had seen many commercials on TV about the movie, so this peaked my interest in the book.  I purchased it and started reading.  It took me several attempts to really get into the book and it did improve.  However, I was disappointed in the overall book.  To me it just didn't really get into the characters.  I think the same story could have been written in about a 10 page paper.  I wasn't really impressed with the writer or the book."
2,"v just finished reading the  fault in our stars.  read it in a day actually because i could not put it down, and i wanted to read it before i saw the movie.  I'm a mother of a soon to be 6 year old.  I thought this book was one of the most amazing pieces of literature i have ever read... and it was beautiful.  movies never do justice to books so I'm very happy to have read the book first. one of the most wonderful books iv ever read"
2, This book was amazing. I cried.... a lot!!!!!! For me being a teen myself I know for a fact regular teenagers do not talk like the teenagers in this book. Other than that fact this book was awesome!! It was truly a great love story. I would not recommend this book to anyone the age 12 and younger. There is a lot of foul lauguage and big complicated words. This is a beautiful book and I look forward to reading more books by John Green.
5, chose 5 stars because this is a book that I couldn't put down I loved everything about it.  The characters were believable and I was right into their lives.  I am definitely going to read more books by John Green.  I would love to talk about this wonderful book more but I don't want to give anything away - I want readers to go into this book like I did with no knowledge except it had been recommended to me to read.Enjoy!
5," Honestly, I don't even know what to say about this book. I just had to write a review saying that there is no reason not to read it. There's a line in the book where Hazel talks about having a book that you think everyone must read before the broken world can be put back together again, and this is that book. You won't regret buying it, and you certainly won't regret reading it. Why are you still reading this? Click Add to Cart NOW."
5," The Fault In Our Stars was one of the most beautifully written books I've read in a very long time. The story of Hazel and Augustus feels so true . It's not a depressing cancer story - it's life affirming.Two teenagers with cancer (one who is terminal) meet and fall in love. Their story, which could have been so cliched in lesser hands, is honest and funny and uplifting and romantic and deep. I highly recommend this book."
5," This book is probably one of the best books I have ever read. The characters were deeply thought out, and really did act like normal teenagers. The subject of cancer was approached in a way that didn't make it feel overwhelming. It's truly a story about young love and loss. I laughed and I cried and it made me question myself in ways I could have never imagined.Thank you, John Green. For this amazing, amazing work of art."
5, My friend suggested me this book and I am so grad he did.This book is so well written that you can see the character's face. There are many moments in this story that you'll never forget.I just loved the whole atmosphier created by the 3 main characters.Now I finished reading the whole book in 24hours and going to read it again as I miss them. I miss the croocked smile of Augustus.I highly recommend this book.
5,"t had every element of a book I loved: not too sappy, but beautiful and romantic. I can identify so much with the main character. Although it's a little predictable and I don't want to give anything away, I want you to know I cried for like, half an hour, even though that part of the plot was inevitable. Beautiful, beautiful story. I would recommend this book to anyone who's in for a good read. Really. Also, John Green is hilarious."
5," This is one of the best books I've read in a long time.  I gave it to my mom after I read it and she liked it so much she has her book club reading it now.  It's really well written and just a fantastic perspective on the mind of anyone suffering with serious illness, especially a young mind.  It's a love story and then some.  I can't recommend this book enough.  If you're even contemplating it, BUY IT NOW, you won't be disappointed."
5," love John Green, I have actually been folowing him and Hank on vlogbrothers when they had just started it with brotherhood 2.0. It was a great read, and quick shipping! I was bummed out because I was supposed to get an autographed copy and didnt but when I emailed they about it they were so considerate!! I was sent a autographed piece of paper from him, what an awesome gesture! This book is definitely a read most teens should read!"
2," read Looking for Alaska a few years ago, and loved the book so much that I vowed to read all of Green's subsequent novels. I was a huge fan of An Abundance of Katherines, but did not really enjoy Paper Towns for its unreal characters and implausible plot. This book, however, is why I love John Green. Funny, but touching. Insightful, but modest. This book is fantastic, and I recommend it to anyone. Very easy read, and great writing."
5," Great book, don't want to say too much and spoil it for people but it was an easy and intriguing read, it took me five hrs to get through. Sad that it's over though. And also I found so many quotes that I liked. This book will make you feel every emotion possible. One minute you're like ahh then you're like ughhh then aww then out of nowhere haha. It was amazing. I love John Green and his awesome talent for writing exceptional books."
5," Very short and the big reveal moment is too political. They're kids, so they're awkward in their interactions and don't seem to have enough time together to find this great love that everyone seems to think they have. I only read this because of the big fuss everyone was making...steer clear and read something worth far more of your time. I suggest the genres of historical fiction or fantasy...this is a waste of your time."
5," This  book was just so touching to me, I think this book is good for teens and adult, myself only 13, just was so emotional to this book, I loved this book because it just grab me, I thought it was wonderful on how it could take something so sad and make it have happy moments and be joyful, I'm not going to lie, the  book is wonderful and has many joyful moments but, the  ending was the best part, and  I'm not going to lie I cried&lt;3"
1," found this book because after losing my husband in December, I have found myself drawn to YA fiction. At first I thought that it was because YA tends to be lighter than adult fiction, but there is nothing light about this book.  It's simply a gorgeously written story about finding perfection in our faults.  The characters are richly drawn and I didn't want the book to end, ever.  I look forward to reading John Green's other books."
5," Not only is the story itself touching and beautiful beyond words, but the way this story is written makes me think it will be remember for many years to come. John Green does not just fill a blank sheet with words, but paints a frescoe of pain and beauty which makes my soul both dance and cry at the same time. This book stayed with me for a long time after I finished reading it. If you have not read it yet, what are you waiting for?"
5," This was an amazing book. Who knew that two teenagers with Cancer actually knew so more about life than an any adult?A beautifully written story about a very tough subject. Anyone with children, or experiences with illness and death will find some parts in this book excruciatingly painful to read. But, even after my heart broke over and over again, I think I'm a better person for knowing Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters."
5," want to talk to someone else who has read this book but then again, I don't. I believe to truly appreciate this, you have to internalize it and keep its meaning to yourself. It must have a different meaning and different impact on each of us to honor the words.I know that paragraph sounded like a bit of esoteric bull ****, but you have to read this to feel it. It's both blunt and beautiful and John Green, it's a gift."
5," This story is fantastic.  I tried two of Green's other works and lost interest within 100 pages, but this one kicks my butt good and proper.  It's one of the most original love stories I've read in a long time.  I'm a high school teacher, so I know teenagers and how they work, and the characters of Hazel Grace and Gus are perfectly developed, very much like Romeo and Juliet for today's generation.Yowza.  Read this book."
5," This gets six stars but they only give me the choice of five. This story was the best I've ever read, up until this point it didn't believe so, but it truly is. If you're looking for something to read I recommend this for you. You'll get sucked in.Dear John Green,Thank you for making me cry, but also thank you for giving me hope that there is an 'Augustus Waters' out there for me,Sincerely, you're fantastic."
2, LOVED this book. I liked this book so much that I am going to read it over and over again. It was such a cute love story. It had a great blend of happiness and sadness. It has inspired me to look at my life better and not take things for granted. It would be awesome if there was a sequel about what happens to Hazel grace. I feel the way she felt about An Apperial Affliction. Great book and would recommend it to anyone.
5," have never been much for sad stories, however, several people had suggested this book to me.  I decided to give it a try and I was not disappointed.  I have always been a sucker for media that can flawlessly blend comedy and tragedy, and this book did just that.  I went from laughing, to crying, to laughing AND crying all within the same page.  If you have not had the immense pleasure of reading this book, please pick it up now!"
5," heard some hype about this book and suggested it as the first read in my book club.  Others hadn't heard of it and weren't as enthusiastic about it.  After everyone started reading they immediately changed their attitudes about the book.  I loved it.  The characters are witty and intelligent beyond their years, making it easier for us in our 20's to get into a book in which the protagonists are teens.  Overall, highly recommend!"
5," loved this book because the author does an excellent job of making the characters' points of view so clear. I felt the emotions that they were feeling, and I was able to see their situation from theirs eyes instead of my own. That is such a difficult thing to do. I love books that are able to achieve that. I have read other books by this author that I did not like as much, but this one was very powerful! I couldn't pout it down."
5," was assigned this book as a summer English assignment. Before I even starting reading, I assumed the book to be tremendously boring. However; I'll just about-it and say I started this book today, but I have hardly been able to put it down all day. This book is wonderful and I would recommend it to anyone (granted you have a very large vocabulary or a dictionary on-hand). Definitely going to write a praising essay on this one! :)"
5," brought this book at a local department store for my teenage daughter, but eventually read it myself and loved it. The plot is good, the storyline is thought-provoking and the characters are endearing. But best of all I liked the fact that the book was able to invoke emotions that I haven't felt since I was a teenager, which is quite some years back. <a class=a-link-normal href=/Uncle-Byron-s-Antiquated-Time-Machine-To-Save-a-President/dp/1493658492>Uncle Byron's Antiquated Time-Machine: To Save a President</a>"
5," Very rarely do books make me cry, but this one did. Not in a bad way, but a good one. This book caused me to ball my eyes out at the pure magnitude of the love felt between two teenagers. While reading this novel I fell in love with the characters and every little aspect of their journey through life and love, a love I hope one day to experience myself. This is an amazing novel which I will recommend to everyone and anyone I can."
5," first read looking for Alaska after my boyfriend (who NEVER reads) recommended it. I loved it!! A year later I heard about The Fault in Our Stars, and I'm glad to say that John green has wrote two of the best books I have ever read. I'm not an emotional person but in the two books I've read by him I cried like a baby both times. The stories feel real and are very easy to get into. And after the first few pages you are addicted!"
5," had this book soon after it was published, but just never got time to read it.  I liked his other books, but to me this is so different.  Even though there was going to be tears, I cry a lot,  once I started it, I couldn't stop.  Augustus and Hazel are amazing.  The story is filled with good characters, people you'd like to know.  I highly recommend it, but the movie scars me, it's that crying thing!  Wonderful work Mr. Green."
5," feel like this book is my An Imperial Affliction, my new obsession, and a book that I greatly look forward to reading again! I bought it, and finished it within 24 hrs of the purchase. I couldn't set it down for long, and did so only when I had to.  It's an inspiring book, in so many ways. I can't get enough of Hazel's take on life, on the situations she faces every day. I suggest this book to everyone I talk to now."
2," Looking for Alaska is considered by some as John Green's masterpiece and I am glad to disagree.The book deals with death and people that happens to be dying because that is a side effect of having cancer but it doesn't feel to force into any direction in particular.I enjoyed the dialogues and overall the characters. It made me smile, it made me laugh and also cry.Recommended lecture !!! :D"
5," loved the 1st person story telling. It was raw and didn't try to gloss over the pain cancer causes the entire family, but especially the person inflicted. The love story aspect added to the humanistic nature of the story, but was done very tastefully. I hated the ending of the story, but isn't that what started the journey of Hazel and Gus throughout this book....hating the ending to a book? I definitely recommend for anyone!"
5," ...until after I finished the book that it was a young adult book or that it was being made into a move! But this 50+ woman just loved the book. I do not usually write reviews, but really felt this book deserved one. I couldn't put this one down, the characters in the book have stayed with me for days after I finished the book. I just LOVED the book and highly recommended for not only teens, but for their parents. OKAY...okay."
5," An unexpected love story that touches the reader on so many levels.It brilliantly deals with the complexity of young relationships both with parents and peers in the face of adversity. The characters are sophisticated in their thoughts, dialogue and actions. The teenagers are often more perceptive than the adults (which if why so many of them love this book), for they are not as much jaded as they are realistic. A joy to read!"
5," This is an amazing book. Trying to come up with a perfect summary of the book is a tad bit intimidating. I am imagining Hazel and Augustus as real individuals reading over my review and criticizing my effort to perfectly capture the meaning of the story. So, I will be brief-The Fault in Our Stars is about a girl who meets a boy and falls in love while dealing with the concept that life is short, sometimes shorter than others."
5,"f you're a John Green fan, I have one thing to say: This novel invoked more emotion than Looking For Alaska.If you're inexperienced with John Green, I'd like to reiterate that this novel with make you laugh and cry and probably very upset. It follows Hazel Grace - a teenager with cancer - on a journey that begins when she meets the fantastically crafted character of Augustus Waters - another teenager with cancer."
5," Let me start with the fact that I've never read any of Green's books. It was hard to choose (since I only had a ten bucks gift card) which book to buy, but I am quite happy with my choice.The Fault In Our Stars is, I dare say, one of the greatests books I've read. It gave me this warm feeling and emotionally broke me at the same time. With an unexpected turn and an overwhelming end, TFIOS won't dissapoint you."
5," absolutely adored this book. I constantly was thinking about it during breaks- wondering what was going to happen next, etc. It hooks you from the beginning, and as you get farther and farther into the book you feel more and more emotionally attached to Hazel and Augustus- laughing with them, smiling at joyous times, and weeping at times when your heart aches for them. Truly an amazing read, and I recommend it to everyone."
5," Loved this story it was so moving and you were inside or should i say you were outside looking in to the heart and soul of a cancer patient !!  I rated this a 5 it was so moving I even cried ...  well , I am in to stories so what can I say ? ha ha  No  Mr. John Green it was a great book and I read it because I am in a book club and this was chosen to be read in June !!  I have read it by the end of May !!!  Very good book !!"
5," This book is a seamless meld of the depths of pondering of mortality and young love. It actually makes you think. It is flawlessly written, had brilliant characters, and can make grown men weep their steely hearts out. I hadn't really read a book for fun in a long time and this book sparked my interest in reading again. It is a gorgeous story that transcends one particular audience; I recommend that all of humanity reads it."
2," bought this book because I had heard good things about it, and had enjoyed Looking for Alaska and Paper Towns. It did not disappoint. This book is harsh and real, full of truths. It leads you on and you can see the characters develop. This book allows for a nice quiet afternoon, I immediately yelled at anyone of my family members that tried to distract me. As a current Nerdfighter, I have to sign off like this.DFTBA,MC"
5," was telling my family to read this book. They asked for a quick summary. My response, teen love and cancer. This made everyone gasp and say no thank you. That's when I realized, despite the heaviness of the topic, I felt a kinship with the characters. I was never disappointed even though there is disappointment in the story. it was a good outlook on life from the point of view of people who can see the limits to life."
5," My God. If this book didn't make you cry, you are a soulless being. This book is indescribable. Basically, this book is a necessary read for any man, woman, teenager etc. This beautiful book gives a whole new meaning to life and it makes me grateful for everything, from the breath my lungs take, to the dark behind my eyelids when I blink. PLEASE READ THIS BOOK. PLEASEPLEASEPLEASE. You will always love it.  Okay? :')"
4," This book is up there with My Sister's Keeper for making you weep. I didn't think I would like this book because I felt it would be too depressing, but the author doesn't make it about this illness. He writes a beautiful love story with a side effect of cancer. The ending is kind of predictable about halfway through, but it doesn't make  it any less devastating. Read this if want to change your life. I know it changed mine."
5," How is it possible to cry and laugh within the same page... the writing is absolutely amazing.Hazel is an amazing girl and Augustus (oh Augustus) when can I day, his character is simply amazing - You just fall in love with him ... their story is fascinating (yes very sad.. very sad..) but he has such a good look at life, and what he has and how he just makes the best of an awful situation... just love love it..."
5," That's all I have to say about this book. It made me respect the life of people who have to go through this. It made picture every moment they had in my head so clearly like it had just happened to me yesterday. It made me cry, and I don't usually cry over books. It made me wish no one had to- or has to- go through any of this. It made me fall in love with all of the characters with every word I read. It made me speechless."
5," After the first couple of pages I was worried that this would be too easy of a read for me. However, before I finished the first chapter I was proved wrong.  The flow of the book is easy and wonderful, but it's full of challenging words that have since strengthened my vocabulary! The characters are so lovable and relatable and the story touches on the good and not-so-good qualities of humans and life. Definitely recommend!"
5," The book was really good. I couldn't put it down. You really like the characters and their idiosyncrasies. They are so incredibly smart and the feeling that their lives are being ripped away from them in their youth is heart wrenching.  Green portrays the ways in which they deal with their illness as cynical, extremely funny at times and extremely tragic at others. It is a very good book about death and dying. A must read."
5," had seen tons of people reading this book on the subway, was recommended by friends as well. Sometimes a story just stays with you, and this will for a long time. I've never read John Green before, and man he is so talented. In theory what would seem a very depressing story line, is very thoughtful, warm, at times hilarious and deep. You'll laugh and cry on the same page. And at 24 I can say it's anything but a YA novel."
5, could not put this book down. Absolutely beautiful. I can't even imagine to pick out words that would justly describe it. I couldn't do it justice. I cried a dangerous amount and laughed an equal amount. This is the kind of book you find comfort in reading many times and share with your friends. I have rarely loved a book so fiercely after only reading it minutes before... John Green knows how to pull your heart strings.
2," Awesome book.  Just finished and want to read again (for those who have read the book, how ironic is that).  Tragic and funny at the same time.  Witty, deep, poignant and insightful about facing cancer.  Very character driven with fun, smart banter as well as honest dialogue about how they feel dealing with cancer.Must read.  Clear you calendar to read and while reading have a large box of Kleenex at your side."
5," This book diffidently deserves a 5 star rating! From the beginning you were hooked with the way the author let you get inside the narrator's head and hear her inside thoughts and feelings. Getting that chance to develop a close connection with a character in a book is what made the novel so special.I would recommend it to anyone who loves reading in their free time, especially those who love romance and a good laugh."
5," As the parent of a young man who succumbed to cancer, I can say this book told it like it is.  Parts of the book are gritty and hard to read.  Parts of it are beautiful.  I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who is currently battling cancer, it may be too intense.  I would recommend it for anyone who has ever loved a young cancer patient.  It provides a view of what it is like to be young and have cancer.  A compelling read."
5,"t's a great read. Was recommended to me by a friend to read, so glad I read it. I could really relate to understanding the emotions portrayed in this book.If you can handle a book that will most like make you cry or at least tear up, then this is a must read. Like usual, the book is better than the movie, even though the movie isn't bad either. You just miss some of the details that are discussed in the book."
5," thought that this was a fabulous book. My daughter, who is a senior In college read it and also thought it was great. It made one think about their own mortality and what our presence in life means. It was a wonderful love story that caused me to cry when reading certain parts. I highly recommend this book to all those who want to read a  book that causes one to think. Thank you to my daughter for recommending it to me."
5," This book has earned its place in my short list of very favorites.  I don't know how it was possible, but the author managed to write a book about teenagers battling (and losing their battles to) cancer that is laugh-out-loud funny.  I was laughing through constantly flowing tears, however.  This book touched me in a way that few have, and when I finished it I just sat there, quietly smiling and staring at the last words."
5," This is probably the best book I've ever read. It is excellently written, and really connects the reader with the adventures of hazel and gus. It made me laugh and cry so much. I have memorized many great quotes from this book , though I can barely memorize a philosophical question from Aristotle or Socrates in history class. I will definitely be reading more john green books, and I hope they work extra hard on the movie."
5," read it in a day but still think of it months later. It then worked its way through the rest of our house. Subject is teens dealing with teen subjects (love, angst, friendship, peers) through the hyper-focus of terminal illness. Funny, sad, and thought-provoking. The author also has extensive Q&amp;As online for after you've finished the book. We read a lot in our house and this is one of the best books we've read in years."
5," Had some second thoughts after I ordered this when I saw it on the 'Teen' list, but it turned out to be as enjoyable a book as I've read in a long time.  It's amazing how a writer can fully depict an intimate love story without gratuitous sex (the polar opposite of the 'Fifty Shades ...' trilogy) centered around cancer, dying and death and leave the reader so uplifted.  Anyone else have a 2nd choice written by John Green?"
5," This book is fantastic! One of the best books I've ever read. I love all of John's books, but this one has a level of emotion and depth that really surprised me when I first started reading it. Whether you're a fan of John's, or have never even heard of him before, I suggest that you buy this book. And then buy it again for your sister, or your dad, or your niece or nephew. The Fault in our Stars is for everyone. DFTBA :)"
2," was skeptical about this book when I had to read it for my summer reading, I love reading, don't get me wrong. However, reading things assigned from school is always boring. Not this book! It made me laugh, it made me cry (and when i say cry, I mean serious snot-cry haha) the characters were great in this book and I definitely recommend this book to people who love reading. Also, its easy to download for Amazon Kindle!"
5," 4th time reading and it still feels like the first. Hurts just as much every time, but I find my self smiling more and more with each read. A book that can not be matched at least not in my infinity. If you have not read this wonderfully beautiful story about truly living your best life and understanding that weakness is ok and that those moments will make you a stronger person in the end then you need to, life changing."
5,"ve been a Nerdfighter for years, I was diagnosed with cancer when I was 15 myself (I'm 21 now and in remission since 2011) and I was too afraid of loving other people because I too thought of myself as a grenade waiting to explode. Only now though after reading this do I realize I missed out on a lot of teenagery things. But this book is amazing and beautiful and speaks to me as a cancer survivor as no other book has."
5," Through the pages the journey of this girl and her beloved have made me laugh, cry, sob, and wish. I wished that I could have this strong of a love, I wished that I knew these fictional characters, I wished that the book would never end, but alas, it ended. It breathtakingly ended, and it could not have been better. I have loved all of John Greens' novels, but this is my new favorite. Thank you for another amazing book."
5," Okay,.so the book is about two teens dealing with cancer and its inability to take our souls and dictate who and how we love.  As a one year cancer survivor myself, I fully identified with both Hazel and Gus.  Their thoughts and words run true to the core.  Yes, this book has two main protagonists with cancer, but the cancer is only a piece of their story...I highly recommend that you experience Hazel and Gus' story..."
5, This was one of the best books I have ever read and is definitely the best book John Green has written though don't be fooled it is incredibly sad and also it is beautifully writtenJohn Green has always had a way with words having famous quotes from his books but this time it seems he has really outdone himselfI highly recommend the book and if you're anything like me you'll have it finished in a day or two
5," John Green has managed to capture the challenges, experiences and humor of living with cancer.  Everything about the novel rings true.  It helps us all understand that despite the huge effect their cancer has on their lives, their relationships, and their family dynamics, they are individuals experiencing life as they know it.  You want to get to know them.  I couldn't put it down.  Thanks for such a great read.  Karin"
5," This review is hardly a review, but more of a praise. This book is just hauntingly beautiful. It just feels like every word of every sentence was carefully contemplated to insure that its reader felt everything the characters felt. I apologize for the lack of eloquence, but honestly, this is just one of those books that is destined to be read in high school English classes for the next 50 years. This book is important."
5," This book showed the exact feelings and thoughts any thoughtful cancer patient would or could possibly have, it shows exactly how she or he feels.not only is thus book highly detailed with an open mind to all thoughts, it is also highly packed with feeling and really makes you feel connected with the characters.. like your closer to them then your own family, I highly encourage you to read this AMAZING book, thank you"
5," think the writer has excellent insight as to the mentality of cancer patients and the way others treat them. I think this is just an example of how we consider with inferiority some others, like the disabled for example. I always had this idea about the need to change the view toward them. The message is very valuable and ethical as far as I understand it. This is a really nice novel. I recommend for others to read."
2," loved everything about this book and how it was written. It showed me the reality of people with cancer, one I had never encountered before. My congratulations to John Green, for writing such an extraordinary book, and for making these 5 days so exciting. I cannot tell you how much I loved it, and how much I grew attached to Hazel and Gus. Thank you for this marvellous experience, John Green, thank you so very much."
5," The author is able to draw the reader into the story from the very first pages. We are able to enjoy the private moments of two kids who fall in love despite having terminal cancer. With little to no chance of a long future, they act more like normal kids rather than cancer victims. There are many moments of laughter, mature insights, and an intense reality that cancer victims face with each other and their families."
5, Nope can't do it. If I start talking about this book I automatically start tearing up. What a beautiful beautiful story John Green has given us. I will alway be thankful for this book and the beauty that it has created.There are people out there who are much more eloquent than me and can write a better review than I can so I will leave them to it. Just know that I love every. single. second. of this book.
5, The love-at-first-sight plotline and all the ridiculous sap that comes with it has been done!!! Green made some very deep insights but they are mere blips. Dude could write a book of quotes and save us all from the sappy stuff. And where are these teenagers who memorize poetry and use all these nine-syllable words? Green found plenty of them. I can't believe that half of the epic Vlogbrothers could disappoint me so.
5," This book is the best book ever. John Green is a genius. This book has very detailed characters and does contain things about the characters' cancer, but this book is so much more than cancer. It inspires me. It will inspire you. You are sorry for the characters, yet you applaud them and want to be them. This book is complex and will leave in you in such emotions that you cannot fathom. I highly recommend this book."
2, read this book on the recommendation of a friend.  She knows that I am the mom of a 14 year old girl who died from a rare type of bone cancer 5 years ago.  What I loved about this book was the honest emotions of the characters.  How they bond from living in the cancer world.  Some of my best friends are people who I met during our five years in the cancer universe.  This book deserves all the praise it has gotten.
5, This is perhaps one of the most thoughtful pieces of literature I have ever had the great pleasure of reading. The Fault in Our Stars causes one to pause for hours on end and reflect on what they have just read. The metaphorical and symbolic resonances are astounding. It seems John Green continues to be an amazing intellectual and most authors can only childishly dream of aspiring to such heights of literary genius.
5," ...took me 7 hours to read this masterpiece that so captures the behind-the-scenes look into love that is hopeless but meaningful. I stayed up u til 2am reading, and I want to read it again. It was beautifully written, bringing tears to my eyes that brimmed over onto my cheeks. It was a modern Romeo and Juliet without the parents hatred, but instead with incurable sickness and Juliet not following her lover's fate."
5," loved this book and I really hope that more people are able to read it and fall in love with it. I can't believe how invested I was with this book... It made me laugh and it made me cry. Gus and Hazel shared true love and it was amazing to see their story develop together. I really hope that this becomes a movie so I came watch it over And over again, much like how I will be reading this book over and over again."
5," LOVE reading. I usually read a book once and than move on because there are so many more books to read.  The Fault in Our Stars in abook I MUST read again.  It was well written, thought provoking and enjoyable from begining to end. I knew I would love it as soon as Istarted to read.  It's kinda like when you first walk into that house you are going to buy or meet that special someone... you just know."
2," This book was absolutely fantastic. Green's work is always special in the way that his literature really makes you think about life and its unanswerable questions. He's one of the few authors that can have you uncontrollably crying one moment, and laughing the next. I'm only fourteen, but nonetheless, I find a lot of similarities between myself and Hazel, especially pertaining to her outlook on things. John, DFTBA."
5," This is a well written book for young adult readers. It handles the difficult topic of adolescents dealing with terminal cancer realistically and honestly. The young characters are totally-teen in the way they interact with humor and sarcasm, roller coaster emotions and love as they handle the unique struggles and losses of their friends, their families -- and coming to terms with their own ticking-clock."
5," This book was absolutely outstanding! I don't remember the last time I sat down with a really good book, but The Fault in Our Stars was the first great book I've read in years! I recommend this book to anyone even considering reading it. It's a very moving and heartfelt story. By the end of the book,which I finished in a day, I felt so connected to the characters I was crying! Again, definitely one of my favorites."
5," love this book! It is amazing, touching, and extremely well written. I love how John Green makes Hazel's life style like and how it is like the lives of some people with cancer. I love the romance between Augustus and Hazel and how it grows. I recommend this book for ages 10-21. I am 11 and this book worked our perfectly for me. I guarantee hat this book will touch your heart. It is amazing and you must read it!"
5," devoured this book. I honestly wanted to slow myself down so I had more time to enjoy my first read of this novel, but I couldn't do it. John Green is a wordsmith that has crafted a beautiful tale that anyone can find a point of relation. Full of cynicism, wit, love, laughter, and lessons about life I didn't even know I needed to learn, this book is a must read for anyone experiencing the side-effects of living."
5," The author has managed to write a love story on par with the notebook.  But this isn't your typical love story. This isn't a story full of romance.  This is a story of heartbreak, theirs and yours.  This is a story of two kids who live everyday to not what society would deem the fullest but what they decide is the fullest. It shouldn't be any other way. This book lives up to all the hype and I highly recommend it."
5," While written about a pair of cancer ridden teenagers, the Fault in Our Stars can be appreciated by readers of all ages. I loved the way this book challenged your perception of a fulfilled life and made you realize how crucial it is to stop and pay attention to the infinite moments in our finite lives.You're definitely going to need a box of tissues, but it will be worth every heart wrenching sniffle."
5," John Green makes a tragic subject, incredibly funny. His writing is fresh, witty and wry. With poignant insights and thoughts on what makes life worth living, what you would do if your days were numbered and how a terminal disease affects someone and their friends and family. This is a sweet, star-crossed, coming of age, love story. With interesting, lovable and funny characters that will inspire and delight you."
5, This might be the best book I have ever read. At first I was kinda forced into reading this book but I'm sooooo happy I read it. This book really shows you to be grateful for everything because your whole life could change at any moment and you don't realize how lucky u really are until it's all gone. I really recommend this book to anyone and everyone and I'm almost positive that u won't regret reading it &lt;3
5," had never come across John Green before and am back on Amazon to buy everything else he has ever written as I think he is a genius. This book made me feel how La vita e Bella film did, there is so much humor, but always with tragedy as an undertone, and yet each sad scene is also made to be as light and funny as possible. A phenomenal book with so much heart, absolutely loved it. Thank you John Green."
2," don't use perfect lightly.  I am an adult, and the two best books I have read in the last few years are about teenagers (Black Swan Green is the other; read that one too).  I want everyone to read and love this book.  The scene where Hazel and Augustus first meet is the best, most honest description of the onset of falling in love.  I just finished and I feel inclined to stop reviewing it and go read it again."
5," But to my surprise, I found it to be very heartwarming and courageous.  The characters were flawlessly created by the author. So well, in fact, that the reader can feel the frustration, anger and love each of them experience.  A fast easy read. I highly recommend this wonderful book to anyone who works in the medical field, parents with ill children and all teenagers who think 'this could never happen to them.'"
5, This book is fantastic! I have not read a book this well written and gripping in such a long time. I felt so connected to the characters!  I also loved the fact that it was set in Indianapolis which is where I live. Towards the end of this book I stayed up WAY past when I should have because I could not put this down until I finished it. It was also the first book to make me cry in God knows how long. Loved it!
5," was required to read this book during the latter part of my sophomore year of high school in my English class. I'm never a fan of the books schools want their students to read nowadays, so when I was assigned this book, I was very excited. Tons of my friends had read it and said it was wonderful, and reading it for myself, I agree. It has such a great story line, and John Green really has a gift for writing."
5," This book is amazing and not for those who wish not to cry aloud when reading.The author delves deep into the heart and soul, asking questions often not uttered out loud, and forces the reader to view living and dying and living while dying in a wonderful way.I laughed, cried, pondered, laughed more and cried til I thought my heart would burst, but it was worth it.Highly Recommended d f t b a"
5," Clever, funny, touching and overall bittersweet. The relationship is believable, the characters feel real and there is a streak of dark, gallows in all of the ill characters humour through the whole book, which along with the relationships and love (familial, platonic and romantic) which adds the warm fuzzies to a story otherwise with a dark cloud over it, as must be felt by all cancer survivors and sufferers."
5," The Fault in Our Stars is the star-crossed love story of Hazel Grace Lancaster and Augustus Waters. It makes you laugh a lot, it makes you cry a lot, and you will just wish it never ends. I loved this book. John Green crafted relatable teenage characters who aren't dumb, who aren't super smart brainiacs, but just people. If he writes another book, I will readily purchase it, because this book was just amazing."
5, read this book as a recommendation my librarian made at my local library. And I feel in love with it. I was reading the reviews on here and saw some of the bad ones were so mean. They said they couldn't understand the story and that you don't learn anything. THAT IS UNTRUE. You do have to be a deep thinker and understand the metaphorical reading. Like reading between the lines. I recommend this to everyone.
5," Teenage Hazel has cancer and suffers from depression. Her mother makes her go to a support group where she meets Augustus Waters. A basketball playing teenager with cancer. That's how it is for everyone at the meeting, they all have cancer. They fall in love and obsess over a book, together they flew to a foreign country to meet the author. That's when disaster strikes. Read it to find out what happens next."
5," loved this book. I read a blog Patrick Rothfuss was writing about a trip he was about to take. He was going to read this book on the flight. I like to read what writers read. I'm grateful I did. I loved Gus and Hazel Grace and their love affair. Everyone  wants to be loved like that, even if time is fleeting. The book is well written and pulled me in on page one. It's a book I want to read again and again."
2, This book was written very well and told a story unlike any other piece of writing. It made you see many different perspectives and ways a person can view life and the aspects of life. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read and an eye opener that makes you reflect on your life and truly appreciate all the simple yet beautiful blessings each of us have that we take for granted everyday.
5," Read it straight through in one shot... broke my heart (somehow in that good way only beautiful things can). I can guarantee, I'll always remember Augustus Waters. So glad I'd never heard of this book before it was recommended by Amazon. I was able to take it all in without preconceptions - and then to find out a movie is coming? Kind of amazing. Thanks for writing such a soul touching little book Mr. Green."
5," originally put off reading this book because I thought it would be too sad. Now I am just sad I did not read it sooner! This is a book that weaves together beautifully all aspects of life; disappointment, beauty, pain, tolerance, grief, love, peace, and appreciation for the present. The characters are intelligent, funny, and real. You will continue to think about them even after you finish the book. Enjoy!"
5," Can I rate it in tears instead of stars? Actually that would require a  much higher rating scale than 5. I bought it for my 14 year old son, but it was too much for him emotionally. It is so beautifully written, but the theme of death combined with young love was heartbreaking and a bit confronting. This is not a criticism of the book, more a warning to arm yourself with emotional armour or a box of tissues."
5," Although I will read almost anything, this isn't my preferred genre. I will likely not read it again. I won't need to. The story is etched upon my heart. (Oh how Gus would sneer at that!) Mr. Green, you will be responsible for one very confused husband tonight, attempting to console a crying wife who just marathon read your story in one session. But don't feel guilty, because this story is worth every tear."
5," When reading books- any type of book- I normally don't cry. This book made me laugh at first then cry a gallon worth of tears. The love in this book is true and I would love to have this love (without the cancer would be nice). This is a MUST read. I read it in less than 48 hours. Definitely worth staying up till 3 in the morning to finish. If you love romance with a bit of sorrow, this is the book for you."
5," Based on reader feedback I expected more from this story. This is the only reason I don't rate this as a five. However, the book was still well written, captivating, and moving. It is a great book to read with younger people (YA) and great for discussion. The friendship and relationship that develops between the main characters is powerful. Though the book is not realists in some aspects, but it is fiction."
5," At first glance I thought this book was going to be a crapy romance book and that's why it was so popular.But I finally decided to get it even though I wasn't really sure I would like it(I hate really romantic books).But I was wrong this book is truly astonishing,and amazing.I can't believe how powerful this book is it unbelevieble.I recommend this book to anyone looking for a good popular young adult book."
4," Without giving away the plot of the book, I don't care what your age is, buy this book!!!  It is an amazing book about love, sickness, health and what we all can learn from this life.  John Green takes us inside the world of teenage love and illness, friendships and those who leave our sides during it.It doesn't matter your age, appreciate books like this for what they are, God given talent in paper form."
5, never had an interest in reading this book... until the one day when I did. I know that it doesn't make sense but there was so much HYPE behind it most of which were from teenybops; I figured I would just be disappointed. I am so happy that I finally decided to give it a shot. It was a page turner in deed. I could not put it  down and finished in a matter of hours. I immediately went to watch the film...
2," This book was well written, I loved the dialect between the two main characters. I don't want to spoil anything, but it was just a great love/friendship story between two people. I loved her relationship with her parents, the support was just always there. Great read for me!! I needed a good book with a good sad story. I'll definately read more of this authors books, if they are this good and easy to read."
5," When I began this book, I thought I was going to be one of the people who despised it. But the deeper I got into it the more I understood. At the beginning I thought Hazel was going to die. That it would end on a cliff hanger, like her favorite book. But soon I realized that this wasn't going to have a corny ending like that. I was in tears for the last half of the book. This book is worth your time. Okay?"
5," Your heart can't help but go out to the narrator Hazel and her love interest, Augustus, but the book is a little uneven. Though charming,funny, and very smart, both characters border on precocious and pretentious. So though this book is heartfelt  and likable, it's also a little cloying and overwritten; Hazel rails against conventionality and sentimentality, but that's what this book gives into in the end."
5," While I could sit here and write a thousand page essay on why this novel is amazing, I still don't think I could do it justice. If you want to cry and laugh and be inspired and be given raw ideas that allow you to think beautiful thoughts and be given questions to answers you thought you understood, then read this story. If not, I suggest you go search Twilight by Stephanie Meyers and be on your merry way."
3,"t's been 25 years since I've read any fiction.With trepidation I read this after losing several friends to cancer and being their caretaker at the very end. The themes dig up buried memories of very connected, passionate, and alive people who thought deeply about the world without the superficial, narcissistic comfort of popular mythologies.Well done, my boy.Well done."
5," This book is amazing, let me just start off with. I can explain it. I'm a 12 year old girl and this book will forever make a mark on my life,  It's just so romantic, funny, and heart felt. SPOILER ALERT: when Gus Dies I just started straight out bawling. I cried the rest of the book. Every time they said Gus's name I cried harder. I know I will be rereading this book., and recommend this book to everyone."
5," A teenage boy and girl are tragically and fatefully aligned together as friends, soul mates, and (kind of) lovers.  The wisdom and thoughtfulness of each character is real, at times like two young (and wise) philosophers going toe to toe in a teenage sandbox.Great book.  I was riveted.  Parts of the book made me chortle, ponder, want to cry, and simply root for each of the two main characters."
5," John Green captivated the most beautiful, romantic, and funniest love story that I have ever heard. They both had their faults well I guess that's why it's called the Fault in Our Stars but they even each other out by showing them that the things that they believed they wanted didn't even matter. He showed that love through the good times, bad times, and sad times can still stand strong even after death."
5," only just finished this book and I am literally left without words. The Fault in our Stars is the most thought provoking book I have read in a long time and I keep finding myself thinking about every little detail that what said. This book was written like you are in Hazel's mind and you know exactly how she feels, thinks, doubts, and loves. Beautifully executed, I feel like I owe this book everything."
5," As a fan of John Green's video blog, I was very excited to order this book.  I preordered it.  There were terrible problems, once it was time to ship.  I was extremely persistent and it was WORTH IT!This book is a poignant, funny, intelligently-written story about what is means to love.  It also speaks to loss of all sorts and how people handle that.  I would highly recommend it.  Prenez vos mouchoirs!"
2," Although the premise is sad, this is an extremely enjoyable read.  It is funny from beginning to end with smart and witty characters.  One of my favorite quotes was:Mom - When did you become so smart?  It seems just yesterday I was explaining to you why the sky is blue.Daughter - Why is the sky blue?Mom - CuzI highly recommend this read!"
5, What a great story. I loved the book within a book and intellectual humor. Thank you John Green for leaving something to my imagination but giving me phrases that will stay with me. I am not a cancer survivor but I find myself with the same conflict of meaning in life and purpose as the characters did. I have been to too many funerals of young people and thought the same things he stated so eloquently.
5,"m a fan of green's novel Looking For Alaska, but this novel was absolutely amazing. It takes you through an emotional life of two teenagers battling cancer, and finding meanings of love and loss. TFIOS will make you smile, and cry, and maybe feel some butterflies as you read of true love between star-crossed lovers. John Green is a fantastic author, and I'd definitely recommend this book to anyone."
5," To have never had to deal with anything like this but to still feel the entirety of it through words is a beautiful thing. This book is many things at once, which leaves the reader feeling - just feeling it all, and that's the mark of a well-told story. It had me laughing and crying and then laughing through my tears. There are some lines I had to highlight and which I will carry with me going forward."
5," This book was amazing, sure I didn't cry but I did feel the pain. I loved all the philosophical questions and the style of writing, straight forward but so artful. If u like to actually think about death, life, stuff and are okay with feeling the pain of others and like crazy teenage love and ok with cuss words and just like to read for the heck of it... READ THIS BOOKHave fun realizing reality!!"
5," am an adult and usually find YA books very limited in the depth of their characters. This book is a big exception.  I have already recommended it to many more of my adult friends.  The dialogue in this book is wonderful, things characters say to one another are not at all predictable, they are unexpected and original and ring absolutely true.  Loved this book!! I can't wait to read more by John Green"
5," With my schedule, I don't get a lot of time to read.  However, I made time for this book and finished it faster than I've ever finished a book.  It held me from the first page and, even though I had a feeling how it would end, I couldn't wait to get there and see how it was written.  The dialogue is captivating.  The characters make you want; to be friends with them.  A must have for the reading list!"
5," love this book it made me laugh, cry, and smile. But most importantly it was good it wasn't like other books where there's boring parts, or that drag along with nothing happening everything fused together perfectly. The worst part was that it's over. It's brilliantly written with every detail giving spectacular affect. I can't wait to start another book by the wonderful author John Green. P.S. DFTBA"
5,"t is very sad, but you need to think about how the characters in this book view life. They aren't afraid of death. They think of life as a side effect of death. I don't think that Hazel was very sad to be dying, she wanted to make sure that her friends didn't get hurt from her death. She was scared that she was like a bomb, blows up and hurts anyone in sight. This is a great book, but it is very sad."
5," Helps you understand about having cancer and the realistic mixed emotions. It was disappointing that the author, Peter van Houtem ended up being an ungracious character but he too was a victim, or side effect of cancer. As someone who is a recent cancer survivor I could relate to the feelings and situations presented in this novel. As a teacher of English, many of my students have enjoyed this novel."
2," recommend A Fault in Our Stars unconditionally. Although, it is a love story about two teens with cancer and their families it is not a gratuitous tear jerker in any way. It is a real story with real life loving characters whose wit, humor, and love override the underlying struggle. Some stories just cut to the essence of life and relationships; this is one of them. You will love it too!!"
4," have read other  Green 's books ,but this by far is my favorite! I connected with the characters and feel in love with them as I read there stories. It's well written and takes you on an adventure that we'll make you happy, sad, mad, and confused. When I fished the book I found myself just as Hazel did, wondering what has become of Hazel and Isaac. I loved the book and would recommend it to anyone."
5," feel like you have to be a hipster to like John Green's books. I wanted to love this, I really did. I thought the plot sounded fantastic. However, I wish it were more realistic. High school kids talking as though they are college professors? Come on. They all came off as a bunch of hipsters who thought they were better than anyone else out there. I don't understand how this book became so popular."
5," This book was really sad,it had twists and turns about young long lasting love. The main thing I caught was that in the end, I thought the theme was a life story but then, I thought it over and said best quote ever dont let love go when you know that its going to last. Best book ever gonna keep reading forever buy the book andcry have an adventure of the Story/quoting life of Hazel Grace Lancaster"
1," My daughter talked me into buying this book for her. I read it after she did and had trouble putting it down. Now she asked me to give the book back to her. I might buy my own copy. I fell in love with Augustus Waters, he would do anything for Hazel Grace. My favorite part of the book is egging Monica's car, she did a horrible injustice to poor Isaac. I am going to look for more books by John Green."
5," This book was amazing. It really spoke to me. I love how Hazel wasn't weak. She knew what was coming and knew she wouldn't live forever. Her and Augustus are an amazing couple. They're both so strong, and they both understand  the world in different ways, making them perfect for each other. After reading this, I realized that things can be worse, and even if they are that bad, things can get better."
5," At this time, everyone must know that this is one of the greatest books of 2012 and blablabla, but it really is. Because it's YA, the content is very deep, but the language is simple. The characters are very well build, so you can relate to them and cheer for their story. In no time, you will fall in love with Hazel Grace and Augustus. It's the kind of book that you will want to finish in one night."
5," This book is so wonderful. I laughed, I cried, I fell in love. I have goosebumps just moments after reading it. And I almost can't wait to read it again even though it is one of the single most emotionally trying books I have ever read. It is such a beautiful work of art. I can't recommend this book to other readers enough. What can I say? It made me feel beautiful and sad. It made me feel infinite."
5," When I bought this book, I worried it might be too girly.As it turns out, it was, but not in the usual twilight kind of way; it's characters turned out to be incredibly realistic, each with very real and serious concerns about very real aspects of their lives and what some people in their condition go through.I can foresee I will be revisiting this book in the future."
5," This book was witty and smart and had me laughing as tears rolled down my face. My family is experiencing something very similar to this story and I found this book to be healing. There is no way to know how to deal with these situations, but these kids and their take on life helped somehow. Maybe this book is for me what An Imperial Affliction was for them. Thank you for writing this...I needed it."
2, This book gives hope and provides understanding to the world of cancer and the effects that it has on those that it inhabits. I have never been so upset that a book has ended and I wish more deeply than anyone could imagine that I could take hazel and agustus with me now that the book is over. I am left with the awful feeling that I will never find anything near as satisfying as this book was to me.
5, This book lived up to its hype.  John Green wrote a book that made me go on the emotional roller coaster with the characters.  I loved every minute of it.  I actually did not cry that much during the book since I essentially guessed what was going to happen.  But the letter at the end tipped me over!  So beautiful and elegant!  I am so glad I bought this book so I can read it over and over and over!
5, On the cover a guy says that its a staccato of humor and tragedy. I truly cannot find a better way of putting it. In one chapter I went from crying from laughter to holding a lump in my throat to try not to cry to then finally letting go. I am certainly going to reread it to make notes on sections I want to tell others about or quotes I like. If your thinking about this book just get it...right now.
5," So often we are preoccupied by what we should add to our bucket list and as that list gets longer, we forget to live in the smaller moments.  The Fault in our Stars reminds us that it is the smaller moments that should be our bucket list.  Hazel's story doesn't end with the reader feeling sorry for her; instead you feel like a better person because you witnessed how she and Gus lived and loved."
5, enjoyed this book on so many levels. It's a beautiful story that deals with a tough subject in an honest and forthcoming way. The characters are strong and 'real'. The telling of the story from a teen's perspective deals with the subject matter in a whole different way. I would recommend this book to young adults as well as to grown ups who could learn to look at cancer and death a whole new way.
5," Although this book made me depressed ninety percent of the time, it was welcomed. I like the feeling of  getting too wrapped up in characters and having a little piece of you wish they were real; so you wouldn't feel so dumb, for crying every time they were hurt and smiling whenever they felt joy. I'm not saying this book won't disappoint you, because it will, but to me that's what made it so good."
5," Amazing book overall. I cried at moments and laughed at others. This is the kind of book you never want to end. Huge round of applause to John Greene for his amazing work. Augustus Waters- I will love you forever! Hazel reminded me a lot of Talia Joy Castellano, although they were fighting different types of cancer their attitudes were so similar. Thank you John Greene for this beyond amazing read."
5," recently read this book on the recommendation of my granddaughter. I found it very interesting in the way in which it was written. A must read ,giving an insight into how cancer patients react with each other. The book although quite sad, is not at all morbid.For any one touched by childhood cancer, this book gives the ups &amp; downs in a very realistic way.Certainly worthwhile reading."
5," This is easily John Green's best novel so far. It was gripping and emotional, but never in a way that made it feel cheesy or manipulative. It was a story about two teens - Hazel Grace Lancaster and Augustus Waters - who were living with cancer, but I never felt like it was a book about cancer. I'm not sure that I can really do the book justice with a review, except to say that it was just lovely."
5, Plenty of people have told you that this is a very sad/depressing story and it is but it is so sweet. The way the Green decided to end the book was a dream killer but throughout the rest of the book you will love the story. I couldn't put it down. If you are not so fond of the begging then you need to keep reading cause I don't know who in the world could possibly hate this book. I loved it!!!!!!
2," read this book because so many people seemed to find it interesting (especially young adults) it was a difficult story of young love that not only was not pure mush but was beautifully written. although the story is fiction, in this day and age it could be real. there were times when I could relate to the story and the struggles of dealing with cancer and death.a good read, couldn't put it down"
5, My 12 and 14 year olds have read this and loved it. I want to read it next since they had good things to say about it. My 12 year old son liked reading about how the character handled a difficult situation. He found it interesting and a good read. Didn't take him long to finish and he would recommend it to others as a great book. Worth the purchase for sure if two of my kids gave it high ratings.
5," read this book for school because I needed a silent reading book, I'm not a big reader but... WOW what an amazing story. I can relate to hazel so much but if u can't the u can really learn from her I just didn't want to finish it, it made me almost cry that the story was over and so was the live of hazel...that I will ever get to know about. I would absolutely read this book it changed my life."
5," Sad but it must be read. No, you do not get a choice. This book is to romance stories as Oliver Cromwell is to kings. They perform the same duty but one is remembered more than the other. This book shall not fear oblivion, as it is entwined with the world with no true definition to a category. Not love, disease, or life book. It is simply, I suppose, the true book of the side effects of dying."
2," WOW!!! The author has a unique ability to take morose subject matter and make it bitter sweet, funny, and hopeful. I thought I would hate this book! Thought it would be far too sad to stomach. I could not have been more wrong. While I did cry for a good 10 minutes after the ending, they were tears of hope with a renewed respect for the human spirit. LOVED this book. So incredible well written."
5," could not put this book down. I was cautious with it at first, wondering if I would be interested in the life of Hazel- the main character in the story...but I got so overwhelemed with what was going to happen next in this story, I found myself putting off things I needed to do on a daily basis. Warning: be prepared to cry if you are going to read this. It is a great tale of life and love..."
5," This is not the type of story I would normally go for.  Books with such a premise can so easily become melo-dramatic, cliche, and just plain depressing.  So it's a tribute to Green's writing that he can take what could have been a cheesy A Walk To Remember 2 and instead create a lovely and engaging story that had me both laughing and crying in spite of myself.  Absolutely recommend."
5," Not only did this book make me laugh, and cry, it made me think. It has been awhile since a book caused me to examine my own views on thus world we are living in and the life I am living. It is a constant page turner and I loved the lessons and the love story along the way. Thank you John green for a book that can hopefully change some of the way so many young people live in this world today."
5,"t's unfortunate that someone told me the ending beforehand. I must have issues because I still decided to read it anyway. I'm glad I did and I think a part of me is happy that I could slightly prepare myself. Slightly, it was still hard to read. I don't think I've ever laughed or cried so hard in one book. It was beautifully written, combined with a touching story that I could not put down."
5," love this book!! It is an excellent novel for junior high and high school. I love how this book has all the things I'm looking for such as a captivating love story, comedy, and an all-around heart warming novel. I would (and all ready have) recommend this to all of my friends and family. This book, without a doubt, will stay in your hands from the second you start until the very last word."
5,d like to say that this book is everything amazing that everyone else mentioned AND also very entertaining with sweet and witty humor throughout most of the book.  It was very easy for me to get hooked right away.  I think guys would enjoy this book too!  Not just for girls.  :)  And I suppose I have a thing for star-crossed lovers and boys with one leg.  ;)  p.s.  Don't read any spoilers!
5, loved this book I could read it over &amp; over it is will make you laugh &amp; cry &amp; be mad. I recommend this book to everyone to read it's one of those books you just pick &amp; read again &amp; again hoping you will be able to help change the ending lol &amp; the ending it another whole thing read &amp; you will find out you will not be disappointed &amp; good for all ages young &amp; older lol  !!!!! Please read !!!!
5," A tear jerker that I just couldn't put down. My heart hurts for these incredibly well developed, deep characters. This is the type of book that you sit and think about and cry about and re-read time and time again. This that book. It makes you feel like you just met a whole town of new people and they're your best friends giving you a window into their lives. Thank you John Green. Thank you."
5," What a great book. I was looking to start reading again, and picked up this one because I heard of the positive reviews. It was so much better than I expected. I read it in less than 5 days because i literally could NOT put it down! I laughed quite often, and cried probably the same amount, and I love when books can do that to the reader. This is a fabulous book and I recommend it to anyone!"
2, knew the tears would come but they came like rain. At first the book seemed cliche but I began to really love the characters. after that I couldn't hope more for a happy ending for them. I think it's ironic that we don't find out if the girl survives in book and the book mentioned in it. I love the romance. But it hurt to read because it broke my heart completely. Breathtakingly beautiful
5," One of the best and saddest novels i have ever read, this book is full of emotions and i couldnt be happier that i read it... i am telling all my friends and family to pick it up, becasue once you do you will not be able to put it down... enjoy and have lots of tissues ready near by... i may probably read it again one day, because you fall in love with the characters from the very begining."
5," randomly picked this book off Amazon reviews, didn't know the author (although I guess he is a reasonably big name). It didn't seem like a plot line I would enjoy but it had good reviews, and I can see why! There is some really profound and amazing dialog, much more mature than you would expect from the teenage characters. I've recommended it several times and bought a copy for Christmas!"
5," This book was amazing. When I started this book, I was struggling with depression, and I started this book because it was recommended to me several times, so I read it. John Green's characters made me change my views on so many things. It's taught me so much about life, and love, and hurt, and heroes, and how to keep living and this book has really changed my life. I strongly recommend it."
5," This book is one of those books you long for when you start a new book. You can't put it down, you connect with the characters and you dread actually finishing it because you never want it to end. The characters are supremely written and that becomes apparent in the first few pages. The story itself is heartwarming, and also realistic. I have been highly recommending this book to everyone!"
5,"f you are one of the lucky ones who have heard about this book, congratulations!I myself was told that this book was amazing,and fantastic,that it was a must-read. And it is,this book is everything you wished it would be,and oh so much more. You may even find yourself crying because of the tragedy and beauty of this excellently written book. And I hope you do. Promise me,okay?"
5, can't begin to understand why somebody wouldn't read this.  I just finished it and I still have tear marks on my cheeks. I didn't really want to read it at first but i did anyways because everybody is talking about hoe amazing John Green is. This is the first book that I read by him and all I have to say is : oh my God. If you aren't reading this then I don't know what you're waiting for
5," This is one of the best books my book club has read in years.  We had a worthwhile discussion because this book is so well-written.  The two main characters are fully developed. The secondary characters are developed to add a great deal to the book.  Even though the book was about terminally ill teenagers, it was not maudlin.  I highly recommend it to anyone who loves a well-crafted story."
5," This book is definitely worth your time!! It has the perfect use of innocence that compliments its unadulterated story. You become one with the main character, Hazel Grace, with the very first sentence. It is extremely descriptive in such a short amount of pages you don't want it to end! You really become a part of the story. One of those books you can't put done!!! Kudos to John Green!!!"
5," This book is amazing, no joke.  Two teenagers with cancer that fall in love, and face the challenges with their illnesses together, *sigh* it's a beautiful story of love, life, death, noticing the little things, curiosity, and perseverance, John Green did a wonderful job!  I recommend this for the more mature readers because it covers rather deep topics.  I'm looking forward to the movie!"
2, There was nothing about this book which wasn't beautiful and striking and heart string pulling.  There were parts that made me laugh and parts that made me cry.  This book was so perfectly set up and so perfect in every respect that I cannot give it any less than five stars and I can't express how much this book sucked me in and wouldn't let go as I rode a roller coaster that only went up
5," Amazing and awe inspiring! I was expecting it to be amazing because of what I've heard but this really was inspirational. one of my best friends just got diagnosed with stage three bone cancer so I decided to read it with her, and afterwards she told me that she would be Hazel because Hazel is everything she ever wanted to be even before she got diagnosed. I most definitely recommend it!"
5," This was both amazing and sad.I loved it so much &amp; I recommend it to everyone.  Maybe you all will find yourselves falling under Augustus's spell or Hazel's intelligence. Because I have. I have fallen so deeply for these characters, I'm not sure if I'll find a way out.Thank you to Mr. John Green for such a beautiful book.Thanks for helping me make two new friends."
5," My father passed from pancreatic cancer a little over three months ago so this book really hit home and made me think of him and his fight. It was so moving and wonderfully written and just beautiful.  Cancer sucks and this book doesn't sugar coat it, just tells it how it is.  I would recommend it to anyone who asked. The last few chapters are tear jerk eras, at least, for me so beware."
5," give this book five out of five stars as it has everything I typically look for in a book. Well-developed characters, humor, and an engrossing relational story.  I also really enjoyed the literary references to T.S. Elliot's Prufrocks. Its a little bit of a tear-jerker at times, but its a fast and moving read. Would totally read it again and am excited to see the movie this summer :)."
5," bought this book after it being recommended by at least half a dozen of my friends. It's real, and honest. The kind of novel you read and thank the writer for saying the things we think but wouldn't dare to say. Well developed characters and excellent dialogue. Worth buying as a gift or for yourself. I'd just like to note it's more of a young adult book but necessarily for teens only."
5, have not read a book in 3 days since I was a child. I'm not big on reading mostly because most books cannot keep my interest. This isn't the type of book I usually read either. This was super. I would say that everyone should read this and fall in love with the characters and feel what they felt as I did while reading. GREAT JOB John Green. I'll keep up with your YouTube blogs. DFTBA!
5," highly recommend this young adult novel for it's wry humor, honesty, and gut-wrenching plot.  If this doesn't make you appreciate your health and long life, nothing will!  One of my ninth-grade students (boy) was reading this at the same time I was.  We both were in awe!  One romantic scene in particular might offend conservative parents, but it's nothing most kids haven't seen on TV."
5," thought the story was fine with a nice little twist however, for such an emotional subject I just didn't feel it. I felt the characters were lacking and I found them less than likable. The whole vibe of the book had this weird alternative vibe like the characters were supposed to be deeper than they were and it just didn't fit. I know most people loved it but it just wasn't my taste."
5," This book was absolutely amazing! I've read John Greens Looking for Alaska but The Fault in Our Stars was beyond compare!!! It made me really think about life and how I should live everyday like my last and of course I cried like a baby I'm not even embarrassed and I wished that Gus was a real person. I can't wait to see the movie, this is now my favorite book and always will be &lt;3"
2," On the surface one would think that a story about teens dying from cancer would be incredibly depressing, but Brown manages to make this lovely story uplifting.  The characters are so real and engaging that I could feel their heartache.  Instead of being a story about dying, it is more about how to make the most out of living.  I read it in one day and was so sad when I got to the end."
5," The Fault in Our Stars is one of those books that makes you ponder about the greater meaning in life. It is about this young girl who has been diagnosed with pulmonary cancer. She meets a boy called Agustus who is a Cancer survivor himself. She discovers the greater meaning in life. This is a book about a brave ongoing fight, love and trying to fit in and find your place in this world."
5, This book was great but at the same time devastating. I knew it was going to be sad because I was told but I did not expect this. I was pleased though....... in a way happy books are the saddest. Happy impossible endings are sometimes more wrong and sad then heart breaking reality endings. In all it was a amazing book that I could not put down. I would defiantly recommend it to anyone.
5," Reading this book I must say was incredibly hard. My mother had lymphoma cancer and is in remission and I put my self in opposite position. What would happen to us if either one had died. Although this love story did make my laugh very loud, out loud. It also brought me to tears at least twice. I recommend everyone to read this. I sincerely hope that they do.Purely life changing."
5," This is one of the best books I have read in a while. I LOVE how realistic it is. Many of the books you find out there are all sappy love stories or quick relationships. In this books, I just love how Gus's and hazels relationship develops throughout the story and really gives us time to get to know them. This book also contains some outstanding quotes and thoughtful thoughts. Love it."
5," This is Gary's wife writing this review. This book was excellent.  I am a 61 year old woman &amp; have been battling ovarian cancer for seven years.  Even though I am an adult, I can still relate to the thoughts &amp; feelings of the much younger characters.  I have already recommended it to several adults.  The book is well written &amp; deeply moving.  I plan to see the movie when it comes out."
5," Beautiful, yet sad. This book really captures to lives of people with an incurable illness and ties in with a first love. It pulled on my heart and made me laugh all in the same chapters. John Green, as an author, was introduced to me through this book and through his writing, I will continue to be a fan. He's great with words and story. Definitely a book I would recommend to others."
5," loved this book so much, I wish there was more to it. I recommend this book to anyone who has lost a loved one to cancer, it gives you a whole different perspective on what they're going through. I lost my dad to adenoid cystic carcinoma, and it gave me a different view on how he probablyfelt. I will probably read this book multiple times in the future. Thank you, John Green."
5, adored this book. It isn't often where you discover a book about dying that is so life affirming. My point words cannot adequately describe the bittersweet joy it was to devour this book and how much I am looking forward to dissecting and ruminating each beautiful nuance. Thank you John Green for writing such deep and realistic characters and for letting us fall in love with them.
5," This is hands down one of the best books I have read in decades.  My thirteen year old granddaughter read it first and recommended it to me.  Although I was hesitant to read it at first due to the very sad subject matter, I was instantly hooked.  John Greene is a gifted, intelligent, and extremely unique author.  The love story is beautiful and the characters live in my heart still."
2, What a well written book about love and illness. After a long time a book has made me cry and that is partly due to the sarcasm and with and the un-pityful manner in which the author makes you feel not only so sad for the characters but also so grateful for my health.I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would definitely recommend it to my friends and family. John Green is a star
5," have read several books written by John Green.  This book is my favorite out of them all.  I laughed and I cried while reading this.  I became attach ed d to the characters and wanted to know what was going to happen.  Some portions of the book make you stop and think about your life, your goals, where you are heading. I would highly recommend this book.  Nerdfigjters for the win!"
5," This book brings to life what happens in the real world, most sex offenders will choose their victims within their own families, and never see the evil in their actions and victims almost never get any answers but will repress what has been done. It brought me to tears, it made me angry, it also reminds how victims are strong enough to survive and move forward with life, great read."
5," This book is truly a work of art. John Green has captured the emotional turmoil of cancer in the most realistic and touching way - by looking at it through the eyes of a patient. All of the characters are real people with depth and emotion, and not just cancer kids. Hazel and Gus are real, living, breathing human beings, and I am so grateful to John for bringing them into my life."
5," The lives of the teens illustrated in the book certainly make you stand up and take notice of how blessed we are.  Very interesting, especially since I am in the medical field.  They really give you and indepth view of their most personal thoughts.  Sometimes, we don't like to think about it,  but there are many more children facing the challenges of life and death. God Bless them."
5, This was not the usual cancer story.  I have had friends with cancer and I have wondered what does one talk about with this person.  This book opened my eyes on what to say or not.  It let you know what the cancer victim is feeling and what you can do to help.The ending was a surprise  but when you are reading about teenagers with cancer you have to expect some heart breaks.
5," This was a book club selection that I enjoyed.  Extremely quick read, if not somewhat cliche.  While the voice is that of a teenage girl, I felt Green did a good job of elevating the language into a believable, intelligent account of how a terminally ill adolescent can hold the dichotomy of alarming maturity and perspective while also possessing an endearing innocence and naïveté."
5," Reading this book will bring you nothing but heartache, but in a good way. You understand the being of humans and the meaning of love, and how you yourself are not looking for attention but the universe looking for your attention. I recommend this to open minded people who can handle diversity in such a book as The Fault In our Stars. Happy reading and keep a box of tissues close."
4," Yep, definitely still crying.If you have any time at all, read this book. Put some perspective into your life. Life is beautiful. This book is beautiful and this author is a genius. The symbols, the metaphors, the love. I just can't even express the way this book unravels other than, you need to read it.Also, if you do not cry, you're a robot and heartless."
5," John Green basically breaks heart for a living. TFIOS brings up so many emotions that while reading it I didn't even know what to feel. This book is a work of art that starts to feel like is happening in your life as you read. It becomes a part of you, and I don't think I will ever forget this book. Lets just say that John Green can very well fathom his stars into constellations."
2," This was an educational read, told in a series of teenage one-liners, that strangely, had me crying through most of the story.  Adolescence is no time to struggle  with cancer, falling in love, and finding that heroes have feet of clay.  We all have a finite lifetime, but for the two stars of this story, it is far too short.  Try it.  It will give you a new perspective on living."
5," Funny, touching, meaningful and smartly written, The Fault in the Our Stars presents characters facing up to the scariest circumstances — cancer in myriad forms. You'll come to care about them, deeply, and not just them, but their parents and friends. I read a review that calls this book damn near genius. I just wish I could think of a better phrase than that."
4," A touching novel about two young teenagers suffering from the side effects of dying..cancer..Love, tragedy, spirit, and charisma . Makes you reflect back on your own life and value and cherish what you have and how lucky you truly are. Recommended for anyone who will take the time to truly read and understand the hardships and sincerity of this novel which is brilliantly written."
5, This is the first book I ever read by John Green and I was a little skeptical about it but once I opened the book and started to read I was completely captivated by this book ! His writing style flows nicely and it keeps you intrigued without getting bored to where you feel like skipping chapters . The book was phenomenal and I recommend that everyone takes a chance and reads it.
5," A beautifully written, compelling novel that  immediately inserts you into the lives of the characters.  Definitely not the usual novel about adolescent angst.  Deep, rich human insight and emotion.  Laughter and tears.  I definitely will recommend this book, but carefully,  because of the loss people have or are experiencing in their lives.  I feel enriched from having read it."
5, This book will change the way you look at things. When you read the description you might not want to read the book because  it's about kids/teens with cancer but this book is amazing. After you read it you will look at the world differently. This book will put you in tears but will also make you smile and laugh and warm your heart.  I hope all you enjoy the book as much as me.
5," This book was truly amazing. As a young person in today's world, it is sometimes easy to miss the small gestures of love that others do for us. This book shows the beauty of those small gestures of love. The love that the 2 main characters shared in such a short amount of time is something that only a handful of us will be able to enjoy. Go and read this book. Totally worth it."
5," Absolutely and without a doubt, TFIOS is a stunning book. John Green has not ceased to amaze me with his remarkable talent. Don't hesitate to buy this book-- it will be one that will stick with you for a lifetime. Better yet, don't hesitate to buy any book that John Green wrote.I've already loaned my copy to my sister.Nerdfighters, my J Scribble is in purple.Also, DFTBA."
5, loved the fault in our stars because even if the words are writen on paper you feel that you are living hazels life. what i also loved about the book is that the cancer is there not to make fun of people or to make it into a cancer book but but to tell us that not all people are as lucky you are and that you should be happy with what you have got (or with what you dont have)
5," had very little interest in reading a book about teenagers with cancer, especially while on vacation.  Too depressing I thought, I'm too old to read a book about teenagers I thought.  I thought wrong.  This book was excellent.  I laughed out loud so many times and was able to actually relate to the characters.  I truly loved this book and look forward to reading it again.  ."
2," When you think about a book about teenagers dying of cancer, you are likely to assume it's not going to be a big pick-me-up.  But this beautiful, funny, heart-wrenching novel was one of the most visceral and up-lifting books I have read in years.  It's on my personal list of classics and one I would recommend to anyone looking for something to read with real depth and insight."
5," This is an absolutely precious story about a girl with cancer who finds love against all odds and stays through thick and thin. Real tearjerker throughout. As a young adult follower of John Green through his books and Youtube projects, I couldn't put this book down! Highly recommend to any young adult reader (great appeal to high schoolers) this and any other John Green novel."
5," couldn't put this book down!  Loved the characters and just overall enjoyed the story.  I envision reading this book again sometime in the near future.  I do think this book has the potential to get lots of hype then some people read it and don't understand why, so I'm glad I don't fall in the category. This was my first John Green book to read and I must read more from him."
5," This book is drop dead amazing. It has it all: love, humor, action, tragedy. It leads you down one path before shoving you down another. It captures a love story, never before chronicled.  I know it's shallow, but I have never cried so much and so hard as I did reading this. The characters are so well written they seem alive. The Mona Lisa of book's; right here in your hands."
5," tend buy books based on their cover art... needless to say I've read a lot of aweful books with beautiful covers... not this one.  Despite the fact that you know the sad truth about the protagonist from the get-go, it is a beautiful story of life and love, growing pains, and finding yourself.  I enjoyed reading every second of this book, even the parts I read through tears."
5," This book deserves more than five stars. It deserves a million. More than a million actually. It deserves a trillion or googooplex haha that's not even a number. The fault in our stars is the perfect mix between comedy, romance, and sadness. It's too perfect. I laughed and cried and now I'm very upset that the ending was so amazingly perfectly sad it was just... Extraordinary"
5, A great young adult read that can certainly be enjoyed by the not-so-young adult crowd.  Life is complex and these characters take on a tougher than usual coming of age experience.  A great read- although I found the characters to be a bit too sophisticated to be completely believable (hence 4 stars instead of 5) but still an enjoyable read for teenagers and adults.
5," This book made me feel so much. I felt like the Hazel and Augustus, Hazel's parents, Issac, and even Patrick from the support group were real people. That they had lives being lived out, and thought about. I felt so much for them by the end that I couldn't stop reading.This book has taught me so much about, not only myself, but about life too.I'd recommend it to anyone."
4," Everyone that has told me of this book was right. It shows the meaning of everything, that cancer is tough. That true love comes with a price. Even if it's not death, you pay a price for everything. I bet that after this rating, i will go and read the book 6 more times. As for anyone who didn't give this book adleast a 3star rating, well you my friend are a Peter Van Houten."
5, Simply loved this book! So beautifully written that I often stopped to marvel at how wonderful those words were together. Hazel and Augustus are smart and witty and young and even more alive than most people because they exist closer to death than most. John Green was able to write about pain in such a way that it was both joyful and more painful at the same time. Brilliant!
2," loved this book. I was a little worried when I chose it, because the 2 people I am closest to are terminally ill.  But, the book is touching, insightful and funny.  It made me laugh and cry.  It is not an intentional tear-jerker and it has some unpredictable moments.  It's a wonderful book for young adults and all adults. I look forward to reading John Green's other books."
5," don't have much to say about this book, except that it's absolutely amazing.  It is, in my opinion and in the opinion of many others, John's best book to date.  It's funny, sad, philosophical and amazingly emotional.  I sat down at my desk and stood up six hours later having finished the entire book without realizing how much time had gone by.  I can't recommend it enough."
5," This wonderful book is real life.  I laughed, cried and now that I've finished it, think about it constantly.  Thank you John Green!  You've given us an inside look at what so many people are actually going through and you've managed to show us all aspects through the characters.  I will recommend this to every one of my relatives and friends.Sandy, Buffalo, WY."
5," The dialogues, the characters and insights are believable. It's not sappy, although it has moments of sadness. John Green's word choices and phrases are sophisticated for the age group of his audience. I will read through his other works. I wish he would round out the characters of the parents. They seem like by-products or they are just there to make the mortgage payments."
5," read a lot...and have never written a review even though I tend to enjoy most of the books I read. This is the kind of book you can't put down, but at the same time you get angry that you are reading it so quickly because you want to enjoy it longer. I managed to read this book in a day and I know the next book I read will not even come close to being as good as this one."
5," purchased this in Kindle, but I didn't have enough time to read it, so I purchased the audio version so I could listen to it in my car. It was such a captivating story about terminally ill teenagers who have found true love.At the end of the audio version, there was an exclusive author with John Green himself which was an added bonus.A must read for everyone."
5," love this book like i haven't started reading it but i will tomorrow. Shipping was so fast came in 1 week after purchase. 1 thing i love about this is that its hardcover and was free shipping and really good price. Over at barnes and nobles i wouldn't want to pay 20+ dollars just to get it , so i got it online and it was way cheaper. I would recommend this book to teens."
5," This is not a book about cancer ;)This is a book about cancer as a side effect to everyday life and dealing with problems.  I loved the teenager angle, though I am 32, as it was wide open to new experiences and also cynical enough to make every situation humorous.I am buying this book for so many people in my life who know those dealing with cancer."
5, chose this rating because I honestly loved the book. Also the name has the word stars in it and why not give it more stars. I disliked the ending. why couldn't she have read the whole letter? it would have been more meaningful. I liked the love story. I have always loved love stories. This book should be read by hopeless a romantic too who likes sad and emotional books.
5," John Green captured the lives of two teenagers stricken with a side effect of life.  Through his story about Hazel and Augustus, it brought to light the unexpected turns that might inevitably face us and how living our lives as the two main characters did will at least offer happiness in the time we have with the ones we love.  I was deeply touched and inspired."
2," Not only is this book interesting, funny, thought-provoking, sad, all at the same time ... but John Green is a wonderful role model for kids, and shares ideas that help kids want to learn, to grow, and to make the world a better place.  This book is a wonderful teen read, but also a fantastic opportunty to see into the world of kids with cancer.  Just a fantastic book!!!"
5," ...until I finished the book. I usually like to pace myself so as to not abruptly leave a world that I've just entered. But I literally could not put this book down untll I had finished it 4 hours later. This book is heartbreakingly beautiful, but it is also much more. One but need read the first few pages in order to be pulled into this love story of an infinite nature."
5, John green is an absolute genius. I have read this book over and over again but it make me cry every single time. I own the paper version of this book too and I have forced 5 of my friends to read it. they all had the same response as I did... best book I've read in a while. it makes you think about what life really means and you will completely question your existence.
5," As a 43 year-old woman, I probably enjoyed this book more than the 15 year-old audience it is marketed toward at my local bookstore. I love that the author chooses to narrate the story as a female. It speaks the truth of terminal disease--even if no one is willing to say it in public. I laughed out loud &amp; cried (mocking myself for crying). I thoroughly enjoyed the book."
5, am fortunate the universe needed to be acknowledged this week and nudged this book into my existence.  Bittersweet morsels of literary genius are dancing around my brain and have adhered themselves to my heart.  Life is temporary but the richness of this book is infinite and I am a glutton for the punishment.  You should take this journey... be prepared for the scars.
5," This is one of the best books I have read in a really long time! I was laughing out loud, sometimes out in public, as I tend to read in restaurants if I am eating alone! Then there were other parts of the book that tears were streaming down my face. The characters are smart and funny. As I was reading, I found myself wanting to know them.  I highly recommend this book!"
5," After seeing this title on every Top Ten Recommended Teen Books list I came across, I decided I needed to read it.  I'm glad I did.  I loved the character development and snappy dialogue!  Chuckled out loud several times, cried several times.  I have recommended this book to many of my students.  Even my son read it and loved it!  Don't miss reading this one!"
5, Augustus a boy who needed a something after his something had been turned into nothing . Hazel a girl who didn't give a rat's ass. When they met Augustus fell. Hazel fell . Together they took down A self pitied author. Then Hazel's incorrigible Gus dies. After his something had been found. He left his something. And thus Giving Hazel a real view on how love first suck.
5, As I am writing this I am bawling my eyes out! Oh my goodness I am struggling for breath at the moment! I have never loved a character like I have loved hazel and Augustus. In the beginning I assumed the novel would be funny do to Hazels ever present sarcastic attitude but then Augustus was brought into the picture! I have been crying for the last hour over his death!
5," was very skeptical about this book before I read it because honestly the concept seemed kind of depressing. However, I gave into the hype of this story and absolutely fell in love. These characters are flawless and the story, as sad as it is, is also extremely happy. It's defiantly worth reading regardless of your age, its a love story that will steal anyones heart."
2, don't usually write reviews but here goes.This book wrapped me in from beginning.  I laughed out loud while falling in love with Hazel and Augustus' story ( that kiss in Anne Frank's house... OMG!!).  I truly loved Green's blunt sarcastic humor.  And of course I wept and wept and wept.Immediately starting to reread once done with this review.
5," fell in love with this book from the very beginning and never wanted to put it down. I was both laughing and crying my way through Augustus and Hazel's adventure, not at all what I was expecting from a cancer story. I've often found myself thinking back to the characters and the story days after I've finished the book, and that's the mark of something truly special."
5," read this book after seeing a lot about it in magazines and procuring a signed copy from Walmart. It was a fantastic story. I am a teenager and, from my perspective, everything written was very realistically from a teenagers perspective. All of the profound thoughts were simple and grounded. It made me cry! It is the type of book that I would share with my Augustus."
5," This book moved me to tears The author tried to put out a positive story of two young teenagers stricken with different forms of cancer,struggling to make sense of the world they live in. The effect their lives  and death will have on othersJohn Green story helped me with problems I have in my own life. I can't change them, but I can choose how I react to them."
5," The fact that John Green makes Hazel so truthful about everything is why I love this book. It doesn't shield you from the horrific things that take place in our world. This book helps you embrace them. It shows you to see things the way they really are and not throw a fit because of them. This book deserves endless applause but I leave you with one thing, Okay? Okay."
5," just finished this book and let me tell you it is the best thing I have ever read.I've never read any of John greens books before, but I've been told this is his best, but I'm going to read another because of this one being so amazingly awesome.I watch his crash course and other videos and I knew he had a creative mind, but I didn't think he could write this well."
5, This book simply took my breath away. I just reread the book and it struck me just as hard. It has a lot of controversial thoughts that I didn't know could be so well put. It may be different for other readers but I didn't feel the need to want to argue the points in the book in fact I agree with most of them. I would recommend it to anyone with the ability to read.
5," What a wonderful book! It may have been written for teenagers, but it was so well written and from the first page you are caught.  I laughed and cried. I couldn't put it down. I got my friends to get the book. My friends (we are not spring chickens, we are grammas) loved it! I'm planning on seeing the movie this week and can't wait to see how the movie was handled."
5, My best friend recommended this book to me and I didn't know what to except. Now it is one of my favorites. The plot moves quickly and there is never a dull moment. You will fall in love with these characters. The book is overall beautifully written. It is packed full of symbolism and metaphors. It is hard to forget. I wish there was a sequal.Okay?Okay.
5," This book was suggested to me by probably 6 different people, so I finally got around to reading it, begrudgingly. Now, I am NOT the type of person that cries when reading...movies, sure. Books? Nope. But this was a completely different story - I will warn you that I cried to the point of having a snot bubble I think, so be careful! But I still highly recommend it."
2," This book was one of my first serious books and it has left an lasting impression on me and it was an ease to read not because  it was written in a simple manner ,but because it was so well written and thought  out that I just flew thought it . I am 16 so relating the the character wasn't hard . This was the first book of yours I have read , but it won't be my last"
5,"m not one who reads the bestseller just because others do, but for once on a whim, I did. This book isn't your typical love story. It shows true struggles and teaches you to appreciate the people you have in your life. Hazel and Gus face the unthinkable together and they are truly blessed along their difficult journey. I definitely recommend this book for anyone."
5," know this book was on many best of lists last year, but I didn't have huge expectations for it.  I found that I actually had to put it down at one point and walk away because I felt like I was rushing through it too fast and it was so special that I wanted the experience to last.  It's a young adult book, but it thoroughly captivated this mid-30s woman!"
5," This isn't the typical teen romance novel. It is very smartly written, insightful, and honest. The dialogue would appeal most to those with a more dry sense of humor. This book, at times, says what many people are thinking but are too afraid to say out loud about grief and hardship. Overall though it is surprisingly not that depressing for the majority of the book."
5, This might have been the most saddest book I have ever read that is realistic fiction but I don't read very much realistic fiction butt this is a great book even though I cried and I have never finished a book so quickly because I could not put it down I finished in a day I couldn't stop I sat all  day even though it was beautiful outside and nice I LOVED IT!!!!!!
5," feel like Hazel myself wanting a sequel, wanting more to the story. This book was emotional, insightful, romantic, and gentle. I loved this book but I would say emotionally sensitive people should be on guard when reading this book. I also thought this book brought so much awareness to cancer and leukemia and how it effects people all over. 10 stars. Hands down."
5," This book is brilliantly written.  I switched between laughing and crying through the entire book. At one point I didn't want to continue on because I had fallen in love with the characters and wanted this moment to just freeze in time. But, alas, I  had to finish the journey with them and I'm glad I did.  I recommend this book 100%, just keep those tissues close."
5," This story was really beautifully written. With that said, it kind of feels like it was written to inspire its readers to kill themselves. It was like watching every season finale of Grey's Anatomy, reading the death scenes of Dumbledore and Hedwig and Fred and Lupin and Tonks and Colin Creevy, then getting kicked in the stomach.But, you know, in a good way."
5,"ve read it thru 5 times and some parts a dozen times.  One moment I'm laughing, the next I'm crying, a couple of times both - at the same time!  I will love and cherish Hazel Grace and Augustus as long as I live as I hope to read it at least once a year for the rest of my life.  Thank you, John Green, for this wonderful, beautiful book.  It truly stole my heart."
5," This book is amazing! I loved every minute of it. It made me smile, laugh, but mostly cry. It was so sweet and truthful. It's filled with so much honesty and love. It's so realistic and just amazingly sad. I can assure you that you will fall in love with this book and its characters. You will feel their love, pain, and sadness. You won't regret reading this book."
2," This book was superb--from start to finish. It was one of those books that you could not stop reading; not only because you wanted to know what would happen next, but because you felt as though you were walking with Hazel Grace and Augustus through every event they encountered. It was so genuine and raw, and that's what made it so beautiful. Definitely recommend!"
5," John Green is one of my favorite modern day writers. He captures so much truth in his stories and never fails to bring in something unexpected. This story is about cancer and he it seems as if he understands the horrors of illness personally. I recommend this book to anyone, especially if that person is going through a rough time. I hope my review helped.xx"
5," wouldn't have chosen this YA book for myself but I read it for a book club. To a woman we all loved this novel and recommend it for all ages. The characters are smart and brave, the dialog is intelligent and real, and the story moves along and brings you with it. This book got quite a bit of hype and made many Best lists, and it lives up to the hype."
5,"m an avid reader, and always have been. I read everything from biographies, and non-fiction, to kids books, classics, and of course the occasional teen read. This book blew my socks off. I literally could not put it down. I read it at work, I read it at home, I read it in public, I read it while commuting. It's brilliant. You will not regret reading this book."
5, This story delves into the deep waters of relationships and illness with sensitivity and clarity.  I would recommend it to any and all as any and all of us eventually experience the impact of the uncontrollable in our lives. The characters deal with their powerlessness and vulnerability with the strength and courage it takes to get through such days and nights.
5," Augustus Waters. He is amazed at Hazel's beauty even though she resembles his old girlfriend, who died from cancer. Gus and Hazel have this amazing love, that anyone would wish. They have their own infinity, even if it's for a short period of time. Their little infinity proves that even with a short period of time, we can all have a little infinity like theirs."
5," This book is full of meaning. Difficult to comprehend at points but answers so many questions I've never fully been able to put together myself. The thought process of this writer is so logical even with the most illogical questions/answers. Not exactly sure how to word it but despite having to search definitions of several words, the story makes so much since."
5, am 17 I do not cry a lot only when I feel lonely I didnt cry at my grandparents funerals but anyway the emotion in this book is conveyed in such a way it makes you stop Cry and think about it I became attached to Hazel Graze and her struggling story all I'm here to say is that this book is an amazing read and no thought should be taken just buy this damn book
5," This book is amazingly well written. I have never in my life gotten so emotionally connected to characters. And I cried for at least the last 20-30 pages.. No, I take that back. I didn't cry.. I sobbed quite violently. And I continued sobbing for a good half hour... And just thinking about it now I'm probably going to start sobbing again. Amazing. Just amazing."
5," This book is narrated by a girl who has cancer. She goes to a support group and meets and attractive guy who also has cancer. Though some parts of the book were predictable, I still enjoyed the book. The characters were quirky and interesting. It's a depressing book, but there's something that sets it apart from a lot of other cancer books I've read."
2," love this book and it always leaves me in tears. I though the first time I read this book I was under some spell everything seemed profound and it is profound.  I absolutely love this book as an adult, a hopeful romantic and as someone desiring to leave my mark in this world.Lastly, I simply love Augustus and hazel grace story. It should be read."
4," As a young woman who lost her first love too soon (to a drunk driver) and has recently been diagnosed with a chronic illness, I found this to be one of the most honest, genuine and emotionally raw books I have ever read. I laughed, cried, and finished the book with sadness, but more importantly a sense of hope and non-aloneness. Extremely well written as well."
5," enjoyed this book. It was my first John Green book and I read it on a whim. It was a pleasant surprise. At times you feel you may predict the outcome, but there are surprises. You should know the main characters are teenagers battling illness and experiencing their 'first love' at the same time. You will experience a range of emotions as their story unfolds."
5, loved this book! There are all these books people say are page turners and I could never find that in a book. Until I read this book it took me one day to read. I honestly couldn't stop reading it. I loved the first love romance and Augustus smoking but not smoking. Just over all a great book I will read this again and might just be one of my favorite books.
5," When I first read the reviews on this book, I was expecting a lot. After my final exams, I pulled out the book, and read it cover to cover in a day. By the end, I had laughed our loud, and then cried. The characters seem so real--it's like they're your friend too. This book makes you appreciate every day as you live it. It is one of my all time favorite books."
5," sat down to read this book yesterday, and was done by last night(although i did read though a class or two), and it was so phenomenal. I have said before that the only issues with any John Green book is that 1)They do not last long enough, and 2)They have a tendance to make me cry.This book is perfect, and though it had sad moments, is made me feel good."
5," saw the previous of the movie and decided to read the book.  John Green does a wonderful job expressing the raw emotions and the struggle many young people with cancer face.  I could not put this book down, I needed to know what was going to happen.  I would highly recommend this and warn you that you will both laugh and cry while reading this moving story."
5, started this book along with my fifteen year old granddaughter.  A challenge of sorts.  Knowing nothing of the story line I was pleasantly surprised when the words quickly drew me in.  The lives of those knowing they have a terminal illness and the ongoing thoughts of their disease reappearing over time was so beautifully told.  I greatly enjoyed this read.
5, 1. Read this book.2. Repeat Step 1 as often as needed.This is a book that I borrowed from a library because I wanted to see what all the hype was about. Then I had to have my own copy.  Keep in mind that this is a book written for younger audiences but that does not stop you from appreciating the great story and themes being presented.
5," <div class=a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block id=video-block-R32ULSRTU9TBQK></div><input class=video-url name= type=hidden value=http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/B14IvMGYEES.mp4/><input class=video-slate-img-url name= type=hidden value=http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81-v%2B0fZhTS.png/>The main characters in the book - Hazel &amp; Augustus - were captivating. The book deals with a tough subject (cancer in kids), exposes life in one of its rawest forms, yet celebrates our humanity &amp; individuality. The only negative part is that the book had to end!!Christine Brown-QuinnAuthor of Step Aside Super Woman"
2,m a picky reader. Its hard to find anythimg I can really indulge in. It was so interesting that I finished in two days. This book made me cry so much that my entire body shook. For a few days I was so depressed that my teacher suggested counseling. The ending was beautiful. Readers who enjoyed Stargirl and The Perks of Being a Wallflower will love this book.
4," started reading this book yesterday, and I've never been so caught up in a book and in it's story ever in my life! I really regret how I didn't read this any sooner, it's such a good story! It's can be very sad, the ending makes you wanna cry some more after discovering that *SPOILER ALERT* Gus died. It's something worth reading. Love it, love it, love it!"
5," LOVED this book.  John Green makes you love the characters right from the start.  They're smart and a little snarky sometimes.  They have interesting and real relationships and you just fall in love with each one of them.  Even the side characters.  The story is great too!  It made me laugh out loud, cry, and yearn to know more about their lives.  READ IT :)"
5,"nstead of making this story revolve around the cancer that these people had, John Green made the wise decision of making this a love story showing us that no matter how long we have with the person we love, any amount of infinity is well worth our time. We shouldn't waste our valuable and irreplaceable time together dwelling, we need to live in the moment."
5," This book was recommended to me and I dont usually go for the depressing story line. But there was a lot of rave about this book so I thought I would give it a go. I didnt connect with it at all, I found the teenage characters Gus &amp; Hazel unbelievable in their witty banter! Instead of heart warming it became annoying. Not sure how it became a 5 star read???"
5," This book is the only book to have ever made me cry. It has affected me somehow. Its weird.  Can not get over how this book left me with a feeling or happiness and sadness mixed together to make something so perfect. But oh wow Augustus Water is the most desirable character. He is sexy, smart, gentle. I shall cover be searching for him.  Such a sad tale but"
2," John Green is a genius and this book is absolutely beautiful. It is a startling and heartfelt story of two teens falling in love, in the midst of battling life threatening illnesses. Every page will have you clinging to the book for dear life as you lose the ability to can. Thank you, Mr. Green, for your literary contributions to the world.DFTBA"
5," Beautifully written, touching, and real. I finished this book last week and am still thinking about the characters daily. I'm glad  to have read this book, and look forward to reading more from this author in the future. I only hope that Green's other novels have the same depth of character and way of making me stop, think and be impacted as I move forward."
5," wanted to read the book before going to see the movie as I always do. Books are so much better than the movies. I think by reading the book first it makes the movies make more sense because you know what they leave out and what they change. It's also helps to know the story as the author wrote it. So I recommend this book. It's real, it's sad, it's life."
5," A coworker suggested this book to me and I loved it.  It was a quick read, but the story line is very cute.  In a quick summary, it's about a teenage girl who has cancer and falls in love for the first time in her life.  The boy she falls in love with also has cancer.  It is a very cute love story. Sad and humorous at the same time.  Quick, fantastic read!"
2," At first I did not want to read the book because the movie was coming out, but I realized that the movie coming out was my reason to read the book. I've read many books and this has to be my favorite. It has a mix of a love story and the tragedy of death by cancer. John Green did an AMAZING job. If all of his books are this great I will keep reading them."
5," Three months ago, I lost my three-year-old son to a rare brain tumor. Perhaps I read this book to connect with him on some level, or because the protagonists' families shared my struggles. Whatever may have motivated me, I feel grateful that I have. John Green has written an amazing book, full of real and smart dialogue and complex and likable characters."
5," This book makes you feel every emotion possible, to the point where you are left drained of everything you have left. It does everything quickly but feels longer than it really is, making it perfect. I would recommend this book to anyone who has lost their humanity, and wants to feel it again, or anyone who just wants a book that will force them to think."
5, This book is one of my all time favorites. It tells you so much about the feeling of being in love but is not cheesy like most love story's. It also is about cancer but yet again John green does not make this book fell like a cancer novel. Another one of my favorite books is anna and the french kiss. I recommend that book very much of you liked this book.
5," This book isn't really cheerful or happy, but it is beautifully somber and I think we need more books like this. As humans, we love happy ending and we don't really deal with pain or sadness unless we have too. This book addresses this along with an engaging story line. I have to be in a certain mood to read it, but I'm sure I'll read it again and again."
5," finished this, tears streaming down my face, in one day. This book will touch your heart and stay with you long after you turn the last page. The characters are complex, realistic, and loveable, and their battles are tender and touching. Even if you don't know anyone who has battled cancer, you'll appreciate the raw emoption that this disease conjures."
5," absolutely love this book and ever since I read looking for Alaska back when I was younger, I fell in love with the writings of John Green. Only a few years later I find that John Green has a youtube channel. Thus begins my obsession with Nerdfighteria. Buying this book will absolutely be the best choice and it comes with a community of awesome people."
5," While this isn't the worst book I've ever read, it certainly is far from the best. With all of the hype and acclaim surrounding this YA novel, I expected an emotionally charged tale; however, I found it to be a long-winded, predictable story that attempted to manipulate emotions instead of examine them. Basically, I was very disappointed with this book."
5,m not an eloquent writer or frequent novel reviewer but I wanted to say that this book was a very great read. It portrays a side of the ill that we don't often see but is probably more realistic than anything. It was touching (and I'm a sentimental person) while all at the same time allowing you to smile and laugh through their (main characters) pain.
5," What a wonderful and amazing book.  To look into the life of children who knew they were dying and having a sense of humor, the skill to know what a friend needs and the strength to do it.  Hazel and Gus are truely what love is all about.  I am a little scared of seeing the movie, nothing could top this.  Mr. Green,  Thank You for a most memorable book."
2," As the the late, great Augustus Waters said, My thoughts are stars that I cannot fathom info constellations.An  I completely agree. I cannot  possibly described  how much this  book has helped me, and how this author, the amazing John Green, has given me a new perspective on life.All I can say is, this is a book that will change your life."
5," just bought this book and this morning and finished it about 20 minutes ago. I'm not usually and emotional person or a crier (hoped I spelled that right lol!), but this book had me in tears. I'm still trying to get over it. I was beautifully written and the emotion was so raw and real. I'm not going to say too much more so I don't start crying again:)"
5," cried. If you have a heart of some kind you will cry too. Prepare for a great tear jerking, emotional beautiful work of art. I hate this book. It caused me to lose my body water through tears. This also coming from a person that cries at animal shelter commercials because they look so sad themselves. I recommend this book to everybody no matter what."
5,"t kind of made you want to think like Gus and Hazel. It made me as  that someone so honest and loving and funny and thoughtful wasn't able to make it to the end of the book, and had to go through what he did, and that he wasn't a real person that I was no to meet. The book mad  me want to try a  look at life differently because it could be worse. Okay"
5," thought it was intriguing because it was funny, sappy, and told a good romance. I am not one for romance but this one left its mark on me. It was so delightful! I would suggest that little readers read another book because some topics aren't for them. They wouldn't understand. Overall I give this book five stars and a bravo to the author, John Green!"
4," loved this novel by John Green. Especially, I loved Hazel Grace Lancaster, his 16-year-old narrator who is dying from cancer. That doesn't sound like a very upbeat premise for a novel, but Hazel's always funny view of the world makes it work beautifully. Hazel didn't expect to reach a ripe old age, but in the world of literature, she'll live forever."
5," chose five star because it is really sentimental. it's perfect for young adults who wanna read and LUV a love story. For age appropriateness I would recommend ages 14+. But they have to be really mature for there age. Read it, LUV it, comment it!!!  (Btw it's really emotional at some part so you'll need tissues) SORRY FOR THE SPOILER ALERT!!!! :) ;("
5," The Fault in Our Stars hits all the right notes. Despite being categorized as a YA book, it's for everyone.  I'm a 53 year-old man with cancer who can completely relate to the characters and their situation. As an author myself, I'm so jealous of what Green has achieved. The humor, pathos and love story work perfectly. Read it and you won't regret it."
5," honestly had heard a lot about the book from my best friend. I decided yesterday to start reading it and I fell in love. I honestly don't know how to explain this book. It's a perfectly unfortunate love story with so many plot twists. I don't think I'll ever look at the world the same. But that's the thing about books, they change the faults in you."
5,"ve been critical of certain elements in John Green's other books, but The Fault in Our Stars exceeds all expectations. Here you will find the same humor and insight that John is known for, but the material is more raw, the characters more rich, the goals more ambitious, and the payoff much more satisfying. This book moved me on a foundational level."
2," am not a common reader, but this book made me change my perspective in the reading life and real life. It's a true page turner and tear maker. No one should live life without reading this book. I would give more stars(infinite) but alas I'm only allowed 5...in the end read this book and re-read when you need a reminder of how life should be viewed."
5," Something I couldn't put down. As a high school history teacher I have used John Green 's crash course world/us history videos to differentiate my instruction, which has led my students to inform me of his literary works- well at least of this book.I read it and I couldn't stop. Lovely. Heartbreaking. Honest. Read it, you won't regret it."
5," This is not a book about death, or dying. This is a book about life, and hope.The two teenage main characters are forced to deal with the affliction of terminal cancer, yet still manage to allow themselves the joy of falling in love.Truly a beautiful book, and one that made me genuinely cry tears of both happiness and sadness."
4," Please read this. It's not that the world would be healed and all things made new if everyone just read it, it's that this book is so beautiful, really gem-like in the way it brings together the beauty and pain of being alive, that not reading it would mean missing out on something that makes our limited days on this planet more sweet and more vital."
5," am slightly similar to many of the characters. The humor is what truly pulled me in, as that is my humor. I fell in love with Gus' characteristics, and sobbed for about an hour when he died. This book is one of the best I have read in quite some time. I truly thought I had more to say, until I actually started writing this. All around a great book."
5," honestly have never cried so much while reading, but I didn't mind it. This book was amazing; I real the book in a matter of two days, mainly due to Mr green 's characters who grew so close to my heart I do not want to let go. I know a sequel would never work, but I do know that I intend to read all of this author's other works as soon as possible."
5, thoroughly enjoyed this book because it was a true love story with a twist that not all couples endure. The fact that both teens had their own cancer and Augustus seemed stronger at the beginning made it that more shocking when he passed. I recommend this book to anyone and it's a good book for either males or females which is usually hard to find.
5," love that this book is so real. In a genre (ya lit) that is suffocated with surreal post-apocalyptic and zombie/vampire fiction it was a welcome read. The way that the main characters are so fond of literature themselves just lights up my heart as I read. This was the best book I've read in awhile. I laughed, I cried (sometimes at the same time!)."
5, This book was absolutely amazing. It kept my insterest so well and I never wanted to put it down. John Green has written yet another amazing book that countless people will enjoy. This books makes it easy for the reader to really get interested and sucked into the character's lives. This book will make you feel more emotions than you knew you could.
5, The book has an exquisite arc of emotions for Hazel and I was pulled fully into the story.  You don't need to be a teen to enjoy this beautifully expressed account of Hazel's and her friends' struggles with cancer.  The story stayed with me long after I put it down.  I fully expect to see soon to be a major motion picture on future covers.
2," received this book for Christmas and was playing host for both of my book clubs in February.  I chose this book and had everyone in both groups read it.  People were calling and emailing me to thank me.  EVERYONE loved it!  It's a well-told story with characters who are witty, deep, and whom you care deeply for.  I recommend this book to everyone."
5," This was one of the most difficult, heart wrenching yet brilliantly told stories I've read in a very long time. I cried my way through a box of tissues while causing everyone sitting near me to question my sanity as I laughed out loud a few pages later. John Green's beautiful words are a true gift, and I will watch for more from this author eagerly."
5," From all the hype, I thought I would fall in love with John Green through this novel like everyone else. It gripped me throughout and to be completely honest, have never gotten to the point of uncontrollable tears that begin to fall onto my book. If you're an overly sensitive type, this book may be 336 pages of torture, but it's definitely worth it."
5," Really good book for any age. If there is anyone in your life with a chronic illness or an illness that is life-threatening, this book will help you understand the person better. It is also good that it describes teen relationships and the issues one may go through with a very serious health condition. This book focuses on relationships vs the ravishes of cancer."
5, Delivered as advertised.
5," As someone living with terminal cancer, I approached The Fault of Our Stars with the hope of finding meaning in how the characters face their illness.  If the novel is a cautionary tale, revealing how the main character is self-absorbed and self-pitying, and how we can choose a different path, such as the path of Augustus and his search for meaning, then I am happy to give this book 5 stars.  I was saddened and frustrated to see Hazel's self-pity, her sarcasm, her derision toward characters like Patrick, who are trying to be hopeful, her point-blank cruelty to her parents.  In her own revelation that yes, we are all going to die, she takes liberties with others' feelings and cannot seem to get beyond cancer sucks.  Does it?Directly after my cancer diagnosis, a friend who is a gifted pediatrician gave me a quote:  It is only what we think it is.  If this is true, then losing my hair is not a humiliation; it's a chance to see myself in a new light.  The skin rash associated with the chemotherapy is not a punishment; it's a badge of courage.  The tube I needed to drain fluid from my lung was not a burden, it was a friend, allowing me the chance to participate in my own treatment and envision the cancer cells flowing out.Hazel's approach is very different, and cancer is not a chance for forming a deeper relationship with herself.  It's a chance to lash out, to feel sorry for herself, and to think others, like Patrick, who leads the cancer survivor group, are weak and lame.  Green seems to not want us to like Patrick; he seems to want us to accept Hazel's assessment and to join with her in viewing him as out-of-touch.  But I like Patrick.  He is trying to make positive meaning out of his own circumstances.  Isn't that the journey of the hero?The book has other heroes:  Augustus and Hazel's parents.  Augustus is willing to be courageous, to face his cancer with the hope of making a difference for those he loves, and in this he succeeds.  His openness to using his cancer as a way of contemplating what comes next is also heroic.  Likewise, Hazel's parents have taken a courageous stand, showering their daughter with unconditional love and support, and also creating a new path for themselves in knowing that they will most likely lose Hazel.  How like Hazel to be surprised that her mother has been quietly forging her own path.  At least, to her credit, Hazel is happy and proud for her mother.  At least she is willing to acknowledge that others have feelings and hopes, and perhaps this small movement is her own heroic journey.  On the other hand, her treatment of Peter in their unlikely second meeting was abominable.  For most of the novel, she seems to enjoy casting herself in the role of the victim, and I can only read this as a message of a way of being to avoid, cancer or no cancer.This brings me to my question for Green.  In the end of the books, he recommends Cancer:  The Emperor of All Maladies for a further understanding of this disease.  My question is, knowing his characters as he does, does he think Augustus would go along with the title of this book:  that cancer is the emperor of all maladies?  Or would Augustus transcend this fear-mongering and grandiosity about cancer, and agree instead that the real emperor of all maladies is not cancer.  The real emperor of all maladies is fear, ignorance, and lack of compassion.My experience of Augustus is, he would not buy into the notion that cancer is the be-all to end-all license to be filled with self-absorption and self-pity.  Time and again, Augustus reveals a deeper understanding, not specifically of cancer but of life and the universe itself.  Even Hazel admits, this is person who would wonder, and enjoy wondering:  If I am playing basketball in heaven, does that imply a physical location of heaven containing physical basketballs?  That question and all it embodies is much more profound than accepting that cancer is the emperor.  As someone who has lived with terminal cancer for four years, I think Augustus' way of being offers a meaningful perspective."
5, bought this book because my mother HIGHLY recommended that I read it. I never ever listen to her but I thought okay let me just take her advice for once. So I bought it and I read it. I have to say that story in this book is just oh so generic and real boring. The plot twist was predictable and I had to really struggle to finish the book. I almost didn't. There were some very painful moments in this book but they immediately fell on their face due to the flat characters. Mostly fluffy fluff fluff. A real tear jerker for those with low IQ's. Sorry Mom.
5," read this book after having the whole thing literally paraphrased to me, in a very rapid almost frantic succession by my very deeply moved and apparently changed friend. He even cried a little while telling me about it. I having only heard of this piece once before, and then witnessing the emotional breakdown of my usually very put together male friend, decided that it sounded interesting, and that I would perhaps read this Oh so wonderful masterpiece by the regal and award winning John Green... But then, I decided against it as I had already been told the ending, and in all honesty, it sounded cliche. I can assure you now that my suspicions were correct.I was lent this book weeks after this whole incident on a whim by my cousin, who also seemed deeply touched at the reading of this book. She confided in me the emotions she felt as she read it, so I thought Why the frick not... Give it to me, I'll give it a try.I can tell you now, that with all the hype and excitement and crying made over this book, and now its supposedly amazing (I have not taken the time to see it.) motion picture, this book is not as great as I was expecting.It was relatively good, but in no way was it relatively great... The writing was nice at first, but as the dialogue continued, and the characters struggled, I slowly became numb... Teenagers, let alone most adults do not use philosophical pros and witty sarcastic banter to communicate. Though it did amuse me a lot if the time, when they did use teenager type language, I laughed out loud.The main male character enjoyable, but was too perfect for me, his only flaw being upset about dying and not leaving a mark on his world, which to me is not a flaw, as anybody would feel that.Hazel while supposed to be charming and intelligent, stayed flat the entire time. Her weeping father and the ever doting mother, the whimsical and too perfect interactions between every person... Everybody stayed mostly the same. Those characters that truly intrigued me such as Isaac were somehow skillfully avoided.The conflict of this story seems to be more of the dilemma of still being a virgin by age 17, than actually making a deep connection with other human beings....Besides that though, the description was good, and most of the literature while characters were not speaking was splendid. I also do appreciate the concept, it's interesting. The perspective on death is usually not discussed. It captivated me enough to read to the end, and the emotions portrayed in the circumstance of death were relatable. I just wish it could have been a little more realistic than an angelic boy swooping down to sweep a sick girl off her feet.Over all I give it three stars."
2,"m not much for emotional reads and just didn't think it was that great a read, I felt it was too hyped up before I actually read it."
5," knew of John (and Hank too) Green long before I knew he was an author from their videos on YouTube. So when I found out that he published books (and that one made it to a bestseller's list, to boot!), I knew I had to read it. I read it just in time to beat the movie coming out - and I'm so glad I did! I'm sure the movie is good since he himself gave it a thumbs up but I wonder how it could possibly compare to the novel???I don't often read Young Adult novels, but this was a very special case and I think it was worth the purchase, whether or not you're a Green fan. It's funny, awkward, emotional, and real. I recommend it to everyone - young or old, connected or not to cancer, even if you don't plan on seeing the movie. It's a beautiful tragedy that makes you feel good just to read it. So thank you, John Green!"
2, bought this book for my granddaughter per her request. Once she got it she couldn't put it down. I ordered the authors series after this &amp; she is now going to see the movie that just came out.
5," This book was recommended by a friend. It was a pretty good story, but I was expecting more out of it. It also uses a lot of cursing--just a warning to those who may be considering buying it. I am giving my copy to the person who requested it to me."
5,"m a fan of John Green (as a VlogBrother) but originally not as an author because I hadn't read his books. Then on Youtube he was telling everyone he was writing a new book (wasn't nearly finished, had no title, etc.) and through videos over those months he would talk about how the story was coming together and how he came up with a name TFiOS (as he would refer to it). Then he said anyone who pre-orders a copy, he will sign it — ever copy. (of which there were 1,000s to be signed it would turn out.Then there were tons of videos where he was signing copies, trying to get them all done by the deadline. I ordered mine about 6 months prior to release. It came in the mail once it was released, I looked at the signature, put it on my shelf. Remember: I was a fan of John Green, himself, not as an author so I didn't have a crazy urge to read it.Three or so months passed and I had nothing to do, saw this on my shelf and decided to pick it up and read it. I finished it a few days later and loved it. It's a YA novel and is written very well, with clever fast dialogue and is very funny at times - and heartfelt at others.After reading it, I would be in Barnes &amp; Noble from time to time and see it on the 'NEW' shelf, and then the 'TOP 10' shelf, and then the 'BEST SELLERS' shelf as time went on. I would tweet at John Green, thinking it was cool his book was doing so well. And then a couple years pass and BOOM! this is literally all you hear about. A new movie is coming out this week for it (with really great reviews) it's suddenly in everyones hands on the subway, and magazines feature the movie stars from TFiOS on the cover.It's actually pretty cool to see the entire creation of this book unfold over the years from a few pages being written, to blockbuster movie — happy I got to go on the journey, and I can't wait to see the film. Read the book (and subscribe to VlogBrothers on Youtube)"
2," read John Green's The Fault in Our Stars in a 48-hour span.  Wowza!  Not only does Green capture the adolescent thought processes, but also characterizes the young cancer patient's philosophy and outlook on living and dying with cancer.Hooked early on with the female protagonist's wit and outlook on life, I could not read enough from or about Hazel:I hadn't been in proper school in three years.  My parents were my two best friends.  My third best friend was an author who did not know I existed.  I was a fairly shy person- not the hand-raising type.  (12)'Pretty great,'  I agreed, although it wasn't, really.  It was kind of a boy movie.  I don't know why boys expect us to like boy movies.  We don't expect them to like girl movies.  (35)Augustus asked if I wanted to go with him to Support Group, but I was really tired from my busy day of Having Cancer, so I passed.  (125)Having been a cancer patient myself, I could relate to Hazel's commentary.  Furthermore, the intellectual banter which exists between Hazel and Augustus throughout is a delight to read as in their exploration of breakfast foods:'Like why don't we have curry for breakfast?' . . .'But why?' I asked.  'I mean, seriously:  How did scrambled eggs get stuck with breakfast exclusivity?  You can put bacon on a sandwich without anyone freaking out.  But the moment your sandwich has an egg, boom, it's a breakfast sandwich.'  (137)Thus, for the purposes of an evening book club over The Fault in Our Stars, step outside your comfort zone and offer breakfast for dinner."
5," The Fault in Our Stars is the memorable and moving story about a group of teens in a cancer discussion group and their valiant goal to leave a mark in this earth.  Hazel's father tells her I believe the universe wants to be noticed. I believe the universe is improbably biased towards consciousness, that it rewards intelligence in part because the universe enjoys its elegance being observed. Simply put, this is a book about the meaning and purpose of life, it is about the impact of our existence, our footprint in time. When Dick Clark of American Bandstand spoke about death, he said he wanted to live as long as he was relevant. This book is about the teens staring death in the face, knowing of it's impending arrival and the question of what was it all for. Both Hazel and Augustus suffer with some form of cancer, they have been robbed a joyous childhood, fun and games replaced by painful treatments and operations. Their lives revolve around the hard work of staying alive and the constant cheerleading from heart broken parents. They are bright and cynical, and understand each other. They fall in love and I don't want to say more, but the depth of their passion, the deep communion of their hearts made the characters come alive. This was a great book. I was not fond of the beginning,but Augustus tenacity won me over and the reader will fall in love with Gus's loyalty and companionship as deeply as Hazel. The ageless yearning of the characters made me forget that they were teens.Hazel wishes for a little infinity, the time to savor her budding love with Augustus, knowing instinctively it will end  too soon. The dehumanizing treatments strip the patients of their humanity, healthy people distancing from them, remembering only the person who existed before the treatments changed them. Together, Hazel and Augustus carve out a pocket of time to discover the sweet perfection of loving a person so much life seems meaningless with out them. Augustus complained,  I always thought my obituary would be in all the newspapers, that I'd have a story worth telling. I always had this suspicion that I was special. The Fault in Our Stars give a face to the victims of cancer. The story so insightful, the characters moving, yet without pity. This book reminds us that we are all here for a reason, no matter how much time we have, or what we accomplish, rich or poor, successful or not, that a rut in the road of life has been created with a lasting impression that will be there forever."
5," This is under the genre romance, but I wouldn't really call it a romance novel. When you read a romance novel you walk away with that 'ah, true love!' feeling. The relationship between the two main characters of the book helped moved forward the plot, but it was about so much more than that. I've been clinically depressed before, as hazel was, and I don't know if that influenced how powerful I found this book to be. On the surface, its a romance. But that's not what its really about. It's about how even though sadness and tragedy is inevitable we shouldn't let it hold us back from going out and living the life we want to live. One of my favorite books of all time, absolutely amazing."
5, positively absolutely totally freaking loved this amazing and wonderful book. One of the best books I have ever read!
5," What is reverence? Isn't it the acknowledgement of something true, something beautiful and real? I would argue that The Fault in Our Stars is abundantly reverent of reality, of fiction, of hopes and desires. I argue that it reverently memorializes the truth of illness with all its sarcastically viewed perks and disappointments. Maybe it's neither reverent nor irreverent. Maybe it's just there. Maybe the book's perceived meanings don't really mean anything to the universe; maybe this number one bestseller -- that made a crazy middle-aged man into everyone's favorite crazy middle-aged man -- is just another physical and intellectual filler of space. I, for one, reject that notion out of hand.Angela"
5," Before I give my reasons for not liking this book, I will admit, that I am well beyond the age that the YA novels target and am willing to admit that may have something to do with my dislike of this book.  That said, I thought that this book was poorly written, had little or no character development and read like it was written to be made into a movie (surprise!).  I thought that the conversations between the teenagers and their parents were so off base.  Overall,  I didn't like this book and wouldn't recommend it to anyone over 15 and would have to think twice about recommending it at all."
5, thought Haze and Gus sounded like pretentious jerks. Their personalities were similar. The dialogue was not realistic. The ending was predictable.
2," Absolutely awesomely amazing among other A words.  Hazel, while a sometimes depressing protagonist ably portrays what we all imagine a perpetually dying teenage girl feels.  Yes, she wants to get better.  Yes, she worries about her family.  But at the end of the day, she's still a person and so is Augustus.  At the end of the day, they want someone to love them and they want someone to love.  I liked everything about this book and I loved most of it.  If you haven't read it, then get on it already.5 Rolling Oxygen Tanks out of 5"
2,ncredible book. Truly touching and inspiring. I read the whole thing in a matter of hours. John Green- Thank you is not enough.
5," Such a rare and remarkable story that is both beautiful and devastating.  I sat down to start reading and kept going to the final page.  Green has created characters that will remain with readers for a lifetime.... a simple, tragic and wonderful read."
5," this book was perfect, it has the combination of comedy,love,charisma,tragedies,etc. i loved it and you will to you will find yourself laughing, crying and falling in love with this novel. in the begging you think about whats going to happen but towards the end its obvious what will happen, its just the way it was written sounded so real like i literately wanted to be their inside the book. im not much a reader but god this book is something else, the book is always better than the movie but no movie will be able to top this book! the characters, Hazel and Augustus are amazingly perfection they are so different but so alike they understand each other and even towards the tragedy they were the same funny and kind and loving. i really recommend this book you will not regret it. (i wished Augusts Waters was real !)"
5,"ve read only one other books by John Green, An Abundance of Katherine's. Now before I critique this, let me say I enjoyed both books, I don't adore them as some do, but I enjoyed them. john Green is a talented author.By the time I got my hands on this book (Four months of waiting can make you start to worship it) I had built it up to the best book in the world. I was disappointed. I was expecting to be at a constant shifting between awe and crying when I began this. I did tear up once or twice while reading, but it was at the end.This book has suffered from its amount of fame. However it is still worth reading, it's still very enjoyable."
5, A lot of people said this book was REALLY GOOD and I was really excited about reading it. I liked it but I thought it was going to be better. Honestly the best parts of the book were when that person died.
4," liked the book. It is hard not to like his book. The story reads fast and keeps moving. My problem was I felt midway through the story and characters became very predictable. The teenagers act with no mindset of any actual teenager.  Wise beyond their years?  I'm not sure. I don't think two 16-18 year olds are commonly so profound with just about everything they say.There are touching parts of the story where you see a relationship that exists based on a common connection most do not have, nor would they wish to have.To me this is an average easy read book, five stars are handed out left and right on Amazon. I would recommend this book and have no complaints on reading it, but my review reflects not just the readability and marketability."
3," Ok, this easily one of the better YA book I've ever read, and that probably makes me one of the 0.5% of readers in the world who likes Looking For Alaska more. Alright, probably more than that, but regardless, this novel is really good, regardless. Green has really developed his abilities, and he can tell some of the most original stories with terrific prose. His dialogue is endearing, his characters are beautiful. Augustus and Hazel are some of my favorite YA characters of all time, right up there with Green's other characters.My only gripes were the quirks with the characters. The reason Green is a genius to me is how he ties me emotionally with his female protagonists especially. I fell in love with Alaska Young and Lindsey Wells, and yearned for girlfriends like them. Even though Alaska was self-destructive, and way too wild for my taste, the fact that they were fictional and portrayed so tenderly, molded into girls I respected due to their intelligence, make me crush on them. Well, I didn't feel that with Hazel. I liked her, but imagining her as a cancer patient, with all those tubes and tanks, made me not yearn for her in the same way. Of course, her cancer is necessary for the story, and it makes her a great character, but I didn't connect as deeply with her.I still highly recommend this novel for readers of any age. You will, laugh and cry. You will yell and fall silent. And you will definitely read it again and again."
3," don't know, maybe it's just me, but after reading all the glowing reviews, I had expected better.  I found the characters a  underdeveloped, the dialog a bit too glib, the whole thing a little forced.  I don't know any teenagers who talk or act like these characters, cancer or not.  It wasn't bad; it just didn't live up to the hype in my opinion."
5," Leave it to Facebook to give me something else to do. Between Facebook and Pinterest, I can find things to fill up my day related to reading, cooking, arts and crafts, cleaning. . .The post that was shared and was probably viral for a few days was 16 Books to Read Before They Hit Theaters this Year and of course (Of Course!!!) I clicked. I was relieved - because all of a sudden, due to the title, I felt pressured to accomplish this task - that I had read at least a few including:  Dark Places and Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn (read before I started keeping track - they both would have been on the Debra's List of Books Worth Reading on Pinterest)  Unbroken by Laura Hillenbrand (that would have been on my Debra's List of Books NOT Worth Reading)This is the first of the books that looked interesting to me from the list but there are more, I warn you. . . The Fault in our Stars is a current day love story with elements classics like Romeo and Juliet but with a lot more realism. There are the teenage lovers and the tragedy but with a lot more to offer. As a parent, reading about very sick children (okay, teenagers) was often hard as this could be anyone's son or daughter and it just doesn't seem fair. However, the story was so well written and moving that I just had to continue. The book has many levels and is really an intelligent thought provoking book.Hazel Grace Lancaster, who narrates this story, is a survivor of Stage IV Cancer. She should have been dead a long time ago - her claim, not mine - but has been around an extra three years due to a miracle drug trial. She is alive but her quality of life is compromised. She is 16 and has to carry around oxygen as her lungs have survived a battle to survive. She is also clinically depressed and lives in a world that her peers can't really understand to relate to her.At a support group for kids with cancer, she meets Augustus Waters, a fellow survivor that has a sunnier outlook on life. At first Hazel thinks his more positive perspective is because he has a good chance to survive, unlike her temporary holding pattern that she knows will eventually end, but eventually she comes to understand that he has chosen to live his life in a different way than she has.Of course they fall in love and Hazel begins to see the good in the present day and how life can be cherished. Sounds sappy? It's really not and this book has a whole lot going on. Hazel shares with Augustus a book that she loves (An Imperial Affliction) that is a first person account of a little girl with cancer that ends abruptly and she's dying to know what happens to the girl and her family. Hazel identifies with the story and often imagines what her parents will do when she is gone. Augustus reaches out and arranges a journey for them to try and discover what happens and that is what makes this love story truly special.I think that this book is supposed to be young adult fiction but I think it was a wonderful book and worth reading."
2, LOVED THIS BOOK!!! John Green has created an amazingly thought provoking novel filled with characters you cannot help but connect with on a completely new level. Never has an author been able to inspire as high a level of heartbreak as Green has been able to when he wrote Hazel and Augustus's epic love story filled with amazing highs and tragically inspiring lows. The Fault in Our Stars is a truly beautiful book that Will have even the most stoic of readers a sobbing mess.
5," would say The Fault in Our Stars packs an emotional punch that is poignant, deep, sometimes funny, but still feels real. The humour was smart, sophisticated, and handled nicely -- it was enough to keep things from dragging too heavy. The emotions involved were difficult to convey in a way that didn't break the reader's resolve, but I felt it landed on the right side of powerful rather than the wrong side of depressing.I think Green did a good job with the subject matter, and the main characters of Hazel and Augustus had a chemistry that was fun. I felt it. The way they played off each other was cute. Maybe their attitude was a bit pretentious, but still undeniably fun. I didn't expect the sour but intellectual wit seen here, not from characters their age, and Green sure did use some pretty big words. I'm nearly 30 and I'm far from illiterate, but I found myself highlighting many words on my Kindle to look them up. That aside, these two characters were presented gracefully, and I appreciated their charisma throughout their time together.I'd call it skillful the way Green approached this delicate subject matter without petering into highly depressing territory. That's a risk you take, and for some readers, it probably was too much for them to take. But I wouldn't say I'm an overly emotional reader, so at least in my eyes, I felt it was handled well. I still don't think I was absolutely mesmerized by it, but it was a strong book from cover to cover.I won't apologize for not being blown away, because I'm not *required* to love it as much as others, and quite simply, it falls outside of the type of book I typically enjoy. I don't like sad or depressing. I don't like loss -- that's why I don't read non-fiction. I don't want to feel for real people. At least when I read lighthearted fiction, I know they are just characters and nothing more (which Green reminds us of) but even when there is no reality being relayed, still, I'd rather be entertained by a comedy or mystery than deal with tragedy or loss. But this book worked as well as I think it could have, for someone like me. That's a major compliment, even if it sounds like I'm unimpressed.This is my second Green book in a row. This was better than Looking for Alaska. Hazel was just a better narrative lead than Miles, and the chemistry between your lead characters is better here.I think based on what I said above, I'm not the type who will score this a 10/10 like some others. This type of book just isn't in my wheelhouse in order to achieve that sort of resonant impact. Was it more powerful than the type of book I typically read? Sure. But it's just not my genre, and so I don't approach it the same as others readers.The Fault in Our Stars was good, quite good in fact. It evoked as much reaction as I might typically have for a book I expected to be sad -- for a book I expected to be about dying, death, love, and loss. I have a hard time feeling for these types of books, because I'm not surrounded by enough sadness that I have some sort of visceral reaction to the material. Which I guess is a good thing, not to have loss or sadness weigh me down. But I'll wrap up before I go on another tangent: as far as 'highly recommended' books go, it met expectations well enough to earn an 8/10."
5, thought it would be better with all the high ratings. One of my big pet peeves was the unrealistic teenagers. I know a lot of teenagers and not one of them is that smart or witty. Not saying they aren't out there but to have two in the same story? I mean they sound like they are 40 year old literature teachers not 16 year old still growing their brain kids. Also as a Christian I was a little offended by the all the little comments that made it seem like the author/characters where saying that if you believe in God you are dumb. I get that people have different opinions and I respect that but to me it almost felt like this author is an atheist but still not 100% sure so he wants to convince everyone he is right by making it seem stupid and dumb to believe in anything else. I felt like she went on and on about how when you die you just end and that was more depressing to me than the fact the kids had cancer. Other than that it was an Okay book. One that is a pretty easy read but not so good that you can't put it down.
4," This book is unbelievably amazing!! I usually don't love reading books, and don't find them interesting, but TFIOS definitely changed my mind! This book is a well rounding mix of funny, tragic, romantic, and extremely sad. I definitely recommend this John Green masterpiece!!"
3," This book took hold of my hand on the first page. Lightly at first, but then its grip grew stronger. So strong that I have been left with impressions that may stay for a long while."
5,"m one of those girls that has read just about every teen/young adult novel out there, yet I have never been so moved by one single book before. John Green managed to right a book, not about cancer per say like so many people believe, but about the people who are affected by it. I connected immediately with both characters (Augustus and Hazel) because although they are suffering something extraordinary, they have love and life to deal with daily just like anyone else their age. I read this entire book in one night (11pm till 5am) only to be completely distraught and a crying mess afterward not necessarily because I was sad, but because I have never read a book where I have been so touched by the character's actions and words.For those of you that believe this book is pretentious, I feel sorry for you. This book has more meaning, importance, and culture than you ever will."
5," “Okay?” “Okay.” Augustus just had to make sure Hazel was alright. The Fault in Our Stars is a fiction novel written by John Green (best-selling author who also wrote Looking for Alaska). Hazel Lancaster and Augustus Waters are the two main characters in the book. Both of them had been diagnosed with cancer were sent to a support group and that brought them together. They fell in love almost instantly; however, it just wasn’t as simple as that. Hazel introduced Augustus to a book called An Imperial Affliction in which they both had adored, which ends up being a key aspect of the story. An Imperial Affliction ended up bringing the two lovebirds to Amsterdam. Bottom line: this is a tragic love story. I have to agree with Jodi Picoult (author of My Sister’s Keeper)’s quote: “Electric… Filled with staccato bursts of humor and tragedy.”  Prior to reading this book, quite a few people said the book was wonderful except it was sad and I might cry. I would call this a perfect book for teens as it uses some vocabulary familiar with many teens. I enjoyed most of the humor within the story, such as, “I've gotten really hot since you went blind” said by Hazel after her friend Isaac (Green 130). If this book had not contained the humor that it does, it would be a very sad story, sadder than it already is. Reading this escalated to spending almost all of my free time with this book in my hands and it was even hard to put it down sometimes. It just kept getting better and better. Whenever Hazel and Augustus were together everything was “okay.”"
5," Review: John Green has a reputation of writing the sort of books that are read by clingy, over-emotional females, and in fact I don't think I've ever heard his books being placed in a good, respectable context. Why is it so? I guess his books are shelved for hopeless romantics and can sometimes be paired with Nicholas Sparks' works (though it seems like a lot of people prefer John Green's writing over his).Either way, I think I found this book through someone's Instagram...and I believe the girl was one who didn't seem to read a lot, so when I spotted this in their photos I was intrigued. This was a popular teen read in 2012/2013, and I foolishly bought it because it seemed to be all the hype, without ever glancing at the backcover.  So when I sat down on the train to look it over, I slumped at the fact that it was actually about teenagers, cancer and love. The worst concoction of literary topics in a certain way, because you know that no matter what happens it will most likely be corny (if it involves teenagers), and most definitely depressing.This will be the last John Green book I'll read. It wasn't terrible, but maybe that's because I expected the worst? Hehe. It's a very easy read, so that's good. The weakest part was probably the writing. I understand it's shelved under youth but I found it to be trying to hard in many ways. The two main characters are the typical cardboard cutout-type of quirky, brilliant yet slightly socially inept teenagers. Never in my life have I actually come across these sorts of characters outside of the pages of a youth book, and that's where I found the writing to be unconvincing. Hazel is also an odd and inappropriate 16 year old whose brain and heart tell her two entirely different things despite her being oh-so-mature (but not really), and she falls in love with the typical mysterious and dashing boy. I didn't like the characters separately, and found them even harder to swallow as a couple. Bleh.I will say this -- the plotline was entertaining and I give credit to the author for it. I mean, it's hard to spice up a book that you know will end up with cancer doing something in the end.Some readers seem to have a love/hate relationship with this book because it's made them cry yet it's so beautiful (a concept I've never understood because if a book moves me strongly, I love it). Do not read it if you're looking for a proper book about characters that fight cancer rather than two star-crossed teenagers who fall in love while battling cancer. Those are two separate things. I'm not saying it's a bad read -- not at all. Is it engaging? Yes, I think so. Is it entertaining? Yes, I think so. Did it touch me? Yes. Would I give it to someone as an utterly life-changing book or Christmas present? Nope.Wrap up: I can see why people would fall for this book. I can see why people would quote the characters all over Tumblr and wish for their own relationship with an Augustus. It's a quick read, and I don't think it should be taken seriously (though the element of cancer as a life threat most certainly should be). I didn't find it absurdly depressing but apparently a lot of people think differently (I guess it's because I've read a couple of youth novels with cancer as a major element). All in all...it was lovely within its limits. I would recommend it to readers who are looking for a quick and light read that would make them think in a swift and effortless fashion. I didn't fall for this book though, the characters were unconvincing and too try hard. I wouldn't actually give this book to a 16 or 17 year old (or any teen in general) but if they were to pick it up on their own I don't think it would be a big crime. A refreshing take on fighting cancer without ever believing that the term fighting is the appropriate word. Read if you like. Don't take it too seriously."
5," There must have been some major keyboard mishap wherever this was published, because this was written by Holt McDougal, not this John Green guy. Holt astounds with this novel about the struggle to love in a life destined to end and he composes a symphony tugging on our heart strings. I have never been to a book signing before, but with such a masterfully written piece, I feel obligated to get the signature McSquiqqle. Hats off, a book that I assure you will all McDig."
5," have been a John Green fan for years, and I did enjoy this book, but there was something about it that did not feel sincere. It was well written and a very good story. I enjoyed it very much, but it felt like it was written with the intention to be something instead of just being something, if that makes sense. It felt a little forced in parts, but overall it was enjoyable. Definitely not Green's best novel, in my opinion, but still good nonetheless."
2," absolutely loved this book! I smile each time I pass it in the bookstore still... like it is an old friend. The story line is funny, heart wrenching and just plain endearing! We follow the two young adult characters Hazel and Augustus after they meet at a cancer support group as they both have had cancer. The two begin to fall in love.John Green reached out and touched my heart! I would recommend this book to someone else and this is one you buy... you will want to read it again and again!!!"
3," This book was an unexpected––but very definite––life changer. I'm in my mid-twenties, and wouldn't have otherwise picked up this book, but I had an obligation to do so, and I'm very glad I heeded it.Given that it's been almost two years since I read it, and its effects are still as vibrant today as they ever were - I can confidently attest that this book stands the test of time. Shortly after reading it, I wrote a little diary entry about my experience, which fairly-adequately conveys the emotions I experienced...It was late. It was a fairly warm evening for a January in Utah, dry, and still. The darkness outside was the kind you could almost smell. It was calm, silent, and the stars were so visible, it was almost as if the moon was calling for backup in order to light the city below.I was on the couch nearest the front window in my living room, and I had been there for about 7 hours that day – getting up only to eat and go to the bathroom, and when I ate, I brought the food right back onto the couch so I could continue to read. It had been such a long time since I was able to get so engrossed in a book. Let alone a fictional book, primarily geared toward an adolescent audience.And yet here I was, devouring page after page. I had a goal in mind, a bigger purpose for reading the book, otherwise I wouldn’t have spent all day reading it, let alone would I have justified breaking my 3-year-long “fast” from reading fiction. But as I read the last few chapters, the goal didn’t matter anymore. I was emotional. I was full of insights and perspective. And most of all, I was anxious to finish the book so I could go and speak with my wife.As I teared up, reading the last few lines of the book, I got up and began to look for my wife. She had been playing the drums for the better half of the day, and working on a video that she would be publishing the following morning. But almost by magic, she walked into the front room just as I decided to go looking for her.She saw the look in my eyes, and knew I needed her presence and full attention. I looked deeply into her eyes and gently placed my hand on her cheek. I could tell she was uncomfortable just enough at first, having been working on her video, it was a bit of an adjustment to pull herself completely into the moment. But it didn’t matter to me. Not then.I poured my heart to her, as tears streamed down my face. “I love you, Mari. It is such a privilege that I get to love you. How lucky am I that I get that opportunity?”As I expressed my heart’s intent openly, she began to open up. I’m intimately familiar with that look in her eyes, where her pupils begin to widen, her deep, dark brown retinas begin to blend with the shade of her pupils, and they glow. It’s a sweet feeling, swimming in a little sea of infinity. As the author John Green put it, some infinities are bigger than others. And this moment was our little infinity, stretching out beyond space and time, a connection that could not be penetrated by fear or shadows, or distracted by noise and excitement. This was love, and it was melting us in the moment. It felt like our ceremony on our wedding day, but so much more simple. This was raw authenticity, immersed in the honor and privilege of having the opportunity to love one another.I can't give all of the credit to the book, because I proactively created such a deep, integrated experience facilitated by the emotion the book inspired. But the feeling has never faded. Every day, I am thankful for the privilege of getting to love my wife. Whether she’s being a complete joy to be around, as we explore and experiment and create great things together and converse late into the night, or if she’s frustrating me, doubting herself and questioning her worth, letting her anger for the hurt in the world get the best of her – I just feel damn lucky and privileged to get to love her.I highly recommend you get this book, immerse yourself in it, and make manifest whatever emotions it may ignite within you."
5,"t was recommended that I read The Fault in Our Stars by one of my co-workers, and it was so wonderful that I read it all in one night! I was initially off-put by the idea of reading a book in which the main character was a teen with cancer, but the book drew me in with the protagonist's (Hazel) witty character and unique voice. As Hazel's relationship grew with others in the book (particularly with cancer-ridden teen, Augustus), I was curious to see how this love story would play out. A plot twist left me dumb-founded and in tears. The story was beautifully written, and the ending was tragic and intense. If you plan on reading this book (and you should!), make sure you keep a box of Kleenex near you."
5," was in the middle of reading another book and my granddaughter came home from her school library with this book.  I had read several reviews and had this book on my to be read someday in the far future when my tbr pile diminishes somewhat.  I was immensely enjoying my book I was reading.Okay, yes.  I read the book while it was here.  Had to.  This book is everything I ever read it was and so much more.  I still intend to purchase the book as there are numerous things I must write down as quotations and also because I must read this again, and again.  It is one of those.Love at first page.  Humor, incredible sadness.  Laughed out loud, sobbed.  What more could a book offer?  I understand this book is young adult, but read it, read it, read it.  And then read it again.  You will."
4," One of the best books  I have read, Very emotional. I would definitely recommend it to any reader. Just be ready for a lot of emotion."
5," Great author loved the book it's amazing !!! Very emotional , read the book on about 3 pick ups love it"
5," My daughter is reading this book and absolutely loved it, she read the book in 2 weeks! This was one of her summer reading choices for school and would recommend it to others to read."
5," Life is not fair; it never has been.  It never will be.  But life is what you make of it.  It is what you do with it.The Fault in Our Stars is about Hazel who has cancer.  She will never be cured; her life will just be prolonged.  Her life changes when she meets Gus, a cancer survivor.  Gus is full of life and reenergizes Hazel.Hazel's favorite book is An Imperial Affliction, and Gus comes to love it too.  The book's only flaw is it ends in mid-sentences.  Who would end a book like that?  Together Gus and Hazel seek out the author to discover the real ending.What I loved:* John Green does not sugar coat long-term suffering.  His details are sometimes too overwhelming.* Long-term suffering and friends.  Green pegged people's reactions to illness.  Most people disappear; most people cannot handle being the friend of a sick person.  Those that matter stick with you to the end.* The caregiver.  When people think about terminal very rarely do they think of the caregiver.  Is their whole life taking care of the ill, or is it something more?  Will they have a life after the ill is better/gone?* Gus.  He is a hilarious character full of life.  I can picture him driving in an abrupt stop-and-go manner with his prosthetic leg.* Van Houten.  He was a sad pathetic man.  Green does not sugar coat his pathetic state.  In fact I wavered between anger and pity.* Hazel.  I loved that she found life and the inner strength to go on.* John Green's accurate portrayal of characters.  I laughed.  I cried.  I lived through them.* Hope/support.  Though I long to be independent, I know that we cannot live life alone; we need each to survive.  I was happy that Hazel and Gus found each other to lean on.What I questioned:* Eternal hope.  Though I depend on other people to help me through tough times, no one can replace my God.  The comfort and trust I have in Him is nothing to compared to human comfort.  38 For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons,[k] neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, 39 neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord (Romans 8: 38-39)."
5," The dialogue is quite tedious. Everything is a metaphor and everything right down to the eggs you eat for breakfast has a deep and profound meaning. While I appreciate the effort, it just got to be too much for me. I felt like the characters were always trying to show off all the big and fancy words they know.My favorite character throughout the whole thing was Isaac, because he was the most... well, normal. He didn't talk in millions of metaphors or say things like breakfast exclusivity or existentially fraught free throws. He was honest and raw and if every character had been more like him, I would have love love loved this book.Now, don't get me wrong, I'm all for having an expansive vocabulary, however it gets old after a while of looking up the definition of word after word, and you quickly get tired of two sixteen-year-olds talking like the Queen of England.I do see, however, how this story got to be so popular. It's because of Tumblr. There is a very large part of Tumblr, which I try to avoid, that's filled with deep, meaningful, emotional quotes from poetry, books, and songs. This book fits right into that category; it's a hipster's wonderland. Think of all the glorious quotes you could take from this book! Just take a piece of paper and write down Why are you staring at me? Because you're beautiful, and then upload it to Tumblr.com and you've got an instant 30,000 notes.Okay, so, in all honesty, I don't hate this book as much as it may seem. I actually really loved it the first time I read it, and I will probably always like this book on some level, simply because of how much I loved it the first time, but it is not something I will read again.Read this book if you can manage to borrow it from a friend or something, but I wouldn't recommend purchasing your own copy to read for the first time in case you don't like it."
5," laughed and cried, sometimes at the same time.  John Green is brilliant and I would recommend this book to anyone."
2, Cancer is not an easy subject to write about but John Green deals with it honestly and with a bit of humor.  A very lovely book!
5," was skeptical when I first picked up The Fault in Our Stars.  The plot seemed a little cheesy to me--a dying girl trying to find a crazy author she likes.  I bought it because it was on so many Top Books for Teens lists.  I thought maybe it would be good for my tenth grade students, but surely I wouldn't like it.BUT... Before I knew it, I had fallen in love with Green's characters and was completely lost in the story.  I think John Green could write about anything and make it enamoring.  I have since read every one of his books and can't wait for him to write a new one.And in case you didn't know, a film version of The Fault in Our Stars is currently in the works.  So now's the time to read it!"
5," spent an entire year mentally preparing myself for The Fault in Our Stars. I read some terrible books, awesome books and your classic meh books. And whenever I'd go to decide which book I wanted to read next, I'd glance at The Fault in Our Stars' spine and simply turn my head away. To be completely honest, I don't think I have ever truly went out of my way to avoid a book like this and it's unlike me to do so. I usually tackle things head on, showing no fear, but with this book I had to approach things differently due to its subject matter. But then Jenn from The Bawdy Book Blog threw this in as a review suggestion, because obviously I needed some John Green edumacation. And I'm so happy someone finally pushed me to read this book because it did not disappoint. Well, not exactly...It's easy to see why John Green has the following he does. There is just something magical in the way he strings his sentences together that I can't help but admire it. It's simple, deep and humorous all at the same time. And the biggest thing I worried about when diving into this book was the sadness. You go into the book knowing the characters are terminal and I didn't know how I would fare connecting with a character, loving a character, to ultimately have them suffer and die. I'm a really easy crier and I don't like seeing people (fictional or real) suffer. But somehow John Green manages to take a cancer book and fill it with the sweetest memories.For a good portion of The Fault in Our Stars, I found myself chuckling at Hazel and Augustus' dry humor. The first half was generally light-hearted despite the grim situation the characters were in. Even when things got more serious, the humor was subtly there as a convenient ice-breaker of sorts. If I could describe it, I'd liken it to a grandparent making a joke about their impending death. It's awkward and uncomfortable, but oddly reassuring that it's possible to joke about something so morbid. Life goes on.The plot was simply ok for me, never wowing me or keeping me on the edge of my seat. It, at times, seemed to just float by with occasional things happening. There weren't many plot twists or ah ha! moments because you could tell from the beginning how it would end. You knew from the subject matter that it would be sad, and yet... I did not really cry. I did shed The Lonely Tear, but it wasn't for the characters. It was because of the situation they were in. It was because cancer sucks. Don't get me wrong, this is a beautifully written book, but the problem I ran into was the questionable authenticity of the protagonists. They never felt like teenagers. I get that they were intelligent and spent a lot more time contemplating life than your average teen, but they never felt real to me. Now, I'm not exactly a stranger to John Green himself. I religiously watch his history webshow on Youtube and I'm often amazed at this guy. But it was like he sat down and created mini-Despicable-Me-minon-like John Greens for this novel. They are all witty, super intelligent and too pretentious for their own good.Further, it was almost like Green relied on the severity of the ending and the character's intelligence to jar emotion from the reader. Clearly, this worked since two weeks after finishing, I cried while making pancakes just from thinking about Augustus' letter to Hazel. But again, this was not for the characters. It wasn't remotely similar or as powerful of an emotion that I'd felt after I read A Walk to Remember where I cried in my 8th grade English class under my desk. I'm talking about complete and utter sorrow for Landon and everyone else. DON'T JUDGE ME. :PAnyway, while I remain conflicted on how I feel about the characters, it doesn't negate the fact that this is a fabulous, smart read that I'd recommend to others.Reviews and more at Cuddlebuggery Book Blog!"
5," rarely give a book 5 stars, because nothing is perfect, right? This book is as close as it gets. The dialogue is amazing. I want to be like these teenagers. I want them to be my friends. They are amazing, in so, so many ways.My daughter forced me to read this book. I hadn't because of the hype (I tend to scoff at hype). She warned me that it was sad (I did NOT cry, however, but that's probably because I am a curmudgeon). It is. It is very sad. It is also joyous, brilliant and celebratory.This may be my favorite book of the year."
4," was so damn excited when i got the book! I was kind of afraid that it wouldn't live up to my hyped up expectations. But it did. The characters were so real. I love them, not just the main characters.It was hilarious, joyous and heart wrenching at the same time. The jokes do really make you laugh out. The thing about this book is its sort of like an emotional blackmail. I knew i would cry when i read the book. Sadly, being mentally prepared didn't help at all. I've cried while reading books before, a few tears here and there. But this is the first time that I actually bawled my eyes out. It's also the first time I've my heart broken by a book.  Approaching the end of the book, I was just so sad that i couldn't cried anymore.Even the characters are just fiction, they just felt so real that you can't help but feel for them. This was a really amazing read. My words aren't good enough. But seriously, you've gotta read it!"
5," After seeing so many people rave over The Fault In Our Stars I finally decided to take the chance on it and see what it was that had everyone so in love with the book. I have heard so much about it that I went into with a sort of preconceived notion as to what I was going to be given. I was almost completely wrong. I now understand why so many reviews seem to skim over what exactly is in it...and I feel like I should do the same. It's a book that you need to experience on your own to full appreciate and I don't want to rob anyone of that experience.The Fault In Our Stars is a book that deals with cancer, but Green has written it in such a way that you don't really feel that gloom and depression the way you would with a normal (what Hazel would call) 'cancer book'.  It's a book filled with hope, humor, snark, and sadness; and I don't see everyone who reads this reacting the same way. I've read very few books that have managed to make me laugh and then crush my heart with expert precision, but this is definitely one of them.When I first picked this up I wasn't sure if I was going to like it, the style and voice is rather distinctive and it definitely  didn't fit into the shape I had made in my head. Hazel has a very unique voice and personality, and it took some getting use to but once the story got moving I was hooked. The flow of the story is quick and I loved the realness of the conversations which are not perfect in form or generic. The conversations have character and you really can see their personalities hinging through in their wit and charm. The characters are really well developed and surprisingly I loved them all, and even though the cards are stacked against them I found myself rooting for them from the very beginning. If I had to choose one thing that I loved the most from this book, as impossible as that feels, I would go with the fact that it is not a book centered around death but instead it's centered around life. There is something really raw about the hope and love in this book and it just settled into my heart.The relationship between Hazel and Augustus is hard to explain. It's not a whirlwind romance and it's not some flat thing produced on a whim, it just feels real. There is a sort of unique bond that forms between them, and some of their conversations are my favorite parts.The Fault In Our Stars is not an easy book review and it's certainly not one I could accurately describe to someone quickly. I had so much trouble trying to find the right words while at the same time leaving out spoilers, and I still don't think I managed to quite capture it. It's my first John Green book but it certainly won't be my last"
5," am a self professed bookworm, but I am also a self professed non-crying bookworm. As in the only time I've ever cried during a book was at the end of Harry Potter 7 (and that was mostly to grieve for the end of my childhood).But this. THIS. The Fault in Our Stars by John Green. It's raw and beautiful and funny and profound and it has immediatelyshotuptooneofmytopbooksofalltime. OFALLTIME. I haven't read a good book in ages. And I mean ages, because in college I didn't have a lot of free time for leisure reading. And I mean good, because when I did have spare time, there was a lot of mediocre text my eyes unnecessarily wasted energy on.I'm obviously still riding the emotional rollercoaster (read: rambling), but I highly recommend this book. And I'm so serious about the laughter, because this author has got the snarky humor I love. And I'm also serious about the tears, because this book is about a terminally ill girl who unexpectedly falls in love. (What? It's a love story? YES SHUT UP, READ IT.)After I finished the book I continued to bawl my eyes out and obviously at that moment my sister barges in asking for a ruler and instead sees me pathetically crying on my bed. So through hiccupy sobs I give her my ruler and wave her away with some embarrassment. Yeah, whatever.Do I have to reiterate? Please read it, guys."
5," am at a complete loss of words in regards to this review. This is one of those books that I picked up because all of my friends thought I was completely insane for not reading it. In truth, I didn't want to read it because I knew that I would bawl and I was completely unprepared to bawl. I'm the avid reader out of all of my friends and all of the non-readers read it so my nerdy reader friends ganged up on me and threatened to burn my books if I didn't read it. Naturally, I relented because my books are my babies and burning them would be like ripping out my soul. Not really, but you get what I mean. Am I beyond happy that I read this book? Definitely, and I plan on checking out numerous other stories by Mr. Green, but am I so worried about writing a cohesive review that I'm babbling and trying to distract you from the fact that I'm still tearing up thinking about this amazing literature masterpiece? A thousand times yes. So, forgive me if this review does not reach my normal standards. It's hard to review a book that leaves you speechless because there truly are no words to describe the feelings and emotions that it instilled in you.To begin, John Green has perfected the art of unique characterization and connectivity. I had no problem connecting with Augustus or Hazel which, I believe, is why this was probably one of the most rickety emotional roller coaster rides I've been on in a while. Hazel has this really caustic, dry sense of humor that I tend to greatly enjoy in characters. However, hers was made all the more interesting because it was exhibited in such a unique and dire situation. She made an otherwise serious and overwhelmingly emotional tale full of surprising laughter and occasional smiles. At least, that was the first two thirds of the book because the last third was a killer. However, I'll get into that later.Augustus Waters deserves his own praise. My favorite aspect of young adult leading men is flaws. I love the flawed ones because they're real, they're not these perfect men that are unattainable in reality. They're doubly perfect because of their flaws. Somewhere in the world, such a person could exist and walk among us. It's characters like this that make reading worth while and, in my opinion, Augustus Waters is one of these characters. Once a star basketball player, he had to get a limb amputated from his cancer. In remission, he lived a life of metaphors with a big heart under his overly-confident exterior. Despite his ability to be highly romantic, the boy in him shines through his love of zombie video games and novels, but this also gives way to his obsession with helping others and going out as a savior instead of a victim. I have unlimited respect for this boy who always puts others before himself. The boy who puts a cigarette between his lips signifying the ability to kill, but refusing to light it to show that he has the heart to beat it. This boy is perfect because of his complexity, uniqueness, faults, and drive. It's funny to think that when I first met him in the story I couldn't pinpoint if he was an arrogant character who was all too aware of his good-looks or if he was putting up a front. It was neither, he's a boy with unbelievable depth who just so happens to be aware of the fact that he is gorgeous (both inside and out). I would read the book just for him. This guy is full of so much love and the romance in this one is real. It's not a silly little teenage love story--this is one that deserves to have a place in the real world. This is one of the first love interests in a while who, to me, seems human.The perfect romance aside, this book has a very serious undercurrent because it is a cancer story. I know a lot of people claim it isn't, my friends did, but this truly is one. It's just different than the usual cancer story because John Green was brutally honest. We get the whole shebang--the worry about the family once their gone, the journey to death, accepting ones fate, low points where the pain is so immense that they want to die, and the acknowledgement of cancer perks. These perks aren't just having your one Wish granted from the Genie Foundation, but being given a license after failing your driving test three times with your prosthetic leg because you got your right food amputated and can't do anything with your left. This perk is the free trip to Disney or boarding the plane first. The things that people do for the sick people. This book is real, and that's what makes it all the more heartbreaking. Green's amazing writing skill easily allows us to be caught up in Augustus and Hazel's relationship, their easy banter and worry in the first 2/3 of the book that when things get real, you almost forget that you're reading a cancer story. ALMOST being the key word. It quickly becomes abundantly clear that the story you predicted from page one has been lurking beneath the surface and it will all eventually come to light through a flood of tears, a barrage of tissues, and an infinite number of pleas for change alongside several of the characters. It's hard to make me cry, and this book has me tearing up just thinking about it two hours after completion.With that in thought, I want to caution that if you have a family member with cancer, I wouldn't recommend this story. It's heartbreaking to those of us who are fortunate enough not to go through such struggles ourselves, it'll be so much more intense for you.This is not the story for those looking for a happy-go-lucky story. At times it may seem that way, but it is so much more. The tears and torment are so worth it because the tale is so perfectly weaved. I know many feel cheated by the ending because the beginning of the book was so happy, especially for a cancer story, but again, this is a cancer story. If this was a happy story it would be known as a story of survival instead of a cancer story. Thinking that a cancer story is entirely happy is like going into Shakespeare's famous tragedy Hamlet hoping that Hamlet survives. If it's a tragedy and the character's name is the title, he is clearly going to die, just as a cancer story is clearly not going to be the happiest tale alive though it could be used as a vehicle to deliver uplifting stories of survival, love, trust, and perseverance. I truly think that John Green managed that in this one.Between the drunk yet well written and respected Peter Van Houten, Augustus Waters, Hazel, the newly blind Isaac, the ball-less Peter and all parents in this novel you will discover a cast that is easy to remember for their diversity, message, and perfect characterization. Green has easily proven himself as a literary genius and I eagerly await his other novels. It's not easy to make me cry, and as twisted as it is, I look forward to the novels that such an author can produce because the ability to make readers feel such strong emotions is something to be respected, envied, and praised in the YA writing industry. Green's characters may fear oblivion on Earth, but such a thing is nothing he will ever experience after producing a story like this.THE FAULT IN OUR STARS deserves infinite stars."
5," Seldom does one read a novel that is exactly where one is in life, but that's how THE FAULT IN OUR STARS hit me. I loved the narrator Hazel and her acceptance of where she was headed, her own death from thyroid cancer, but especially I loved the witty and lively Augustus. (John Green is having fun with us here since the title is taken from Julius Caesar and the line twisted to fit our main characters, all teen cancer survivors.)The Mid American setting never feels real to me, but once Gus and Hazel get their bucket wish and go to the Netherlands, the setting, characters, and story come together and dazzle the reader. I love the moment when they tour the Annex where Anne Frank hid until she and her family were arrested by the Nazis. Like Hazel and Augustus, Anne's fault was in her stars.Are Hazel, Augustus, and others from the group average teens? No. They're teens who have survived their first round with cancer and are living under few allusions about what happens next. They're sarcastic, witty, and well-read, or at least Hazel is. Green's adults all meld into one except Hazel's mom, who has ridden the roller coaster of her daughter's disease, so much suffering. When Mom asks Hazel the Question in ICU, Are you ready? The reader is one of the family and right there among them.To those who find fault with this book, I say the fault is in yourself and not in your stars. Thank you John Green for writing this."
5," initially bought this for my teenaged niece, as I had heard so many people raving about it.  I ended up reading it before wrapping it up (yes, I suppose that means she received a used gift...).  I actually just thought I'd skim a few pages, but ended up reading the whole thing in one sitting.  I loved Hazel and Gus and Isaac. They were cool and witty and clever in a way we all like to think we were at that age (but weren't).I won't rehash any plot points, as I'm sure countless others have done so.  I will say that I couldn't put this book down. The writing was engaging and the characters seemed authentic (if a little too cool to be teenagers, but that's what made me want to keep reading). I wanted to be friends with them!The writing style was very engaging for me.  John Green does a wonderful job writing about hope, loss, love.  This book made me smile, made me cry.  I was sad when it was over, and thought about the characters for a long while after I turned the last page.  That doesn't happen very often.  But perhaps the best recommendation for this book is the text I got from my niece at 2am Christmas morning.  It was a picture of the cover and it said, I'm obsessed with this book!"
2," laughed, I cried, I read it in a single sitting until 4.30am because I just couldn't stop.If you don't think you need this book in your life, you're wrong."
5, This novel is destined to be a classic of not only the Young Adult genre but in literature as a whole. It reaches out a grabs your soul and shakes you up and even days after finishing it you still feel affected. Huzzah John Green
5, love this book. It will make you laugh and cry and give you a better understanding of the world.
5," The C word.  Not the profane word, the other one.  The one that can affect your life forever whether you have it or someone close to you does.  Cancer is the main subject matter in The Fault In Our Stars.  I say subject matter, and not that it is what the book is about.  This book is about so much more than cancer.  In fact, I think it's an insult to this book for it be called the cancer book.  I've been a fan of the musical RENT since I was 10 years old.  It has always been labeled as the AIDS play even though just like this book, it's so much more than that.  The Fault In Our Stars tells the beautiful story of Hazel Grace Lancaster and Augustus Waters.The Fault In Our Stars has been on my radar for quite some time now.  I had noticed that majority of my friends on Goodreads who had read this book had given it 5 stars.  That is a rarity.  So I knew I just had to read this book.  And I just absolutely loved it from the very first chapter.  It's one of those books where you have the urge to skip to the last chapter because you want to know how it ends.  But you resist because you just can't spoil it for yourself.Hazel is the main character in this novel.  She is a sixteen year old living with cancer.  After her mother notices that she's not really living her life, she sends her to a cancer support group.  There she meets Augustus (Gus) a teeanger who is remission.  Now I had been told that this book was a real tear jerker, and to make sure I had tissues on hand.  And yes, it definitely is a tear jerker, but I wasn't expecting it to be so funny.  Both Hazel and Gus are extremely funny.  I laughed out loud numerous times while read this book.  The conversations between these two were just so amusing from the moment they met.  It didn't take much for me to fall for this couple.As your reading this book, you are just rooting for Hazel and Gus.  You want a happily ever after.  There was one particular moment while reading where I just wanted to take a bottle and somehow capture their feelings for each other.  That's how strongly I felt their love for one another.  I wish that every person in life could have a moment like that just once.I had butterflies the entire time I was reading.  There were so many theories running through my head as well.  As I said before I had been told the book was a tear jerker.  And I do not like crying because of a book.  Because it's just gut wrenching for me.  It's one of the reasons why I avoid Nicholas Sparks books.  But it'always those books that you remember.  It means that the author did their job for you have such a powerful emotion, and response to their characters.  John Green definitely did his job, and he did it correctly.  This book is just so beautifully written.  And in case you wondering I did indeed cry...a lot.Reviewed by Sana @ Step Into Fiction"
5," so, so, SO wanted to love this book.First, I heard about it EVERYwhere.  It had a lot of hype behind it which should have been my first hint that maybe I had higher expectations than I should have.Second, the whole teenager with cancer is a long time love of mine in books since I grew up reading Lurlene McDaniel books.And lastly, the cover of the book is gorgeous.  Not to judge a book by it's cover, but this is a very pretty book sitting on my bookshelf.All that said, I didn't love the book.  I'd say I liked it.  I liked it enough to finish it.  Or maybe I was just curious or hopeful that the story would get better?  Either way, it never really did for me.My biggest issue was that I had the hardest time believing the story line.  The author never made me feel like I really believed what was happening or that these characters existed.  Maybe there was a point to that?  Maybe if I over analyzed the book I could see more to it than that.  But really, when it came down to it, I just didn't buy it.  At all.  And I wanted to.I did like the book.  I did enjoy parts of it.  Which is why I gave it three stars.  I think had the author just toned down the whatever it was that made those characters seem so fake to me, then I would have loved the book.  Unfortunately, there was just something missing for me."
5," There is love, then there is LOVE. What appeared to me as LOVE when I was a teenager was a complete sacrifice of everything I had to the one I loved. This is something that I didn't find in this book, and it made me sad, because it is absolutely beautifully written, but that pain that pierced me when I was 16? I didn't feel it. Two teenagers who have cancer fall in love, and I kept waiting for it to turn into LOVE, but it didn't. For me. So don't listen to me and read it for yourself, it seems to be a very popular book right now. As for me... if you're curious to read why I gave it only 3 stars, proceed with caution.Hazel, a 16 year old teenager, meets Augustus, another teenager, at a cancer support group meeting, and what ensues is a remarkably well written sharp exchange of smart adolescent pun, sarcasm, attempts at understanding the infinity, the universe, and how it all can possibly fit into the picture of life. Life of someone who has cancer. It can't. It won't. But they still live it and manage to make the best of it, through friendship, through reading each other's books, playing computer games and the like, the typical teenage stuff. That is, they try to make it typical, because it simply can't be. Not when you have cancer. And here is where I have nothing else to say, because as much as I tried, I couldn't relate to the characters beyond a simple observation. I didn't cry over it like I cried over THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER. I didn't believe it. The parents were all supportive, too good to be true. Everyone, in fact, was so very supportive, that it had a bit of an aftertaste of... I don't know, I'm trying to , but I'm not buying it.There. Still. Read it. I bet you'll like it. But it was definitely not my book. I'd rather stick my nose back into CARRIE."
3,"m a grown parent of a preteen and I've never heard of John Green. In fact, I didn't even glance at the author's name on the cover, and when I got done, I was shocked to read the author's bio and find out he was a man. That is how well I feel Green captured the voice inside a teenage girl's head. I'm also not ashamed to admit I, like the narrator, instantly had a massive crush on Gus, the male half of the teen couple who meet in a cancer support group. While you do have to suspend disbelief a bit to buy that there are not two, but three (including Gus's best friend) kids with the same dry wit and intelligence in the same group who all find each other, it was worth it. I read this book in one night, not putting it down (except to reach for the Kleenex so I could wipe off the tears and snot so I could see to keep reading). This book is funny, sad, takes unexpected turns, and all of the characters are well drawn, including the parents. I also appreciated that it didn't get heavy into sex (SPOILER: the two do have sex, but it is implied, not described). I put off reading this book out of fear it would be too painfully sad, but I'm so glad I did read it. I would recommend this for age 14 and up or maybe mature 13 year olds."
3,"ve read this book 3 times now. Twice via ebook and now once via my very own physical copy of the collector's edition. A little part of me had hoped for a personal John Green signature but the little surprise under the cover is good enough for me.I've seen reviews that claim Hazel and Augustus aren't believable as teenagers and all that jazz, and if it weren't for the fact that they're kids with terminal illnesses, one of them being very into literature, I might agree. Terminal illnesses make you grow up a little faster. Besides in very young children, this is almost always the case. And from personal experience with teenagers (my best friend happens to have just turned 18 in February), they are, without a doubt, believable characters. Even the way they text each other is so incredibly familiar to me. Augustus texts Hazel multiple times in a row, sometimes in all caps without punctuation, and it's exactly like I text others when my emotions are running rampant.I've read this book 3 times and I've cried every time. I've also laughed every time. It doesn't lose its humor after the first read and it definitely doesn't lose its knack for evoking tears from my eyeballs.I want this book to be read by everybody and I want everybody to love it. It's truly an easy read. It's not filled with ambiguous metaphors that are impossible to decipher. It's just so real and so light and so incredibly emotional on all parts of the spectrum and it is truly a great book.I call it John Green's second best work because I can't possibly get over my love for his book Paper Towns. But in actuality, TFIOS probably ties for first. It's just really hard to make that decision so I just choose not to."
4," loved this book and I'm recommending it to everyone! Hazel meets Augustus at a cancer support group - as two teenagers they don't expect to have much life and as the roll call is read, they see their future in early death. With such a premise, this could be a depressing book, but it's more about a triumph of love and living despite the threat of death hanging over our heads. There are some wonderful discussions on the meaning of disease and dying and through Hazel's eyes we get to understand a little of their experience. This book is needed and although Green is a YA author, I think all ages would benefit from reading it. Beautiful, harrowing, special. Thanks John."
5, A great book - and not just for the YA audience it is aimed at.  A great quick read with something for everyone.
2," had high hopes for this book, based on all the reviews, but for some reason I never really got emotionally attached to the characters.  They didn't seem real to me for some reason.  So, all the sad parts were sad, but not tear worthy!"
5," Although the main characters are young adults who are facing cancer, John Green manages to give the reader an abundance of laughs. Very well-developed characters who deal with their illnesses through humor and by relying on each other."
2, am in my fifties and read a variety of books. Dont think this book is limited to teens. The book did what I want a book to do. Get me hooked on the characters and what is happening in their lives so I want to keep turning the pages.  The writing is smart and clever. I will look for other books by this author.
4," bought this book to pass the time on a recent trip.  While traveling, I typically buy books for my Kindle that both I and my 20-year-old daughter will like.  This one seemed to fit the bill:  Teen love and teen angst for her and relatively positive reviews for me.  It was not a terrible book, although both my daughter and I decided we could easily have just read the first and last pages.  It was completely predictable.  The unrealistic banter between the 2 teenage protagonists felt sort of contrived, but that seems to be the fashion in teen literature these days, so I was hip with it."
5," finished this book in one sitting. When a friend suggested I read it, it was purchased but I had not gotten to it yet. And now I wish I had sooner. The story quickly sucks you in. You are introduced to people who I honestly believe will forever been in your heart and mind. They feel more real than any others you may read about. The quoting of the last two lines of the Robert Frost poem brought a smile to my face and a tug at my heart.Nothing Gold Can Stayby Robert FrostNature's first green is gold,Her hardest hue to hold.Her early leaf's a flower;But only so an hour.Then leaf subsides to leaf.So Eden sank to grief,So dawn goes down to day.Nothing gold can stay."
3," Where do I even begin with this book? I was really excited, but at the same time a bit nervous, to begin reading this book. I was not prepared for an emotional roller coaster such as this one. Young love determined to blossom despite the nasty disease that should stop it.Spoilers Ahead!!Let's start with Isaac because I honestly loved his character despite how minor he was. His whole being was determined to find true love despite the cards he was dealt in life; one could say he was blinded by the desire to have it (no pun intended). For a second he even thought he had until it was ripped from him like his remaining eye. He was more devastated over the loss of a girl more so than his own eye which allowed him to see the beauty of the world, but then again, his world was collapsing like any other teenage boy's by losing who they thought was the love of their life so at that point, he was a normal boy without cancer.Let's move on to Hazel. At first, I didn't care much for her. I really have no reason why I didn't like her other than my own fear of bonding to this character and expecting her to die in the end and rip me to shreds like any other time a character dies that I like. By the middle though, I couldn't help but love and sympathize for Hazel. I really got upset over Peter's treatment towards her even though he had lost a daughter that she reminded him of so much, it still didn't excuse his behavior. Hazel was very mature for her age and I hate that the cancer did that to her because it also made her apathetic towards life and I really wanted her to be happy especially after meeting Augustus but what did I expect reading a book about teenagers with cancer?So that brings me to Augustus Gus Waters. The knight in shining armor in my opinion. A character you couldn't help but adore and love especially when he gave up his Wish to fly his non-girlfriend, and later girlfriend, to Amsterdam to meet her favorite author. The boy that fought so hard to get her to fall in love with him while in remission to just have it all ripped from him by finding out that once again, he had to battle for life that he was destined to lose. Which he did lose and which broke me to pieces.I never once expected it would be Augustus who died in the end, I always thought it was Hazel but John Green has a way of turning the tables on you and making me assume one thing and throws something else your way. But at the same time, I wouldn't have it any other way. I didn't want to read a book that was so... cliché. I wanted to read something a bit different and would surprise me and this definitely did. All in all, this is one of my favorite books now, I recommend it to everyone, and I have been touched in an indescribable way and it will never leave me."
5," Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters:  fated to meet, match wits, navigate love and literary odyssey, avenge injustice and generally suck the marrow out of life while they can, just as they are fated not to linger overlong on this earth.They meet at painfully earnest teen cancer survivors' Support Group (where fellow teenaged cancer survivors, morose or maniacally upbeat or something in-between, gather in a tiresome mantra-and-proverb-laced circle to listen to their leader's weekly iteration of his own survival and ball-lessness and share with one another their triumphs and struggles). Both have lost parts of themselves to the disease. Each uses a keen and pliant intellect and an old soul to full advantage, even as their bodies continue to betray them.  As they battle internal and external malignancies, hijacking each other's lives and dreams while their roller coaster car speeds inexorably to its apex (read the book), Augustus and Hazel try to answer the unanswerable, hold onto slim hope while seeking graceful--or at least acceptable--exit for the sake of those they love, and find truth and meaning in whatever time they have, leaving a positive force in a scarred universe, even if they can't, as Augustus writes, pull their stars into constellations.  This is a story concerning two young adults with cancer, but, miraculously, it is NOT a book about people with cancer.  Sarcastic, romantic, wildly clever, shining, even funny, it's a starry night above a wounded landscape. Someday, it--we--will all be once was, void, forgotten.  But for now, we are."
5," This is my first time reading a John Green book and all I could do was be so engrossed in his storytelling, it's truly captivating and riveting work.  All the characters are beautifully written and wow the romance between Hazel and Gus is probably one the best couples I've EVER read in print.  The chemistry those two share is beyond special -- they are realistic and perfectly matched.  Not to mention, TFIOS is more than just a fictionalize depressing cancer read, but it takes the issue a step farther showing not everyone who has a life threatening cancer are not simply waiting around to die, but there are actually people who keep enjoying their life, even when all hope is probably lost.  That's why I love the Gus character so much, besides the fact he's charming, funny, and charisma for days, he never let his cancer get the best of him.  Same can definitely be said for Hazel too.All I have to say is: BUY THIS BOOK!  You won't be disappointed one bit by this story.  And when you do read it make sure have the tissues on deck.  I'm not much of a crier of books, but thanks to John Green's profound writing, I shedded a few tears.  He simply nails it!"
5," This book has humor, philosophy,love,and tragedy. This book made me cry and laugh; I just loved it. I recommend it to anyone."
5," This book was so not what I expected at all. I'd seen it mentioned a lot this year, but after reading the Goodreads description, I was unimpressed. It just didn't sound appealing to me at all. But then came a lot of End of Year Surveys and Top Ten Books of 2012, and I saw this book all over the place. I figured for it to be getting that much love, it had to be better than it sounded, and I decided to give it a chance.From the very beginning, the first couple pages, it was clear to me that I really, really liked Hazel. Even though she is terminally ill with cancer, she has a sense of humor that can't be beat. I found myself chuckling a lot at things that came out of her mouth, and I found myself often forgetting that she was, in fact, sick, until the next mention of her cannula came up.Augustus was easily my favorite character. He was just so swoon-worthy and romantic, but also hilarious and sarcastic. From the start, I really liked his interaction with Hazel. They just had a relationship that was so believable but still really enjoyable to read. I never found myself rolling my eyes or getting aggravated with them. I really loved their chemistry.There was a twist at the end that while I sort of saw it coming, it wasn't blatantly predictable, and I liked it. It changed the way I expected the story to go, which was nice. I am also glad that a prediction I made for the ending did not come true. I definitely thought it was foreshadowed and would not have been happy with it, so I'm glad that it didn't happen the way I thought it would.I did find myself with some questions left over at the end of the story, but I think that that was realistic. The whole story was very realistic, and in life, you don't always get the answers you want, and you don't always get a happy ending. I thought that was appropriate here.Overall, I really, really loved this book. It was so beautifully written, a realistic look at the way cancer affects people's lives. I found my heart going out to the characters for their struggles, but moreso loving how they continued to live their lives and not let their cancer define them. I would definitely recommend that everybody read this book, and I will definitely be reading more John Green. I easily give it 5 stars!"
2," am a college student. I read textbooks. I can't tell you when the last time I read for fun was. I received this book from a friend as a Christmas gift. My friend knows that it takes a lot for a book to impress me. I had no idea what The Fault in Our Stars was about. I started reading this book and throughout the first five chapters I found myself laughing and crying at the same time. I was happy and sad at the same time about two fictional characters, dealing with the deadly disease of cancer, falling in love. I have laughed at books and I have cried at books but I have not laughed and cried at a book at the same time. John Green was so descriptive about every detail. When Hazel and Gus were in Amsterdam on their dinner date, I could picture in my mind exactly what the scene looked like. After Gus told Hazel his cancer came back and those chapters when you knew he was dying, I sobbed. You don't know what you have until it's gone. The truth is Hazel knew what she had she just never thought she'd lose it...I have heard rumblings of this book becoming a movie and God, I pray that it doesn't become a film. My Sister's Keeper is my favorite book, ever. I saw the movie and seriously was distraught at how much it changed. The Fault in Our Stars is too great of a book to be tampered with."
5," Who would have thought that one could write about teenagers with terminal cancer and make it entertaining and witty.  This author got it spot on.  It was very well written in a lighthearted way that made it a very entertaining read.  I did shed a tear at the beginning of chapter 21, and I defy anyone not to, but overall it was not a depressing book, despite the subject matter.  The three main characters, Hazel, Augustus and Isaac were just trying to live their lives as best they could despite their awful diagnoses.  They made me realise that people with cancer are still people as well and should not be defined by their cancer.  I am guilty of avoiding the elephant in the room when I see a child that has cancer and trying to avoid them rather than have to face the issue or them as a person.  I hope that reading this book will change that.I have dropped a star from the book as the character of Peter Van Houten was very annoying.  I realise that he was supposed to be a *** and very annoying but I felt the author went slightly overboard on getting that point across.  It was apparent early on and he did not need to labour the fact with some of the pretentiousness that was included.  It got so much at one point that I felt that the author was trying to get across how clever he, himself was rather than the character of Van Houten.I also dropped another star as I thought the ending was not tragic enough.  Difficult to explain why without giving away a spoiler but I really wanted it to end the way the fictional book (mentioned throughout) AnImperial Affliction ended!  I thought that would have been a more dramatic and poignant ending.Despite only getting 3 stars from me, it was a good read and one I will definitely pass onto someone."
5," Perhaps, these days, the most important quality I assign to a book, especially a novel, is the emotional effect it has on me. Also important are the quality of the dialogue, particularly when it's a significant part of the book, the originality of the story, the sense I get of the realness, the humanness, of the characters. Considering all of that, John Green's novel, The Fault in Our Stars, is extraordinary.I've seen some assignment of the book to the 'young adult' category of book types. I disagree with that designation, though the book could be read, understood and appreciated by teenagers. (A look at the ages, or references, of many reviewers at amazon.com demonstrates the story's appeal to that reading group.)A story most focused on two teenagers with cancer, they and other characters speak mature universal insights and realities about life, living with cancer, mortality shortened, the emotional stumbling and navigation of all intimately involved characters--parents, other adults, friends, other teens, this book contains so much and gives so much to and for its readers. (As a nurse I have some knowledge and understanding of the severe illness and dying processes.)I read this book in pieces; I couldn't have read it in a couple or three sittings. It's emotional forces--teens with deadly cancer, its humor--gallows and otherwise--the gut-wrenching pain, the development of love between two people knowing of their potential short futures--wouldn't allow me to read this special and amazingly well-written and compassionate story.For me, The Fault of Our Stars lived up to and surpassed its billing, its hype, if you will. For the complete, compelling and surpassing quality of the story, I score it five stars."
3," confess I'd never heard of John Green but the plot seemed intriguing so I bought the book.  I wanted to love it, like the 5-starred readers did.  But I didn't ever find myself relating to the characters.  I found myself wanting to know the backstory of the main characters' illnesses.  To understand more what experiencing their deathly diseases was like.  What was it like when they were diagnosed?  The reaction of the parents.  The reaction of the kids.  The reaction of their friends.I guess I was looking for more substance.  Like  what I'd find in a Jodi Piccault novel. Instead, all that I had expected was replaced by a peek at Augustus' sisters and kids, Hazel's girlfriend and Van Hauten.  They were so quickly introduced and then gone (except maybe for Van Hauten) I felt they brought no relevance to the story.  Van Hauten's first appearance made sense but once with him was enough.  His second appearance was totally implausible.I'm 61 and I know this a YA book.  Maybe that is my problem..."
5," This was one of the best books I have read. It was not what I had expected even though I read many reviews on different websites. Despite being sad and depressing, this book is full of hope, which made it so beautiful. It made me laugh and cry at the same time. If only all of us were so lucky to find a Gus in our lives, the world would be a much happier place."
3," When my niece recommended that I read The Fault in Our Stars I was intrigued by her conviction that it was fantastic and yet I was apprehensive about the subject matter.  A book about cancer cannot be anything but sad - can it? Now that I have read it I would just like to clarify that this is NOT a book about cancer; it is a story about teenagers who are living with cancer.It is touching, funny, endearing, and yes, at times sad. It is profound, thought provoking, and beautifully written. This story has touched my soul and I will not forget Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters any time soon.That's the thing about pain ... it demands to be felt.I strongly recommend this book to everyone ... male, female, young, and old. It is not like anything I have ever read in the past - it truly is one-in-a-million."
5," Yes, this book is good. Yes, this book is also sad. Yes, John green is amazing and everything he writes is also.But its not a suffocating sadness like other books that leave you with one final biting sentence at the end of the book to exemplify how life isn't fair, boo hoo.This book is about two people who live, even though they are dying.Honestly it made me ashamed I, a perfectly healthy human being, am not living as much as the cancer patients in this book.I just finished this book about 20 minutes ago and feel like I'm having a mid-life (hm well maybe 1/4 life ) crisis.WARNING: THIS BOOK WILL CHANGE THE WAY YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE."
5," This is the greatest piece of literature I have ever stumbled upon. A friend let me borrow her copy, and I immediately went home and read. I didn't expect to get so interested, but nonetheless, I finished the whole thing in 7 and a half hours. I laughed, I cried, and a weird mixture of the two which sounded like a dying walrus. I can't even begin to explain how well written this novel is. As a 15 year old girl with health problems, I, too, know what it's like to go to sleep not having the comfort that you will definitely awaken in the morning or ever fall in love or be remembered when you're gone. This book spoke to me in ways no one ever could. It made me realize that everyone's days are numbered and there is hope and promise in finding pure joy in the little time that we have here on earth. I debated on posting this for a really long time, and then realized why. I was feeling Hazel's same emotion with An Imperial Affliction: wanting to scream to the world that this is greatest book ever written and also wanting to keep it hidden, a secret, kept only for you, and you alone. I then came to the conclusion that if every one in the world read this book and genuinely felt the pain of every character that enters the story, perceive every moment of sheer joy and those of pure desolation John Green inscribed onto  all 313 pages, that the world would reach it's own eternal nirvana. But the world is not a wish-granting factory."
5, only decided to buy the book because I thought the cover was good looking. This isn't a book where teenagers fall in love this is a book where you fall in love with their love. I was so into the book i finished it in a day and a half. I would recommend this to everyone who will listen.
5," Among all the vampires, apocalypses, and plagues John Green's books are always a breath of fresh air. His stories are smart, funny, sad, and utterly true about the world. His characters may not be the average Joe or Jane, but they have something so human at their heart that it impossible to not feel the emotional roller coaster and catharsis of their stories. With Looking for Alaska John took us somewhere heart-heartrendingly sad with teenager suicide. In An Abundance of Katherines we met the charismatic math prodigy searching for love, and finding it in the most unusual of places. In Paper Towns we go on a daring road trip through adventure and love. In Will Grayson, Will Grayson John partnered with David Levithan to bring us the story of two boys trying to find their way in the world and make an identity for themselves. Now in The Fault in Our Stars we meet Hazel Grace and August Waters: teenagers with cancer.From the very opening lines we see immediately that Hazel is darkly sarcastic and deeply afraid. She is sixteen years old and her cancer is slowly killing her. She knows she wants more out of life, but is resigned to the fact that she will not get it. Estranged from her old friends by her disease, she hides in her room re-reading her favorite book over and over again. The book is like Hazel: it is the story of a girl who could have a brilliant future, but her dreams are cut dramatically short (the book literally has no conclusive ending) by cancer. But Hazel's mother is not content to see her daughter waste away what is left of her life inside four walls: so Hazel ends up reluctantly joining a Support Group for teens with cancer. And that is where she meets Augustus Waters.He is beautiful and athletic and funny and smart, and missing a leg from a surgery that saved his life and put him in remission several years before. Hazel is drawn to him because of his energy, his beauty, and the fact that he is instantly interested in her. Within their first day they are fast friends, with the stirrings of something more. Their romance is not love at first sight--at least not for Hazel--and it is not easy. Two teenagers brought low by the betrayal of their bodies can never laugh as easy as those of us who will never understand that pain. But they find the good and the laughter amid all the struggle.As you would expect in a book like this, someone dies. I won't say who, because that ruins the story, but it's no spoiler to say that someone does. The real resonance of this story wouldn't exist without the death of one of the characters. While it might be a great dream/fantasy to read about two kids with cancer who miraculously beat it and go on to live long happy lives, that is not John Green's intention. He doesn't want to tell fantasies. He also isn't telling the hard, plain truth. His stories fall somewhere in the middle--in that place where dreams and reality meet to make us laugh and cry all at once. Even with death and reality looming over their shoulders we cheer for Hazel and Augustus until the very end.So many nay-sayers of young adult fiction would argue that books for teens aren't worth reading because they have no deeper meaning. John Green's books (and so many other fantastic YA authors) blow those people away. The story of Hazel and Augustus is one of facing death, of finding your place in the universe, of wondering what you think about God and the afterlife, of trying to love someone even knowing that one of you will lost the other sooner than later, of trying to find meaning in the chaos.The Fault in Our Stars will be a must-read this year for young adult readers, and readers of any age. It is one of those stories that will touch your heart in unexpected ways, and stick with you long after you have turned the last page."
2," John Green presents to you a novel so incredibly thought out that you'll wonder if you yourself could ever fathom a thought as well as he writes them. Hazel and Augustus are beautifully alive together, even when pushing through death. This book will grip your every essence and torture you with wonderful possibilities, even after it's over. So hopeless, so lovely, so hurtful, and so very daring, A Fault In Our Stars is a magnificent addition to my family of favorite books, to which John Green is no stranger."
5," Yesterday, my mother arrived home with news that she had found a package waiting for me on the doorstep. I knew immediately that it was my copy of TFIOS, as I had been eagerly awaiting its arrival since I had pre-ordered it a year ago. As I began reading it that night, I became so engrossed in the story that I almost had to hurl the book across the room in order to part from it and settle down for a good night's sleep.This afternoon, accompanied by a box of tissues, I finished what I can only describe as the least patronising Young Adult novel I think I've ever encountered. I have been an avid reader since before I started school, and now at the age of nineteen, had long ago moved into adult and classic literature due to the seemingly common belief amongst authors of YA fiction that teenagers are not capable of tackling real issues and 'big' words. Green's writing ( I have also read Paper Towns and An Abundance of Katherines, saving LFA till last) has the same effect on me as the 'modern classics'- it makes me marvel at the power of words, and the ability that some posess to make us think about more than the mundane, every-day workings of our own lives.I promised no spoliers at all, and so I shan't even mention the names of the characters (I'm sure you know them already anyway), but I will say, if you're a teenager who likes it when adults give us the benefit of the doubt, read this novel. If you're an adult- read this novel.I think the best way to finish this review is to point you towards the quote that features on its front cover as the most accurate summation of the 'emotional rollercoaster' (to both use a cliche and throw in a sneeky reference to the novel) that this book will take you on. Or I could simply say, reading this book was a few hours very well spent."
5,"ve read a lot, and I mean a LOT, of YA books. The reason I read so many is because I know that every so often, I'll stumble upon one that turns me inside out. This is one of those books. It's the kind of book that leaves you physically aching after you shut it; the kind that makes you feel like you'll never look at the world the same. This books rips your heart out and makes you feel like there's a bowling ball sitting on your chest. It makes you crack up laughing, until the people sitting near you on the bus look at you like you're crazy. And best of all, it sews you back together again and makes you think -- really think -- about what it means to live in this crazy, devastating, joyful world."
5," Love, Life, and Its Imperial Affliction (NO SPOILERS) Whenever you read a cancer booklet or website or whatever, they always list depression among the side effects of cancer. But, in fact, depression is not a side effect of cancer. Depression is a side effect of dying. (Cancer is also a side effect of dying. Almost everything is, really.) This is how, by page one, John Green had me hooked. Green, author of young adult novels such as Paper Towns, An Abundance of Katherines, and Looking for Alaska, released his newest novel, The Fault in Our Stars, on January 10, 2012. The novel follows sixteen-year old Hazel Grace Lancaster through her battle with, not only cancer, but the challenge of living a meaningful life. Whatever that means. One of the things that connecting me to the text, more so than any of Green's other novels, is the biting and witty realism of Hazel. All of Green's major previous works have been told from the perspective of a teenaged (usually nerdy) male. To read something of his written from the female perspective was a breath of fresh air. Like many of Green's other protagonists, Hazel and her love interest Augustus Waters converse is a fashion that makes me green with envy. Their intellectual quips and humor make me yearn for a generation of teenagers who are more interested in literary debate than the newest edition of Call of Duty. This novel is a roller coaster of emotion. In the five hours I spent devouring it, I giggled, guffawed, screamed in frustration, bawled my eyes out, and laughed through the tears. This myriad of reactions is the sign of a meaningful text. There is no point in experiencing something which gives you nothing in return. Jonathan Franzen once said that The reader is a friend, not an adversary, not a spectator.  Just as friends make each other feel a variety of different emotions, not always positive, if one is being realistic, the reader shares that roller coaster ride with Green with relish and appreciation. Although he writes from the perspective of teenagers and theirs thoughts and feelings, Green's words are universal (speaking to different types of people has become a strong suit of John's, having posted videos for nearly 646,000 Nerdfighter subscribers on the Vlogbrothers YouTube channel he shares with his brother Hank). The special connection I feel to The Fault in Our Stars, however, is not limited to the beauty of Green's language and character development. This literary journey made me consider and appreciate those I love so much more. The day following my completion of The Fault in Our Stars, I felt the incessant need to hug all my friends for extended periods of time, just to try to convey to them, in some small way, how deeply I value them. The Fault in Our Stars will be more than just a beautiful diversion of your time; it will force you to examine your relationships with other people, as well as your relationship to the world itself. It the best possible way. Happy page-turning, and DFTBA.Disclaimer: The Fault in Our Stars contains some depictions of a sexual nature, as well as some mild language, and dark themes concerning death that may not be suitable for some younger bibliophiles."
5," Let me unashamedly state that I am 32 years old and this was one of the best books I've read in years. With precise thought and deep respect, Green plumbs the human spirit, routes the inaneness of our failing theories (such as the stupid theory that we should hold ourselves back from love, or the stupid theories of Maslow in general), and presents insights that have shaped how I the see loves in my life. I know now what a privilege it is to love the people that I know, and I know that from the privilege of reading this book."
5, The book was an excellent book and instantly became my favorite book of all time and most likely for the rest of my life (until John Green makes a better one). I feel nothing can surpass how great this book was. I wish I could tell you about the book but I believe you should get the book and read it for yourself because not one letter of the book should be spoiled.DFTBA to all Nerdfighters
5," feel inadequate to review this book. I read it together with my wife, it was a very good book, and I'm glad I read it. That's all I have to say.Okay, wait, I can add one thing now. As I wrote this review, a singer appeared on the morning show I'm watching, singing to a girl with epilepsy about how strong and amazing she is in her fight with suffering and pain, what a warrior she is. This book offers a much deeper perspective."
5," loved it. It was an easy read, but still wonderfully charming and bittersweet.I promise you'll fall in love with the characters of this beautifully tragic novel."
5," This is the first book I've read by this author, and this isn't the sort of book I would usually choose to read for myself. I just kind of stumbled across it browsing for something to read. I will say I am really glad I read this book.It falls into the category of books I must finish in one sitting. When you read this book, you will understand why.I literally laughed out loud while reading parts of this book. I also cried.Having read this book, I feel like I'm going to LIVE life a little bit differently now, and I can say that not many books have had such an impact on me.Thank you, John Green. Really.Read this book. You will not be disappointed."
5," This is a well written story about young smart witty people struggling with life's biggest adversary. I thought the author wrote the characters precisely as they would likely be if alive and in the cancer situation. He delved into emotions that see on target for grief, suffering, hopelessness and hope and love. He writes young people so well and with such intelligence and humor, that I wish I was more like his young characters when I was their age. Ultimately this story is about love and courage, and the hand life may deal you. I thought it was well portrayed and loved reading this book."
2,"ve never wanted to be friends with the characters from a book more. John Green outdid himself with this beautiful work of art. Each person is vividly described, the dialogue flows smoothly, the plot development doesn't blindside you at any point and is easy to follow. This is my favorite book I've read thus far. The Fault in Our Stars made me laugh and cry. Read this book."
5,"f you're considering reading this book, you can find the first couple of chapters online since John Green read them on his youtube channel, and they will give you an idea of what to expect if you want an idea of the plot.  All of the insights and witticisms and wonderful characters only get better as it goes.  In John's own words, this book will hopefully make you feel 'all of the things!!!' and for me, anyway, it came through in spades (even though it made me cry and I have an extreme aversion to sappy things).In short, if you're considering this at all, I can't think of any good reason not to read it.  I would recommend it to someone 15 years old or 105, someone reading for entertainment or for loftier reasons, someone to whom a plot of ill kids wrestling with the unfair way the healthy world treats them as 'other' is intimately familiar or to anyone who has ever felt 'other' at all.  I'm pretty sure that covers everyone (except for like, babies or something)."
5,"f you are a fan of realistic, honest, smart books, this is the book for you. Although John Green writes in a genre known as young adult, his books are far from kid stuff. He honors young adult literature and teenagers by writing them such intelligent books with characters who are well spoken, funny, and raw. The Fault In Our Stars will make you fall in love with Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters. The sarcastic wit with which they face the world around them brings amazing humor to a grim reality. I am doing everything in my power not to add spoilers to this review and to gush about the latest, and perhaps best yet John Green masterpiece. The Fault In Our Stars is heartbreakingly spectacular. I am an avid reader, and love the Nerdfighter web of authors. This is literally the best book I have read this year. Literally."
5," spent all day reading this, and only took breaks to eat and go to the bathroom. I haven't done that with a book since Harry Potter, and that is really saying something.It's dark and funny and painstakingly honest and bleak... But hopeful too. So hopeful.So often romances in YA novels can seem contrived or based solely on physical attraction regardless of the characters' actual merit... But somehow John Green, I think for the first time in one of his books, really captured a couple who felt a true and deep love. These characters are so special, and they will stay with me for the rest of my life."
5, Simply this: Probably one the most beautiful books I have had the pleasure of reading. DFTBA.
5, The Fault in Our Stars is perfection. You could say it's *puts on sunglasses* faultless. AWWWW YEAHHH. Sorry I couldn't resist that pun. John Green writes engrossing and honest. He makes it feel as though there is no barrier between the story and the reader. And the story is hauntingly beautiful. The characters feel real. The pain and joy feels real. Its honestly the best book I've read ever.  You will lie on your bed after reading this and just think about the amazingness you were lucky enough to experience. You need to read this book. You will not be disappointed. I promise. I'll stop writing this review to go back and reread it.
5," The Fault in Our Stars is quite possibly the most gripping story that I have ever read. It moved me to the point of tears, which no book has done to this effect, ever before. Not Catcher In the Rye, not Great Gatsby, not A Clockwork Orange, not even The Outsiders. I think that this book is not only superior to some of these books, but it deserves a place among them."
5," This book is incredible. It'll have you laughing than crying than laughing again. Buy it right now. You won't regret it, I promise."
5," laughed, I cried, I had a fantastic time reading this book. I definitely would recommend this book to anyone!"
5," can't find the words to describe the greatness of this novel. This book may very well be an instant classic. John Green is my favorite author, and I will continue you to support his writing in every way possible. Read this book. It will change your life."
2," never thought I could have my heart broken by anything other than another living soul, but The Fault in Our Stars proved me wrong completely. This is the first book in a long time that I simply not put down, and for good reason: both the writing and the storyline pulled me in from the first paragraph. The tale of love and loss pales all others that I have read, which is more than a few. John said that he hoped that we, the readers, would feel as if we transcended the limits of ourselves while reading this - I felt that and so much more."
5," Such a great book. I hate when people say a book was so sad while trying to avoid saying that there is death in the story, as if they haven't already spoiled something by saying it was so sad. Obviously there is death. You can't have a book with cancer and NOT have death. But this book is still different than the myriad of cancer kid books out there.Different, good.Different, painful.Different, meaningful.Different, special.It's filled with equal parts love and fear, hope and despair, humor and sadness. It's indescribable. Just do yourself a favor and read it."
5, This book was amazing!!!!  I could not put it down.  It makes you cry and laugh and really think all at the same time.  By far one of the best books I've ever read.  And I got a signed copy!
5,"ve been a John Green fan for a long time, but none of his books have ever got me so hooked. I literally could not put this book down, and I finished it the day I got it. This book will make you laugh and cry at the same time. (Literally)"
5," loved this book so much, but I was devastated when Augustus Waters died. I know there won't be another GOOD book without Augustus Waters, but atleast a summary of what happens to the other characters. Just like how Hazel wanted a summary of Imperial Affliction. You did an amazing job, John green, but you need another book...."
5, have never taken the time out of my day to write a review about anything unless it was convenient or required but this book was so moving that I had too. I love John as as author as well as a person and he (through youtube) has given me much knowledge and wisdom. I cannot thank him enough for his contributions to society and me as an individual.
5," would recommend this book to everyone who loves to read, likes to read, or has ever picked up a book before. John is a Complete genious when it comes to writing entertaining and heartfelt novels. It one of those books that will make you laugh and cry within the same chapter. Highly recommend you read this book and I guarantee you won't regret it"
5," This book is amazing. It portrays such a realistic ambience, one that not many authors can pull off. You will really feel that you're hovering over the rooms the characters are in, READ and as if the story really is true. READ IT. that's all there is to it. It will give you new outlooks on life, and you get to enjoy an incredible story. Go for it."
5," John Green does it again in what can be described as a beautiful story of a young girl and boy who both are lucky enough to experience love. Cancer is at the forefront of this story, but there's more to it. Green has a way of instantly capturing your attention and caring so deeply for all characters involved.Highly recommend this book."
5," Readers beware. If you dislike great books that occasionally bring you to tears and fill you with emotion, don't buy this book.  If you despise books that have beautifully quirky characters and tell stories of youthful romances then you should quickly leave this page.  If however, you enjoy these feelings and types of books then please read this."
2,"m half-kidding, obviously. I read this on one day and couldn't stop. It was so good! At the end, I sort of just entered a complicated emotional state I'm still not over from. I cried. A lot. But also laughed a lot. This book made me so happy inside and then tore me apart. Highly recommended! I hope they don't mess it up when it becomes a movie!"
5," hadn't really had time for any reading I wanted to do, and I ended up getting this on my kindle for a long weekend and read it in two days. It was extremely engaging, fast paced with characters that you really connect with and feel for.  Get the tissues ready though.  I definitely shed a few tears which doesn't happen often when reading for me."
5, Read the book in a day &amp; a half. Thanx to spoilers I already knew what would happen but it didn't matter either way. I know supposedly this book is a serious tear jerked but reading it made me happy. Yes they're all ill but how many of us have the chance to meet our own Augustus or Hazel? The book shows the world as it is &amp; I loved it's honesty.
5, had heard so much about this book in the last few months and had yet to read it because of the amount of holds at the library.  I went ahead and bought it for my kindle and immediately was captivated by it!  I finished the book in three days.  The Fault in Our Stars is one of the best composed and utterly realistic romances novels I have read.
4, loved how real this was written like you could feel their personalities in the way they spoke.I'm happy I got to read this before the movie came out as time goes on I'm sure I will get better at writing reviews however it is a good sign that each book I have written so far has been great and left me feeling likeno I don't want it to be over!
5, TerrificHeartbreakingEye openingFunnyAchingly sadUnusual twistLoveable charactersTrue lifeInfinityNot your everyday love storyOutstandingUniqueRealisticSnappy dialogueTear jerkerAlways on my mindReaders group mustSuperb
4," So relevant to our time. Amazing book. I loved every bit if it. I am forever grateful to my school for recommending this book. So good. From the beginning of the novel, I was constantly crying from sadness, or crying from laughter. The only downside to this book is that your belly will hurt from laughing so hard. Good abdominal workout though..."
5," Very few young adult fiction leaves me as a reader with something to think about. I read the Last few pages in the early hours of the morning before school. And it left me with an awful sensation in my stomach, like a stone just sitting there. I couldn't stop thinking about it. Which is a big reason w huh u this novel as cores so big in my book."
5," A plot summary can't do this book justice.  The characters are wonderful, the dialog and first-person writing is funny and smart (if maybe a little too well-read and insightful to be completely believable coming from teenagers, but I'm willing to suspend belief because it's that entertaining), and the story is beautiful.  Definitely a must read."
5, This story brings forth every emotion.  It forces the reader to experience the book physically.  It is very well written and has a beautiful way of guiding the reader to experience the world through the character's  thoughts and views. It is often witty and smart. I highly recommend it.  I couldn't put it down.  One of my new all-time favorites.
2," This is by far the best thing I've ever read. This book has inspired me to be more grateful for my health, my family, etc. Words cannot describe the amount of emotions I received. I cried with feelings of complete and utter saddness, unfathomable anger , and genuine laughter. John Green is an amazing writer and a true understander of human life."
5," Got this book on time!Great purchase.A must read.Love the story line and hate it at the same time just because it didn't ended the way I wanted it to.But, hey, that's what makes it a great book.I love writers who aren't afraid to kill or change their characters!It makes me sad but it makes the book better, well if it is written well."
5," This well-crafted book took my heart on a roller coaster ride while it took my head on a train ride. Highly recommended reading for anyone who is going through cancer or who loves anyone who is on that journey or for anyone who is learning to live with love and loss. Essentially, this book is for those who embrace the experience of being human."
5," This book just blew me away. I truly fell in love with both Hazel and Augustus. I found myself laughing out loud a ton... considering this book is about young people with cancer. But I also found myself mourning and reflecting on those teenage years and young love.Loved this book, loved the dialogue, can't speak it's praises enough."
5," was very courious about this book, and I thought this book was about something else. BUT It wasn't disappointing!! I really loved it, It was a great love story and self discovery of ones self and living the best life you can with the cards you are delt.Families with children that have cancer. It is a hard life. Very touching and lovely story."
5, love this book it shows that books don't always have to have happy ending and u don't always have to be perfect and u can still have a great life. The author (John Green) is an amazing author who puts so much effort into his writing he's creative and just a spectacular author. I just wish there weren't as many deaths in the world as there r.
5," This really is a sad book. It's an amazing book... but it's a sad one. At the beginning I decided to just jump to the end and see what happened. I was shocked but wasn't truly upset. But when i actually got to the part (reading everything before it) I sobbed like a little baby. It was truly heart wrenching. And for that Mr John Green, 5 stars."
5," Although this is a young adult novel, I loved every sentence of it. The characters were so very human and you fell in love with them quickly, absorbed by their situations and the ways they chose to manage their cancer-driven lives. So many light-hearted moments, too. I think/hope this will become a classic for teens and possibly their parents."
5," had no expectations about the book. It was on one of the Amazon Kindle lists. Once I started reading. I could not put it down. In short, it is about the lives of teenagers who are living with various stages of cancer. They want to live and die on their terms.  They do so with courage, humor, and all the snarkiness of teenagers. A good read."
5," This book changed me. It makes me think and feel and ache more than I ever have in my whole life. I understand death and life and people better after reading it, and me being the naive 16 year old that I am, that's a big deal. John Green has done it again with this masterpiece. This story is an instant classic wrought with pain and true love."
2," This book had been recomended to me by multiple people, so I eventually broke down and got it from the library. Let me just say, this book is amazing. There is a perfectly crafted plot line paired with lovable characters. With that said, I feel that the character development was a bit rushed. I highly recommend reading (and buying) this book."
5, This book provides an insightful and provocative look at the lived experience of an adolescent with cancer. It is both humorous and poignant. I am a healthcare provider and am recommending it to all my oncology and pediatric colleagues. It is an excellent read for anyone who wants to understand more about the experience of living with cancer.
5, John Green does a very good job writing from a teenage girl's point of view. I thought the portrayal of cancer treatment was also very accurate. The dialog and thoughts are very blunt and realistic. I loved the humor and Hazel is a wonderful and inspiring character. I'm only half-way through the book and am having a hard time putting it down!
5," This novel about two young adults with cancer makes you fall in love with the protagonists but not in a manipulative way. The plot is fun, down to earth, romantic, and thrilling despite the omnipresence of cancer. I had to race to the end to see how it would unfold, and it is sweet and just. I loved reading this book, one of the best of 2012."
5," This young adult novel takes readers through the ageless story of love and loss/ confrontation with mortality in an entertaining &amp; thoughtful way. I'm not sure if it was the way I was captured by the book or the simplicity of the text that allowed me to tear through the pages in less than 24 hours, but the quality was such that I don't mind."
5," Moved me. For many reasons. The reality that true love is something that's rare these days and the miniscule probability that I will find for myself or for somebody I personally know are amongst them.Easy read. I did not stop reading even if I needed to, because it was a page turner and my need to finish it compelled me strongly."
5," The picture of the book was signed, and John Green said Amazon should have had enough signed copies to distribute. I would greatly like a bookplate that he will be sending to Amazon and Amazon UK for those who did not receive signed editions of the book.Other than that, the book is utterly life changing. No matter how old you are. Read it."
5," think I read this is super high expectations, from everyone talking about it, and seeing the previews for the movie. It was a nice story, kinda sad, but was a nice read. I was getting down to the last few pages and wondering how it's suppose to end in the next few paragraphs. There wasn't much of a close to the story, just kinda ended...."
5," went into this book just looking for something to read on a long flight. What I found was a remarkable story with so much more than I originally thought it had to offer. I assumed it was sad, little love story and that would entertaining but not deep. I was completely wrong in this assumption. Read the book, don't give it another thought."
5," just loved this story.  The characters are well written and brutally honest.  I laughed and cried.  I felt like I just couldn't get enough, I wanted to know more about all the characters lives after the book ended.  However all good things come to an end.  Don't shy away because labeled young adult, this story is for all mature audiences."
2, The Fault In Our Stars is worth reading. It is heartfelt and has an amazing story. Hazel is such a strong character threw her cancer yet she never gives up on her family. Things may seem tough for her at times but it's still a real page Turner. I highly recommend reading this book and seeing the movie when it comes out in May or June
5," A simple but beautifully written book with characters that are as believable as they are lovable. The dialogue is sharp, witty and truthful. The spine of the book, though difficult and one that could easily drift into a smarmy delivery, is handled with  wisdom, courage, and great humanity. This is a great book, not just a great youth book."
5," Although John Green generally writes for young adults, and I am an older adult, I truly enjoyed this book. Wonderfully written. Themes: strength and weakness in the face of adversity, platonic and romantic love, priorities, hope, disillusionment, “The world is not a wish-granting factory.” Highly recommend this book for anyone, at any age."
5," This is the first book I have ever read on a Kindle and I thoroughly enjoyed it!  I was hesitant to do any reading of books thinking it wouldn't hold my attention or that I would lose my place.  The movie has just come out here in El Paso, and I am very excited to go watch the movie and see the characters come to live in the big screen!!!"
5," Unless you like sappy, corny  love stories then you should avoid this book.  Being a cancer patient myself, I can say with all honesty that the story wasn't realistic or believable.  They are promoting it as the love story of the year and it falls way short of that billing.  I would not recommend this story for young teenagers at all."
5," was so scared to read this book, afraid that it would rip my heart out. Which it did kinda, but that's to be expected situation like this. The characters just in this book are so easy to fall in love with. I love their humor and how they talk to each other. I love how it's a cancer story but also a love story. I just loved it period. &lt;3"
2, This book not only touched my heart and expand my knowledge of books but also taught me the truth yes I know was my suppose to find a true meaning behind this story but the truth with this story is that even though theses two fictional characters have nightmare that may never go away they found it in each other to live life to the fullest
5," This book made me realize how heartbreaking and terrible cancer can be. It also let me see what it would be like to be in that kind of situation. I really wish  you could change the plot of the story and create a happy ending but in reality there isn't happy endings, and that's something I also like about this book is that it's real/true."
5," No book I have ever read has caused me to feel as deeply as this one did. The only others that managed to come even close were Mr. Green's other works. The emotions are visceral, they're real, they're heartbreaking and they are so. Very. Beautiful. I cannot praise it highly enough, there aren't strong enough words in the English language."
5, The Fault In Our Stars was a riveting love story about two teenagers struggling with terminal cancer. I read the book twice savoring over every last word. This book inspired me to the point where I have no words. I pride John Green in creating this glorious work of art and I advise those who have not read it to begin as soon as possible.
2," This was a very good read.  It's the first book I have read written by John Green.  However, I am now looking forward to reading his other works very soon.  The story line being about cancer hit close to home for me.  I would recommend this book to anyone really.  It's an easy read - I finished it in 2 days which is very uncommon for me."
5," Not what I expected when I started it. I had a few questionable choices in my to read list in the last few weeks and this book was absolut jackpot!!!!!!!!!!Witty, smart, devastating, and so well written.It is a journey, a  very moving one.Impossible to put down.I am now and officially an absolut fan of this guy."
4," This book for me is what An Imperial Affliction was for Hazel. I can absolutely read this novel over and over again, yet never quite be able to explain to someone why I enjoy it so much. Never before has a novel brought me to tears, yet made me smile at the same time. John Green is a phenomenal writer, and this novel will not disappoint."
5," This novel is geared toward Young Adults but I recommend as a must read for all ages, young adult and adult alike!  This is a quick read with a heartwarming story of young love.  It's sad, funny and touching all at the same time.  Fault in Our Stars is one of those books you will be thinking about and discussing long after you finish it."
5," couldn't wait to read another John Green book and was glad I got this one by preordering it! High school kids love John Green and old people, like me, do, too.This one is a poignant account of teens with cancer....close to home to so many. I found myself crying, and I laughed aloud at so many parts that describe teens in high school."
5," This is by far one of the best books I have ever read. At first I didn't exactly want to read a cancer book, but I can assure this is nothing like any other one I have read. Thank you, John Green for letting the awesomeness that is The Fault in Our Stars be a part of this world. By writing this the world suck has gone down tremendously."
5," A book is written that finds a part of you that you went aware existed. It's hard to believe that someone you've never met can have the ability to extrapolate these feelings out of you with the simple written word. However John Green seems to have such an ability in A Fault in Our Stars, as I have never felt so happy to be quite so sad."
5," Look, I can say no more great things that anyone else who has posted before me.This book is beautiful and haunting.Funny and Smart.Real and Cliche.And it's filled with symbolism, some of which is obvious, some of which is painfully subtle, and some of which one of the main characters will gladly point out for you.Just read it."
5, This book was so well written I got involved with the characters.  I liked it because it wasn't sappy. Hazel and Augustus faced death right in the face. They were so courageous.  They accepted their fate and went on. I so loved it that Hazel and Augustus had this love story going on until the end.  It was a wonderful book! I loved it!!
5," The realness of the book is heartwrenching.  You truly care about the characters and are heartbroken when tragedy hits them.It is a sad book, as the young characters have illnesses and, as I said, tragedy finds them.I would say this is like reading John Green's other book, Looking For Alaska."
2," This book came highly recommended to me from several people, so maybe it was just over-hyped. In places, it struck me as Nicholas Sparks with more highbrow references. The story is engaging, but it feels like typical YA fiction. To me, it wasn't a very successful crossover for adult audiences, but maybe that just isn't what John Green was trying to write."
5," This is a masterpiece that most people don't find because they don't look hard enough. They have their eyes closed, not able to see, just like Isaac. But i- a 12 YEAR OLD GIRL -found this book! I am so glad that someone was so brilliant that they were able to make this AMAZING book! Thank you, John Green for making this wonderful book"
2," would have to say this is one of the best books I have read. There is something so real and raw about it. It is a book about love, and cancer, and finding yourself, and being true to yourself. It is told in such a real way that I laughed, and cried, and just felt like I really KNEW the characters. Definitely a must read for any age."
5," My little sister loved it. She's almost 11 and I got if for her because she was so excited and her friends were all seeing the movie. There were some inappropriate parts for a girl her age, but they served as opportunities for mature conversations. She really enjoyed the book. The shipping was fast and the book was in good condition."
5," Wow! This book was really, really wonderful. I read it in like, two vacation days. Such a real look at life and death and hope and cancer. Loved the heady verbal plays, even if they seemed a little too mature for the characters. Still utterly delightful and one of the best parts of the book. Don't miss this book, not a waste of time."
4, have read other books by John Green and this one is amazing as the rest. Maybe even more. It will make you cry that is not a lie but with that it will also make you laugh. I think everyone can take something from this story. And every one should read it. I never read books more than once but I would read this over and over again xx
5," He has done it again. John NEVER forgets to be awesome, and this book is yet another proof of this. After reading it a few too many times (if one can read a book too many times) i can easily say that it is one of my top three favourite John Greens- together with Looking for Alaska and Paper Towns. As my wrist tattoo says: d.f.t.b.a.!"
5," A must-read. This book tugged at my heartstrings and really, really made me think. The characters are dimensional and realistic, and I got completely caught up in the plot. No other young adult author can hold a candle to John Green.If you're thinking about buying this book, stop thinking and buy it already. You'll be glad you did."
5," bought this book after I saw the movie trailer. I was totally moved by that movie trailer and found this book has incredibly high scores. I never thought I could finish a 300 page novel within three days, considering English is not my first language. But I did. And I totally enjoyed read, crying several times like a little girl..."
5, My 14 year old granddaughter told me I should read this book.  I downloaded it reluctantly thinking it was a book for teens.  It certainly is that and more!  What a beautiful story about friendship and love even thought the main characters have been diagnosed with cancer.  I look forward to the next book my granddaughter recommends.
2, know a book is good when I can't feel the time passing by and my reality turns into that which is in the book. John Green is a wonderful author. He wrote about things that were so real and meaningful. I laughed and cried and I fell in love with The Fault in our Stars. I can easily say it's on my favorites list. Highly recommended.
5," This book is not what I expected, but I'm so glad I read it. It's the most sad and tragic book I've ever encountered, but also by far the happiest and most hopeful. Careful to who reads it, you WILL cry. I sobbed. And there's a plot twist, which I LOVE. I never write reviews, but this book deserved one. Read it, you won't regret it."
5," This book...I was skeptical about reading because Augustus Waters died of the same cancer that my grandmother died of! I was so glad that I read it because it inspires Me to look past illness to find love an  compassion in someone, and that we all wish, but alas the world is not a wish granting factory! I cruelly recommend the book!"
5," This is one of  my top 5 books of all time (and I read a lot of books).  This book made me think, made me feel and changed the way I see the world!  I will teach this book soon, but this book is definitely not just for teens. I have recommended it to 5 people (I read it twice since January 5th) and they all loved it.READ THIS!"
5," For me the book was a powerful, moving wake up call. There is something so real, so raw and powerful, so moving in this book.In the end what matters, is the experience of reading a book, and reading this one was special and moving in many significant ways. If you want a wake up call, if you want a look at reality - read this book."
5," The Fault in Our Stars is an incredibly written book that everyone should read. It's about cancer patient Hazel Grace Lancaster, who meets Augustus Waters at a cancer support group. Together, they discover a lot about themselves and each other and what life really means until something devastates the couple. Excellent read. DFTBA :)"
5,"ll be honest, I am a 21 year old who frequently takes life for granted. This story was such a beautiful wakeup call and such a well written book about young love and the pain life and death hold... I cannot recommend this book enough. I sat down for 4 hours and read it one sitting and I encourage people of any age to do the same!"
5," My daughter loves this author so I had to read this one. I thought it was going to be a kids book but not so.Pro's--Great read, not too long, extremely insightful. Rated as Awesome by my daughter. You can read a book togehter with your kid!Cons'--It's about teens with cancer so don't expect a fairytale ending."
5," typically don't write reviews, however this book left a significant mark on me. I have never read something that has caused me to contemplate life in the way I am after finishing the book. John Green is an incredible author who created characters who made their way into my heart. I highly recommend this book to those of all ages."
5," Wow! This book is amazing, breathtaking and just beautifully written! This is John Green's best book yet! I think this is the best book ever and it is certainly the best book I've ever read and I've read over 200 books! This is a great book and a 100% recommend this to any customer. I assure you; John Green is the BEST AUTHOR EVER!"
2, love how this book is set out. It makes you want to keep turing the pages! I got so caught up in this book! I finished it reasonably fast because I didnt ant to put it down! It ios so sad though! I love how there are always two or more perspectives in this book! I recommend this book very highly! THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ!!
5," Without coming across as cloying. I thoroughly enjoyed this story of teenage love and hope recommended to me by my granddaughter.The book was well-written and his portrayal of Hazel and Augustus believable, not an easy feat when dealing with teens.I wholeheartedly recommend this book to readers of all ages."
5," This is an emotional, witty, smart read. I have recommended this to people of all ages. Having had a family member pass from cancer, this gave me a new perspective.You will cry at the end...and maybe multiple times throughout. Very, very well written. I found myself wishing I knew Augustus! I am looking forward to the movie!"
5," Where to begin with this book? John green is an amazing writer. I fell in love with Hazel (main character) and her dry humor and wit. The plot moves along perfectly without giving too much away. The characters are real and unapologetic.  I hope to see this turned into a feature film, and I hope Green is involved to see it through."
5," Even though I choked away the tears through the first sentence of chapter 21, it was worth it. This is the best book I read in 2012 and I'm hoping that l will soon get to be a reader of another fantastic book such as this one. My vocabulary has recently expanded as well being only a seventh grader. I would read this again any day."
5," only read this book, because I want to see the movie. While reading it, I laughed. I cried. I know their pain. My brother had cancer. My husband had cancer. My grandmother had cancer. Cancer killed my grandfather. I felt like I was watching the movie, as I read. I could see it all happening. I loved it. I truly, truly loved it."
5," don't even know what to say. I really am so upset this book is actually over. I got so drawn into this book and it made me look at things in a completely different way. Thank you John Green for writing this amazing, inspiring book. Unbelievable how emotional I got throughout this book. It would be a shame not to read this book!"
5," This was a random buy and I absolutely loved it! I found the story compelling on multiple levels and having had someone close to me pass away from cancer, I could relate even though the main characters were not my age group at all. Simple, profound, touching, inspiring - it probably is not for everyone but I enjoyed every minute."
5," This book was interesting.  It was well written with a rather unique subject:  centering around a terminally ill teenage girl and her friends and family.  That said, it is not depressing or morbid.  For the most part it is rather humorous and light-hearted.  The author clearly has talent to deal with this topic in such a fashion."
5," This is absolutely one of my favorite books of all time. It is also the first of John Green's books that I've ever read, and since then I've read all of his books. I loved this book, and I gave it a five star rating because John Green deserves it for writing such a fantastic novel that many people have enjoyed.-Carrie"
2," Don't let the fact that the main characters are teenagers turn you away from this book; it is not a novel just for kids. This is one of the best books that I have read in a long while. It is a bittersweet story about life and love. Read it and be prepared to laugh, cry, and love these characters....it will leave you wanting more."
5," started this book during a flight. Never, but never thought that a misanthrope like me can be so deeply moved by an american novel. I did, I almost wept and I don`t care if these are (or not) behaviors a teenager could display in a situation like that described in the book. The book is nice written and very very touchy. Period."
5," cried harder throughout this book than I ever thought was possible. This is an absolute work of art. The Fault in Our Stars is by far the best book I have ever read, and I feel blessed to have had the opportunity. This book touched me in a way no other book has and I am utterly amazed by its excellence. Bravo John Green. Bravo."
5," The hype is unwarranted.  This was a good &amp; very quick read, and though it's plot &amp; wording are geared toward the reader who is the same age as the main characters (16/17), it should be viewed closely by the parent first.The language was not excessive, but the tone of the characters towards adults &amp; authority was unnecessary.  Good literature in the past for this age group did not have the need for this tone.  We don't need it today, either.There is sexual content, and some readers (especially junior high) are too emotionally immature (regardless of what they already know) to be reading this....sexual positions, very casual losing of virginity, etc.  Spoiler: the 2 main characters have safe sex.  Though I'm glad that the safe part, i.e. - condom, was specifically mentioned, I don't appreciate how easily these 2 characters found safety in each other on their first sexual experience.  There was no nervousness or really even much mentioning afterward.  I don't advocate this age of kids having sex, but I'm not naive that it happens, and as a parent, I felt betrayed by the authority by how casually these 2 entered into losing their virginity.It's a decent book, but I really can't figure out why it is so popular.  There are plenty of great books out there!"
5," Holt McDougal has to be my favorite author.  If you like this novel, I recommend reading his others like Looking for Alaska and Paper Towns.  Happy reading!"
3," ** SPOILER ** After hearing all the hype about The Fault In Our Stars by John Green, I was very excited when I got the chance to read it. Because of all the positive attention this book had been receiving, I set really high standard. However, after reading the book I was left with a lot of mixed feelings. I thought it was a good book for the most part, but I had two major problems that seriously impacted my opinion on the book. Despite my two major problems with the book, I found myself not being able to put the book down because I was interested in what was going to happen next. I would recommend this book to mostly teenage girls, but I would warn them that it does not live up to what it is cracked up to be.This book was my first John Green book, and I was very impressed. I really liked his style of writing and thought that it was able to drastically boost the success of the book. The way he wrote the book made me want to keep reading, to see what was going to happen next. Green also did a very good job on creating an emotional bond between the book and the readers of the book. I felt like I was in the relationship, feeling the emotions and the heartwarming and heart-wrenching events. I also really enjoyed the actual story line. The love story was so touching because of the two people involved. Augustus and Hazel have gone through a lot and having them so happy was very sentimental. They deserved each other and it was very nice being able to experience the relationship evolve. On the other hand, I did not like how unrealistic the book was. Augustus and Hazel are teenagers, who haven't known each other for that long. They went to Amsterdam together and Hazel's mom let the two of them walk around a foreign country by themselves. I found that to be very impractical. Also, Hazel and Augustus do not talk nor act like teenagers. I understand they have gone through a lot that the average teenager does not experience, but there actions would not be that different. They both seem way to mature for their age, which made it hard for me (a teenager) to connect with them. I also found this book way to predictable. Two teenagers both experienced cancer, then they magically fall in love, and then one of them dies. The second that Hazel and Augustus met I knew that was going to happen. It was so simple. Because I knew what was going to happen for the majority of the book, it seemed frivolous that I was even reading it. I think I would have been able to enjoy the book a lot more if the ending was more surprising.In general, I would say that the book was mediocre. I do not understand why it is rated so highly and has won many awards. I did enjoy reading the book, but the ending was way to obvious. Maybe with a different ending, I would have understood all the success with this book. But for me, the book was overrated."
5," This book, simply stated, was hauntingly beautiful.  It examines our human tendency to place ourselves at the center of all things with acute accuracy.  It also delves deeply into the reality of borrowed time and morality.  For anyone who has ever lost someone to cancer (I have, I lost my mother) this book speaks its own kind of truth to that pain but further lets the reader explore the opposite side, the affected person's reality.  You don't just get to be the one losing, you get to be the one lost.  It is painful and left me listless and teary-eyed but I fear a better person.  A stronger one.That is my main reason for recommending this book.  Like Green's other works it not only speaks to that part of your soul you let go dormant as you trudge through your daily life, it sings to it, making you stand under an open sky and contemplate not only the fault in our stars but the fault in ourselves.Read it and be better for it."
3," This book sucks you in. Truly sucks you in. I started reading and didn't stop until I was done, no matter how much my eyes complained and demanded sleep.The main criticism of John Green's novels is that his characters seem too smart to be teenagers. They speak eloquently, use big words, and seem philosophical beyond their years. Those people obviously do not know John Green's audience. A great deal of them are active readers and when you are an active reader (of good literature), you tend to have a bigger vocabulary and are often accused of being pretentious. Shouldn't we be encouraging our kids to be verbose and deep? I attended the New Orleans stop of John's tour and he made a fantastic observation that sums up my feelings quite well. When he was asked to name his favorite books, and among them listed The Great Gatsby, the audience (made up mostly of people in their teens and early 20s) erupted into applause and cheers. John mused that the parents in the audience should be proud of having kids that cheer literature, and he is completely correct. This is the audience John writes for--teenagers that wear Great Gatsby shirts, sing songs about science, and that have most of the furniture in their rooms covered with books. The reason they know these big words is because they are written in a book that captures how they feel about love, and life, and video games. And Swedish hip hop.Cancer isn't eloquent, but that doesn't mean those living with it can't be. They can be angry, and passionate, and scared, all feelings that John's characters experience. As you read, you'll fall in love with this book like one falls asleep--slowly, and then all at once. And then you'll stay asleep. Like...a coma. But a pleasant one. Because the sleep is a metaphor for love, and you'll stay in love with the book...get it?Just buy the book."
5," Do you see what I did there? :DAnyway, this isn't going to be a terribly long review because I don't want to get spoilery.  My thoughts?  The book is a TREMENDOUS work, and I very well may have said that about all of the books that I've read by John, but this just takes the cake.  I laughed, I cried, I wanted to travel internationally, but most of all, I wanted to know these characters in real life.  That's the thing about John Green's characters:  They're just so relatable, and I think Hazel and Augustus are even more so than some of his other.(I won't lie, though.  I want a friend like Tiny. <a class=a-link-normal href=/Will-Grayson-Will-Grayson/dp/0142418471>Will Grayson, Will Grayson</a>)I bought the nook book on release day (Don't hurt me, Amazon) and I had the novel read in a day's time, but that's not gonna stop me from reading my newly delivered, J-Scribbled, hard cover copy, and you should, too.DFTBA."
5," so wish that I could adequately describe just what The Fault in Our Stars did to me. John was certainly right to say the book would make me feel All of the feelings!!!! because I most certainly did during the 4 hours I sat down in my room to read this novel beginning to end. One minute, I would be sad about Hazel's condition and the next I would forget entirely that she was a girl living with cancer. Other moments I would be engulfed by sadness and crying uncontrollably and suddenly Hazel or Augustus would marvel me with their amazing wit and humor and I would be laughing while crying.Do not deny yourself the pleasure of reading this book just because the protagonist is a teenager with cancer. I can assure this book is much more about LIVING than it is about dying.Did I feel sad while reading certain parts? Absolutely. It was impossible not to given the situation and my complete love of the characters. Did my viewpoint on life change after reading this book? It most certainly did. I would go so far as to say that if you read this book and it does not make you evaluate your life, the way you live it, and the people in it than you must have gotten some erroneous copy of the novel.It has been years since I have read a book that has made such an impact on me as an individual and the way I see my place in the world. I'm not saying that I haven't read good books in the past few years (I mean, I read the Hunger Games trilogy 2 years ago and I love it nearly as much as Harry Potter) but none of the books I've read recently have made me feel quite like this one.Please do yourself the favor of reading this novel. I have already recommended it to everyone I know so now I recommend it to you, dear stranger of the interweb reading this post. I do hope you listen and are able to gain as much from this novel as I was."
2, The reason my head hurts is because I got this booked sent to me (signed copy!) and proceeded to sit down today and just read. I didn't stop I just read because I could not put the book down. Another amazing book by John Green as someone who is only 20 I was just a teenager and can relate to many of his books. This is a must read for any nerd fighter and anyone who loves his previous work. If you have never read John Green this is a great book to be introduced to with. When I read it I just kept thinking about Esther the entire time R.I.A
5,"t was a good book, I couldn't put it down, but with all the media hype I expected more. I couldn't have done with out the cursing (especially the overuse 'G' damn). My 10 year old daughter wants to read it next, but even with this labeled as 'young adult' I'm not sure it's appropriate for all ages due to language. I miss Gus!!!"
5," This is seriously the best book I've ever read. John Green has always been my favorite author ever since I heard of him. I dont care how old you are, what gender you are, whatever. I think you should read this book. Especially before the movie comes out in June. I have never seen a bad review or comment about this book. Read it."
4," The Fault In Our Stars, by John Green is a beautifully written story. It grabs my attention in ways I couldn't have imagined. To call this book sad is an understatement. We should give  credit where credit is due. The Fault In Our Stars is truly a plethora of life lessons that will change your life. I know because it did for me."
5," This book is amazing! it's sad and thought provoking, but also has humor.  Once i picked this book up I couldn't put it down.  By the end of the book I was sobbing.  You will fall in love with the characters. This book is so well written.  Everybody should read this no matter what age you are.  I promise you that you'll love it!"
5, never really read a book that almost brought me to tears other than this book. I really enjoyed it. I loved the characters and seeing their struggle and the romance that blossoms between them. The last days of Augustus makes your heart sink. The pre funeral and the last letter of Augustus was the best and most beautiful parts.
5,"m feeling a great deal of depression right now, which is a side effect of dying. I might as well be dead considering this book just crushed my heart, and took my breath away- no pun intended. Sadly, depression is also cause by finishing a book and not knowing what else to do with your life. But alas I must move on. Okay? Okay."
5," From the first chapter, I fell in love with the characters that John Green created. I aspire to write as deeply and intelligently as this book is written. It's a very quick read, but I did my best to stretch it out over a week so it wouldn't be over too fast. I only hope the movie lives up to it. I don't know if that's possible."
5," can't even begin to describe the beauty of this book. Half the time I was balling like a baby. It was wonderfully written, the characters well crafted. I highlighted nearly everything and book-marked so much I doubt it can be called a bookmark. If you know what's good for you and really want to feel something, read this book."
5," The kind of story you'd expect to be featured alongside other popular love stories such as the Notebook. It is beautiful in all aspects. It is easy (and hard, once you've stopped crying) on the eyes. To put it shortly, the word okay will never be just okay, to me any more, and for that I am EXTREMELY grateful to John Green."
2," The Fault in Our Stars may be classified YA; but despite the young voice of its narrator, Hazel sends messages beyond what is expected of 16-17-year-olds. The novel is unexpected, poignant, and thought-provoking. It should make all of us think a little longer on the little blessings of life- like a well-written book."
5," This book is truly amazing. It if filled with emotion and happiness, and that's why I think it is so spectacular! Using cancer as the base was a good idea to show what it can do and in your words it shows how to live with it. I cried so much because of Augustus. He was an amazing character filled with life, and hope for Hazel."
5," chose this five star rating for the fact that it made me feel. It made me feel good, happy, sad, angry, in love, and just a bit hungry! The believability of the characters is flawless. A love so young innocent and true. A live that aches to your core. That is the kind of love that everyone should desire. Even in Cancervania."
5, Never once have I read a book that made me cry and laugh as much as this one. This book made me think and feel things I have never experienced before. Thank you John Green for being such a brilliant writer and for giving me the pleasure of reading it. You're a genius. Please keep writing more books.... unlike Peter Van Houten.
5," sat down to read this last night, not really knowing what to expect from it. When I finished it early this morning it's safe to say I was significantly touched by this piece of writing. Incredibly touching, poignant, tragic, hilarious, beautiful, and incomparably authentic, do yourself a favor and buy this book. That is all."
5," This is a beautiful book !!! I cried nearing to the end... I really admired the characters... We don't get to choose whether or not we get hurt in this life, but we do get to choose who hurts us... The only fault i find with this book is the amount of expletives... That was a bit unnecessary.. But otherwise... Very touching.."
5," Even though I figured out what the inevitable end to this book was going to be about a third into it, I still enjoyed it immensely.  The humor is slightly sarcastic, but definitely comes from a place of love, and I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a quick read that will inspire you to be grateful for your life."
5," There are few books in this world that can grip you and change your life, even if just for a moment.  This is one of those books.  I became engrossed in this story, and fell in love with the characters.  This is a book worth reading, especially if you have ever experienced loving someone with cancer.  Moving and lovely story."
4," This was an enchanting coming-of-age novel. It was so real for me. My niece has been battling leukemia for 2 years and the sometimes uncomfortable reality of this story and its characters was compelling. I laughed, cried and pondered the fragility of this life we lead. I think almost anyone would find this an insightful read."
5, This book epitomizes what young love should include. It wasn't overly sexual or crude and it leaves you with a bittersweet appreciation of not only the book but life itself. In the end any emptiness or dissatisfaction you acquired is replaced with completeness and confidence in the functioning of our characters and ourselves.
2," can't remember the last time I read a book in less than 2 hours. I can't also remember having cried as much to any books (the most consistent tears have been shed, so far, in college, reading La Dame aux Camelias, but it doesn't compare to the amount of tears this tiny book has produced. The movie is next on my to do list."
5,"m eleven years old and I love this book! But here's some helpful advice, when seeing what this book is about look on Amazon or Barnes and noble. They tell the biggest spoilers! I recommend this book to advanced readers who don't mind some adult words. I think that if you buy this book the money is well spent HAPPY READING!"
5, this is a wonderful book that you most definitely must read. John Green's way of portraying characters is incedibly easy to understand. this is an a.azing book in which two star crossed lovers learn about what life is and i not. this book is definitely a must read. sorry for any mistakes as i am typing on a kindle keyboard.
5," The Fault in Our Stars allows us to understand that our love is infinite and that we do not need to to remembered as greatly as it is perceived. As we leave this world we'll leave scars and the further we reach for immortality the more souls he hurt. And so has Hazel Grace said, It is better to be loved deeply not widely."
5," This novel has made me cry more  tears than probably any other book. Do not be doped into believing this is any other cancer book because it certainly is not. It is full of love, wit and heart ache. This book will change your perspective on life itself. I recommend this to anyone who is an advanced reader. I love this book."
5,"ll be honest, this review could be a little biased because John is my favorite writer, but I completely fell in love with the characters in this book. It is truly his best work to date, I can't recall a book that made me laugh just as much as it made me cry. I would recommend this book to anyone. Don't hesitate to buy it."
5," Well it's definitely a tear jerker, but it's a wonderfully written book. The characters are very likeable, and its a very easy read. There's some great quotes and interesting perspectives on life and illness and the marks we leave on this world. I've already recommended it to friends and let my mother steal it on her iPad."
5," This is a book about kids with cancer. But it is so witty and heartfelt. I really enjoyed getting to know the characters, follow their lives and was completely engrossed in the story. I didn't want to put the book down, but closer to the end, I kept putting my kindle down because I didn't want it to end. What a great read!"
4," found this book to be okay. As a thirty something year old mother, I related more to the parents in this book than to the main characters.  I did like the love story in this book as it was very sweet, but I think overall I found this book to be a little depressing. The ending was pretty ironic....  I'll leave it at that!"
5," John Green did a fantastic job writing from the perspective of a teenage girl with stage IV cancer.  I enjoyed reading the book very much and could hardly believe the turns the story took.  I didn't love the writing style, which is why I didn't give 5 stars.  But I did love the story, and I did actually cry while reading."
2," Bought this for my daughters, but they are a little young for some of John Green's books, so I read it first.  I really loved this story, and devoured it in two days while on vacation.  By the end, I was crying my eyes out, which I just don't do often when reading.  It's a great story, and Mr. Green is an amazing author."
4," This book made me feel so many different emotions all while enjoying a beautiful love story between two perfect characters, John green really knows what he's doing. I would recommend this book to people who want a good romantic story while also seeing that there is still hope in this world. I'm so excited of the movie!!"
5," loved the fault in our stars because it was realistic. It was a beautiful story and taught me a lot about everything, and just life in general. I'm sad it had to end. I really got attached to the characters almost like they were my friends, and I cared about them. Truly an amazing story, I will probably read it again."
5," There's not much I can say about this book. It says everything necessary in it's beautifully arranged words. While I cannot say much about such a remarkable piece of literature, I can say this:The essence of humanity has been captured by the art of John Green. I will carry this story's lesson with me always."
5," This book made me cry.  Not once, but multiple times.  My 12-year old just finished reading it for class and I have no idea how she and all of her classmates made it through this book without breaking down. More mettle than I am made of apparently.  Beautiful, sophisticated, honest, and philosophical. Outstanding book."
5," Simply amazing I. can tell that it's the type of book you can revisit over and over again. Thank you, John Green, for making this young girl (and young man for that matter) have a brain in her head. Not just senseless listing after a boy because he is pretty. This book is wonderful. I would give it 10 stars if I could."
5, chose this rating because this book is a book that you just can't put down. I bought this book on Sunday an finished it Tuesday morning. I literally could NOT put it down. If you like books that you can't put down read this one. Augustus and Hazel`s love is just the most perfect love. Good job John Green. Great book.
5," Teenaged lovers support one another through life threatening health issues in the most mature fashion ever. Friends become lovers and it is a very tender, bittersweet struggle that they embrace with unbelievable courage and strength. A strange old man adds additional tension to the story. A very heartfelt, tender read."
5," This book was beautifully written and is one of the greatest books I have ever read. It has all the components of a fantastic novel. Romance, tragedy, and so much more. This book is a book that you buy at the store, reread it all the time, and save it so that you can share with others. I would recommend it to everyone."
5," This book was by far one of the most well written books I've ever read. It had not only moments of sadness but moments of pure happiness and bliss, and I don't think I've ever had  a book make me feel everything this book has. If you're debating whether or not to get this...make sure you do, and enjoy every word of it."
2,t took me over 2 yrs and a movie to finally get up enough guts to read this book and I'm so glad I did.  What an absolutely beautiful and brilliant story of 2 people falling in love despite their illness.  I don't think any girl alive could resist the wonderful spirit that is Augustus Waters.5+++ stars!!!
5," read this book in just a few days.  It's a very quick read.  The author does a great job bringing the characters to life.  I really felt for them.  I felt for the parents.  I cried like a baby at the end.  As wonderful as this story was, I have no desire to see the movie.  I don't need to have my heart broken again."
5, LOVE this book!!! It's great I was crying laughing i really felt like I was in hazel place.I have so many good things to say about this wonderful book I just don't know haw to say say them.I want to thank John Green for writing this wonderful book it is so good I wish it went on forever.thankyou so much!
4," couldn't put this down for three quarters of my reading, and then I did for less than 24 hours because I didn't want my reading to end. I see why my students fell in love with this novel. It's a beautiful, idealistic tragedy. A story you won't soon forget. Excellent read for teens, but even as an adult, I was moved."
5, devoured this book. I didn't actually think I would like it even though it was on my recommendations list. It just didnt seem like my type of book. I usually enjoy tween supernatural stuff. But I was desperate for something to read so I just downloaded this and am so glad I did. I loved the characters and the story.
5," The only flaw in this book was, simply, it ending. This story was one deeply rooted  in the complicated intricacies of human sentience, leaving  me feeling empty after I had finished.... Leaving me to ask myself the notorious question : what do I do now that I've finished a book that no other could ever measure up to?"
5," This is truly one classic novel.  I was moved, enlightened and entranced by this beautiful story about life, living, dying and wishing. I laughed, I cried and I allowed myself to face the grief that I had hidden away for so long.  This book was my cure for the cancer of grief that I have carried in my heart for years."
5," couldn't wait to read this book. After John read the first two chapters online, I couldn't wait to read chapter three. Once I started reading I didn't put this book down until four hours later. It was an amazing read! I can't believe how attached I grew towards Hazel and Augustus. I can't recommend this book enough!"
5," This book is definitely worth your time, money and emotions. I include emotions because it will connect you and force you to feel all of them. This is the first book that made me both cry(to the point where someone made a Niagara Falls reference or seven) and laugh out loud.This book is an experience worth having."
5," As a male this isn't something I would typically read, but I'm very impressed with Green's way of capturing the life of a teenage girl who happens to be terminally ill. I loved all the metaphors and philosophical viewpoints; they really allowed me to view the world in a different way!Hope to see the movie soon!"
2, choose this rating because the movie and the book is fantastic it only took me two days to read the book  because it was so good I just couldn't put the book down it has some mild language but I still loved it There were parts when I cried because it was so touching and I think this is still the best book I've read
5," This is such a beautiful story. I have never read one quite like it. I cried and laughed. I loved all the characters. I cannot wait to see the movie that just came out but I am doubting that it will be as good as this book was. It was just one of those books that makes you look at life, love and the world around you."
5," OMG THIS BOOK IS AMAZING I MEAN I COULDN'T KEEP MY EYES OF OF THE PAGE I JUST LOVE IT I AM AND WILL WATCH THE MOVIE XD BUT I'M SERIOUS IT'S VERY BEAUTIFUL, SAD, AND LOVING I WAS SO MAD TO FIND OUT THIS ONE PART OF THE BOOK ABOUT GUS BUT I LOVE IT SO FREAKING MUCH I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE WHO LIKES &lt;&lt;-- TO READ"
5," liked this book, it had a very sad ending,yet very emotional.This book interested me so much that when a character died, I started crying. I like this author and his book.If you read Divergent or The Hunger Games, this book is for you.SPOILER: IF YOU ARE A FAIRY TALE/ HAPPY ENDINGPERSON DO NOT READ THIS"
5," This book it was mere truth and honesty as are all of John Greens books. Truly relatable in everyday sense and its not just one the cancer stories where two people meet and fall in love or whatever, well it is in a literal sense, but it hits many other things than just that and it makes you think and its fascinating."
5," To me, this book will always be special for one simple reason: as a sixteen-year-old male, this is the very first book I have read that made me cry. John Green has really outdone himself on this one, and I would highly reccomend this to anyone that wants a funny, thought-provoking, damn near perfect piece of awesome."
5," Yes- all the hype is true: this book is a wonderful read. Riveting, touching, and at times, tough to get through but worth every year that may surface.  I picked it up to help me understand the death of my dear cousin at 27 from Lupus, and it did that and so much more. Stop reading this review and get your copy now!"
5," Reading this book was a journey. It too me through so many emotions.. love, scared, anger. It reminded me that it's okay to be human and that you do not need to create a fairy tale version of this life for yourself.. but a real one full of truth. 5 stars. great read. one of my favorites by far. thank you John Green."
5,"ve wanted to read this book because of how popular it is on tumblr for weeks now and I read it in a day. TFiOS was such a great book and had such a wonderful plot. There's not many books that can make me cry, but this one definitely made me cry. Thank you John Green for such an awesome book, yet horribly sad book."
5," This is the first book I have read by this author and I will definitely be reading more. Very easy to read, yet still quite intellectual in its wording. Overall a great story about two teens with cancer who fall in love. It sounds depressing, and I guess it was in a way, but it was also uplifting. Highly recommended"
2, This book was absolutely wonderful. I did not want to put the book down the whole time I read it! You will become emotionally invested in each and every character in the book and it will make you laugh and cry. Sometime you will be laughing and crying at the same time. Don't pass up an opportunity to read this book.
5," usually do not read books like this. I barely read the blurbs that go with books, so I did not know that I picked up a cancer book till I read it. The twist  of this book is good, the Sharp  conversations  and good writing style make this all work. I just knew it would have an abrupt end. It's all good.  Thank You"
5," knew about 11 pages in that I was reading a masterpiece. Half way through it became one of my favorite books of all time. The writing is so funny, so profound, and so sad. I loved this book. It's now my go to for bday presents because everyone should have the experience of reading The Fault in our Stars."
5," This book came with rave reviews which had me salivating. I began reading with great eagerness, but found myself slowing down after the third or fourth chapter as it turned into a pretty typical tearjerker about a super-spunky but very sick child. The plot was predictable and the outcome even more so. Not impressed."
5," wasn't sure what to think at first. I heard about it because a movie is being made about it, and I am a movie/book junkie..lolBut I really felt for hazel, she has so much to overcome and yet she has done it. I just wonder about then ending though.. what happened to her? I can only assume and make my ending."
3, This is just one of the few books I've read that have actually been able to bring tears to my eyes while still feeling triumphant. It was humorously sad and almost makes me hope that I had cancer. Which is stupid I know but that's just how strong this book is. Highly recommend. It leaves its own scar in this world.
4," There are some books that are read just to be read; books that never inspire love or grace, simply hold attention and then are forgotten once their covers close. TFIOS is not one of those books. I read the entire thing in about five hours, and by the end, I was absolutly humbled by every gift of life I have. dftba."
5," *Note: I debated long and hard whether or not to write/ post a review of this book (mainly because my opinion of it is different from that of the large majority)- it was only after having spoken/ been encouraged by a fellow book blogger that I decided to do so.*I recently picked this book up after seeing tons of Tweets and blog posts telling me (or, you know, just people in general) that I HAD TO READ THIS BOOK BECAUSE IT IS QUITE LITERALLY THE BEST THING SINCE SLICED BREAD- ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT? SCREW SLICED BREAD, IT'S EVEN BETTER THAN THAT! But after reading it, I must admit, that I am a bit disappointed.I think that my largest complaint about this book was the characters- I understand that Hazel and Augustus have had to mature quicker than their peers because of their circumstances- but seriously? I would consider myself to be a somewhat educated person and I had no idea what they were saying half of the time (admittedly, I did pull out a dictionary here and there and I did reread entire portions of the book multiple times to have a better comprehension of what was going on). At time while listening to their speeches I felt like I was sitting in one of my lectures with one of my pretentious forty + year old (NOTE: not 16 year old) professors droning on and on about something inconsequential that they think is profound.Also, I really, really, really wanted to cry while reading this book and I didn't (which let me tell you, isn't all that difficult of a task because I cry like it's nobody's business- that Tim Horton's commercial where the Haitian man welcomes his family to Canada? I cried. That Tropicana orange juice commercial where the company provided Alaska with a fake sun during their 24-hour nighttime? I bawled like a baby. And don't get me started on when a family member- especially children- visit competitors on shows like Survivor- I am an absolute puddle and it takes me forever to compose myself). I think that why I didn't cry is because I just knew that someone was going to die (I mean, it is a cancer book)- perhaps had the synopsis been more mysterious (like the synopsis of Little Bee by Chris Cleave, We don't want to tell you too much about this book. It is a truly special story and we don't want to spoil it. Nevertheless, you need to know something, so we will just say this: It is extremely funny, but the African beach scene is horrific. The story starts there, but the book doesn't. And it's what happens afterward that is most important. Once you have read it, you'll want to tell everyone about it. When you do, please don't tell them what happens either. The magic is in how it unfolds.) what occurred it in would have taken me more by surprise (I would have been less prepared for what was going to happen) and as a result, tears would have trickled down my face, as I had so wanted them to?That being said, I did love the parts of the book when Augustus and Hazel dropped the facade and just let themselves be teenagers- I just found these parts to be genuine and something that I could truly connect to and understand. This part especially:  He's not that smart, I said to Julie.  She's right. It's just that most really good-looking people are stupid, so I exceed expectations.  Right, it's primarily his hotness, I said.  It can be sort of blinding, he said.  It actually did blind our friend Isaac, I said.  Terrible tragedy, that. But can I help my own deadly beauty?  You cannot.  It is my burden, this beautiful face.  Not to mention your body.  Seriously, don't get me started on my hot bod. You don't want to see me naked, Dave. Seeing me naked actually took Hazel Grace's breath away, he said, nodding toward the oxygen tank.' (pg. 251).All in all, I wish that this book was more accessible and more suited for the targeted audience- my younger sister (who fits smack-center into the targeted audience) is a HUGE fan of Lurlene McDaniel and her cancers books and I would love to have her read this book, but I know that she, too, would have difficulties trudging through it and that the large majority of it would go over her head (which I don't mean in any offense to her). In all honesty, I am on the fence about whether or not I will pick up another John Green book after having read this."
5," This book was too personal for me. It reminded me a lot of Esther, probably because I saw her dedication at the beginning and couldn't stop thinking about her after that, but I also know what it feels like to be dying. I know what it's like to feel like a grenade and this book just hit me hard. It was very well written, I'm a huge fan of John's style of writing, and it made me feel things the way a good book is supposed to make one feel, yet it only depressed me. I did not put this book down and walk away happy, but I still loved it. I recommend it to everyone! If you don't mind crying a lot."
5," First, you should know that I have never written or posted a book review in my life. But after devouring this book in less than 12 hours, I could not help but share my feelings with the world in the hopes that more people will be able to enjoy the gift that is John Green's The Fault in Our Stars. Hazel Grace Lancaster's says this of her favorite book: And then there are books like 'An Imperial Affliction', which you can't tell people about, books so special and rare and yours that advertising your affection feels like a betrayal. Well. At the risk of such betrayal, I cannot help myself: The Fault in Our Stars is undeniably one of the best books I have ever read. I was so connected with the characters and the story that at one point while reading, I won't say which point because I would never spoil this for anyone, I had to stop reading. That may sounds strange, but the fact is that I didn't WANT to find out what happened next because I knew how much it would hurt. I feared for these characters in a book who are not in any way real. This book opened what felt like a black hole in the pit of my stomach, and I can honestly say that since finishing it I have not gone one hour without thinking about it some more. As I carried it with me through the hallways of my highschool, I looked at the people around me and thought to myself: They don't know. They have NO idea of the things happening to me right now. They don't know what a story they are missing in their lives. So here it is, plain and simple: do not do yourself the disservice of not reading this book. It will change you and shake you and break your heart."
2," John Green, at his best, spans the range of human emotion, from ecstatic joy to crushing pain, this is the true genius of John Green: to write a weird story that can span that range.  The Fault in Our Stars is about a teenage girl with terminal cancer who falls in love with someone, in a story about death, the fragility of human life, and the ability to capture our memories forever.  Of course, there are weird moments along the way, and a few laughs.The reason this is a 4 star instead of a 5 star book is because the joy and witty humor John displays at his best is somewhat missing from this novel.  This is not a light hearted novel.  It hits hard and is raw, filled with emotions and the heaviness of the questions it asks.  A must read for teenagers looking for a deep novel."
5, oh my god!!! the letter. I want this love I want that. everyone leaves a mark on the world and this story was amazing. I avoided it for so long and I am ever so grateful my dear friend forced me to. words cannot express my feels on this book. I could read it a thousand times over. everyone deserves that love once.
4, This book features the honest life of two teens with cancer an there is literally no better way of describing it then reading the book yourself! I would recommend reading the book before watching the movie. The movie was a little vague in some spots and reading the book first would result in you understanding more
5," The protagonists are a bit too cutesy in their dialogue, but I'll take my heroes intelligent over dumbed-down any day. Everyone in this book is portrayed just so realistically, and flawed. I laughed out loud so many times, especially in discussions of the Literal Heart of Jesus.  Charmingly, heart-stompingly good."
5, Sensitive and funny and sweet and insightful and sad and thoughtful -- and fabulous!!  I read it on my kindle but bought the hardcover so I'd have it to read bits and pieces of whenever I want to which seems to be often.  It may be a Young Adult book but I don't know an Old Adult who's read it who hasn't loved it.
5," OH GOD THIS BOOK IS AMAZING I LITERALLY COULD NOT PUT MY KINDLE DOWN AND I JUST FINISHED IT AND I'M CRYING. IT KIND OF JUST ENDED WITH AUGUSTUS'S LETTER, BUT I'D HAVE LIKED TO KNOW HOW LONG HAZEL LIVED AFTERWORDS, OR IF SHE HAD SOMEHOW MIRACULOUSLY SURVIVED. WOW I CAN'T STRESS HOW GREAT THIS IS. A+ JOhN GREEN, A+."
5," This was one of the best books I've ever read!I laughed, cried, smile, and couldn't wait to see the characters unfold. This type of book isn't usually the kind I would normally go for but it was a great read. After reading life really gets put into prospective! I would recommend to anyone looking for a good story!"
5," had this book recommended to me by a friend and I have to say that I was initially put off by what is a very dark subject but I am so glad that I went ahead and read it. Well written and sensitively portrayed, the story is a life affirming gem but, be warned, you will need to keep a box of tissues close at hand."
5, The beginning to middle of the book is very slow. I had heard that this was a tragic book but I just couldn't get to it i was so bored. The characters just talk about symbolism and it made me so uninterested by the plot. I actually put the book down and did not finish it which was completely unlike me in any way.
5," started reading this book not really sure of what would happen. I had read a few quotes and had a general idea of what it was about, but I have to say.... no description or review can do this book justice. The story is so so beautiful and rich.DEFINITELY  (and highly) recommend this book!. Fantastic read!"
2," This book was an incredible read; simply amazing.  Heartbreaking yet comedic - this book is a must read.  I finished it in just over two sittings, wishing I had hundreds more pages of Hazel, Gus, and Isaac.Looking forward to seeing how the movie plays out.Read this book, and pass it along!"
5," am a teenager and I will say this is one of the best, if not THE best, book I have ever read.  In school they give us books to read that has no emotion or a deeper level of thought put into it.  I only wish that these are the kind of novels we are required to read.  I will definitely be reading this book again."
5, When told this was a story about two teens with cancer I thought this would be a real downer of a story and was reluctant to read it. Was I ever wrong! It is an excellent story of two exceptional teens and beautifully written. Excellent vocabulary with very perceptive character development. I highly recommend it.
5," “Sometimes, you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book.”This is a quote from TFiOS, and it sums up quite nicely exactly how I feel about it. A must-read."
5," saw a title I recognized on my computer, but didn't remembering it. Decided to take a chance and quickly fell under the spell of this beautiful and frustratingly sad little novel. ended up crying like a baby. Very thankful that someone with access to my account thought to buy this book. It is a wonderful read."
5," had been interested in reading this after hearing from others, and of course with the movie now coming out.  After recent losses to cancer, and as a parent,  I was deeply affected, in a good way, although I cried my eyes out.  I haven't had much time lately to sit down and read, thank you for bringing me back."
5,"n the beginning of the book I wasn't exactly sure if I would like this book. But as Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters grew farther and farther in love, I became in love with the book. I just absolutely love the way John Green takes a serious matter and makes it have a sense of humor. I recommend this book highly."
5, absolutely fell in love with this book. It's obvious that the  book was brilliantly thought out and beautifully told. The vocabulary is also extraordinary. You can learn 5 New words in 1 page. It has the most touching quotes I have ever read and is one of my all-time favorite books. You totally should read it.
5," This is one of the best books I have ever read. Its nit only good because of the story line, but the connection you build with the characters. This is the kind of book that you know the author had to have cried while writing it, and that makes me appreciate it even more. It gives you a different outlook on life."
5, This book was an amazing gift that  was recommended to me- a true gift! It was beautifully written and offered an insight into processing how tragic and beautiful our lives can be.  I am very grateful for the author writing a book that made laugh out loud while crying. Definitely a worthwhile experience to read.
2," This book leaves you speechless. Every word has you wondering what will happen. I love it. I finished it in 3 days, never putting it down. Words can't describe how great it is. It is one of those books that is always on your mind, all day and all night, just begging to read it. I WANT A SEQUEL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5, This book is truly amazeing its not your tipical sappy romance about love struck teeny boppers that makes you wannna barf no its so cool how these two bond over cancer!!!!! They did and it was so wonderfull i litterally laughed a couple of times and even got choked up. You will most definattly love this book!!!!
5," So  i hate reading. But I picked up this book out of my mom's office, didn't think I would've finished it, but I loved it. Never have  I ever cried while reading a book, but tonight  as I read page 261, the years streamed down. If you ever need a good book, read this book. You will not regret it  I promise  you."
5," have been an avid John Green reader for several years, and I've read Looking for Alaska, Will Grayson Will Grayson, An Abundance of Katherines and Paper towns. But let me just say, The Fault In Our Stars has been the best one yet! If you're on the fence about reading it, read it, you will not be disappointed."
5, The Fault In Our Stars is an amazing heart wrenching novel and will forever be my favorite book. I have read it close to 10 times yet i love it more each time and it never fails ti make me cry for about the last 50 pages. No other book i have ever read comes close to this amazing work and i hope none ever will.
5," This book is thoroughly engaging, wonderfully philosophical, and surprisingly inspiring.  I do not want to give it away in the review, but this is an excellent story, gracefully told with incredible skill.  I recommend it for all readers.  My 13 year old daughter also read it and thought it was very, very good."
5,"ve read this book three times in the last than 6 months. Each time I read it I find something else to love. You will laugh, you will cry, and every book you read after it will seem disappointing (the only downfall of this novel). I would review further but I don't think it's necessary. Buy the book and enjoy."
5," was prepared, but this book still broke my heart.This is the book I wanted Looking for Alaska to be. It had some similarities, the same story in some ways, but... so much more. I Love Hazel, I love Gus, two characters that might at any point slip off the page and live in our world (cancer free!!)."
5," A beautifully written book about life, death, and love. It shows through the s***tiest health conditions of two bright individuals how they accept death and what comes with it. Amazing read and inspirational. With this note in mind I would like to thank John Green and recommend this book to anyone with a heart."
5," That a book makes me both laugh out loud and cry my eyeballs out over the space of a couple hundred pages.  This book did just that, on more occasions than one.  It hurt to read sometimes, but what good book doesn't?  I love John Green's work, so I had high expectations for this book.It didn't disappoint."
2," want to start out by saying this is an amazing book. I read it all in one sitting just as most people do with this book and I loved the humor and tragedy. It is so realistic and can give you sort of a feel of what Cancer Kids are going through. I'm beginning another John Green book, Looking for Alaska, now!"
5," This book is amazing. There is comedy and tragedy. Even though I cried so much, I still love this book. John Green is an amazing writer, on one page, there can be a wise quote, but there are those other pages where you find something that will make you laugh so hard. This is one of my all time favourite books."
5," was hooked from page one. This story was humorous and horribly sad. It was real. No sugar coating just real tragic life. I hope the film does the book justice because this story was phenomenal. I loved every character, including the insufferable Van Houten. I felt their pain and their joy. Superb writing...."
5," The title says it all but overall it is a fantastic read, Mr. Green displayed a wonderful insight to the remaining days of two teenagers.. At first I was hesitant but then my friend introduced me to it and I couldn't put the book down for a whole day! Once I finished it and I cried so much but it was worth it."
5, mean it when I say this changed me this book made me really think about how there are all the things we really need to see but we just don't.  Part of me wants to say this is a very bad book because it made me cry. But it was beautiful. And that's all I can really say about it everyone should read this book.
5," From the outset, this book had me turning from page to page until I came to the end.  The story is well-crafted and kept me engaged the entire time.  The writer does an outstanding job of attending to the nuances that are present when someone is dying.  Twisted my heart and gave me hope, both at the same time."
5," had heard of this book, and was interested in reading it, but our school district has recently lost two teens to cancer, so I was worried that it would be too hard to read. I'm so glad that I gave in and read it! Although the topic is difficult, it is handled with humor and honesty. I couldn't put it down."
5," Why? Why not just read this book. Not enough reviews will be able to even begin at how astoundingly beautifying this book is. So, go on and buy it, read it, and have your heart racing along with a few tears. There's a reason why this is one of the best books of the year and so, go on and find out the reason."
5, When i read the premise of the book I thought it would be kind of depressing. I bought it bc a friend of mine highly recommended it. What a beatiful book. Two adolescents and some much wisdom. In the midst of such terrible things happening to them they find love and happiness. Absolutely a wonderful reading.
5, This book was one of the best I've ever read which took me a whole 2 days to do so. I got so emotionally invested in the characters that my heart almost literally broke for the both of them. I would recommend this book to anyone that reads like I do. I fell in love with it just as anyone who reads it will!!!
2," absolutely adored this book. It's so much better than the teenage angst I find myself reading all the time. The dialogue was so surprisingly witty and deep. It really makes you think about, well, everything. As a writer I find myself in awe and in envy at this literary genius I am very lucky to have found."
5, was diagnosed with stage IV cancer a little over a year ago and I both love and hate my brother for recommending this book to me. I hate him because it hit so close to home very accurately and I love him for recommending it for exactly the same reason. It gave me a kind of peace as I cried my way thru it.
5," Wow. I read the entire book in one afternoon because I couldn't put it down! And I was a crying, laughing idiot through most of the second half. It's not just a sad cancer story, though. These characters are just amazing and the story is so well written.This book definitely lives up to the hype."
5, This book is nothing short of amazing! I love John Green and the way he uses words. The Fault In Our stars immediately became my favorite book. I've read it twice now and plan to read it so many more times. Your heart aches for the characters. You fall in love with them. I never ever wanted the book to end.
5, gave this book to a friend as a gift. I read it on my Kindle and enjoyed it so much that I wanted to spread the love. Green's writing is nothing short of amazing. I could not put my copy down and finished it within 48 hours of it being sent to my kindle. I highly recommend this novel to anyone of any age.
5," CRIED through much of this book and at times wanted to  throw it at the ground and run from it. A good book leaves you thinking because you feel it. This book is sobering yet holds a whimsical love story. You feel their desperation and share in that anxiety, but understand that everything comes to an end."
5," Although insightful, it was hard to believe that teenagers would have the extensive vocabulary used in this book. Also, I was put off by the excessively vulgar language used by the author. Unfortunately a book about young cancer patients cannot help being depressing and I was glad when I finished the book."
5," The last book by Green I read was Paper Town, and boy o boy what an entertainer it was. And this one is even better, the best thing about john has been his mastery with words, those quotes that touches your heart. Here again in this book he pulled out some of those memorable quotes. Marvellous, I am a fan,"
2," this was a quick read. even though i'm an adult, i still love reading young adult books. this book was an easy read, and kept my attention throughout. considering the subject matter (cancer), i knew the book wasn't going to be completely happy. the storyline progressed fast and the characters were likable."
5," This book completely shattered me. It broke me into pieces and I think it may take awhile for me to get over this book. I seriously have never cried so much while reading. The Fault In Our Stars is an amazing story about love, loss, and so much more. Although, it is a sad story you won't regret reading it."
2," Gripping, funny, sad...teenagers with cancer in a story where cancer is the elephant in the room, but it's acknowledged as a fact of life (and death) and the reader is never made to feel sorry for any of the characters.  Really well-written with characters that you come to care for.  I highly recommend it."
5," Easy read about a teen's bout with cancer and her journey to make friends and have an adventure before she dies.The story also appreciates literature and wittiness among teens who are facing tough challenges.While this is NOT a depressing story, you may need a tissue at the end.  Ages 14 and up"
5, Excuse me while I sit in a corner and cry. This is my first book by John Green but it won't be my last. One of the first lines is: Like: Congratulations! you're a woman. Now die. Lines like this and characters like theses make this novel so amazing. Last thought: My must read book for everyone out there!
5," The Fault In Our Stars was an amazing read. This coming from a 13 year old. I found the story to be complex and interesting and downright amazing. The relationship between Hazel and Augustus made my heart melt. Two star-crossed lovers bound together by cancer, love, and books. Definitely my favourite book."
5, this book was recommended to me by my granddaughter who saidit was the best thing she'd read in a long time. it was intelligent andsensitive and handled important topics like illness and death in anappropriate and feelingful way in addition to friendship and romance foryoung people.
5," This well written book from the view point of a teenager with cancer feels both honest and real withoutthe over-played self-pity or heroism in other works.  I would recommend it to anyone.  My 12 year old sonlovedit, my 70 year old mother loved it, my 15 year old daughter loved it and so did I!"
5," didn't know what to say about this book. It's just amazing. I have read this book multiple times now and both times I have been impressed. There may be some sad moments, but the good ones outweigh those. The characters are so realistic and that is why anyone and everyone should read and enjoy this book."
5," Touching, no, not quite the right word, more than that...beautiful!We all know we are going to die eventually, but I suppose this brings the reality closer, yet brings the beauty of love and ephemeral relationships back to square one.Not suspenseful, not a thriller, but charming and beautiful!"
5,"m not one to be particularly drawn to cancer books with their melancholy stories...But, The Fault in Our Stars is a terrific read. This book is a smooth easy read as well as it is complex and proposes many in depth observations on life, death, and love. I was attached to my kindle until I finished it."
5, This book made me laugh out loud one minute and sink to the bottom of heartache in the next paragraph. I usually steer away from teenage angst stories but the author pulled me in  on the first page and I never regretted a moment of it. There is so much going on in the story that provides a memorable read.
2, One of my high school students suggested this book.  I bought her one for a graduation present and one for myself.  After reading through it in 2 days and left with smiles and tears I have to say it is an outstanding book.  Very well written and a great perspective through the eyes of a child with cancer.
5," First read it when it first came out, now just finished it for the third time. This book gets all the better with each re-reading -- The emotions are conveyed so eloquently through the characters that you feels its power every single time. Splendid book, absolutely recommend to anyone, both old and young."
5," At first I read it up until Hazel didn't like V for Vendetta, because who doesn't like V for Vendetta??? It's a classic movie that is so not a dude film.It took me a couple of days to get over that, but I read the rest in a night and... oh my god, I was a wreck. Thank you, John Green, for all the feels."
5," This book made me think and question life as a whole. Green is a brilliant and intelligent writer. I cannot wait to buy and read more of hi  beautiful words. Thank you, Green, for being so real about cancer , we all like to bury the harsh realities of the disease, but i think it is better to reveal them."
5," fell in love with Hazel Grace and Augustus and I fell hard once I came to the realization that I was undeniably going to get hurt. It was an amazing story on life, love, pain and joy. I cried like a little girl and yet felt so hopeful by the end of the book and Augustus last words. Absolutely loved it!"
5," The Fault in Our Stars. I wanted to love this book considering all friends' reviews and given the fact that I just recently lost someone to cancer. Characters were likable enough but I couldn't buy into the way these two spoke. Just don't think teens, smart or genius, would speak to one another this way."
5," find myself reading reviews of THE FAULT IN OUR STARS online, but while I enjoyed that book (I still need to reread it again),I can't help but wander over to reviews of LOOKING FOR ALASKA yearning to reread it for the 5th time.  I think the major difference was that I felt like LOOKING FOR ALASKA was mine, something I found and could cherish and analyze personally, while THE FAULT IN OUR STARS had to be shared, especially with those intimately linked to cancer (unlike myself).  Possibly it was the hype that made TFIOS not live up to my expectations, but I think that it was also missing something John Green-esque.  Something that questioned life and how we live it and how it will be when life ends.  I LOVE John Green and I think TFIOS for most was just what they were looking for, but for me it lacked a sense of relate-bility.  Why is it that when Augustus dies of cancer, Hazel (also with cancer) doesn't question death or life after death, as Miles does of Alaska in Looking for Alaska? Possibly because she too faces the same fate."
3," How a man can so easily grasp a teenage girls point of view amazes me, let alone a teenage girl dying of cancer.  The story flows seamlessly and more quickly than I expected, and maybe more quickly than I wanted. His descriptions of their interactions made you fall in love right along with them...bravo!"
3," This is the best book I've ever read and I don't see how the movie could be better. This book is definitely a must read, in fact I'm going to reread it right now. I definitely recommend this book to anyone, girl or boy with a high reading level. It actually became kind of a challenge, but in a good way!"
5," really enjoyed this book. It was sad, I'll give it that, but I think given the content is expected. I am not much of a crier, but there were several times when I teared up, especially near the end. All that aside, I think the book makes some valid points and tackles a pretty touchy subject with class."
2, added this book to my Kindle before taking a trip.  I couldn't put it down and went through a wide variety of emotions while reading it.  I don't want to mention the plot too much because I think it is best that the reader just take a journey with these young people.It was a life-changer for me.
4, This is a book one must read. I loved it it was easy to read and very interesting at the same time. Doesn't get bored and makes you a little more human to feel others's pain and love. I actually didn't want it to have an end but everything in life does. I highly recommend this book. Absolutely loved it.
5," don't even know what to say about this book. It's sad like any cancer story, but it's nothing you'd ever expect and more than you could ask for. Hopeful, but not the way you think. It's the kind of book that doesn't necessarily make you believe in love or God, but it makes you want to believe in both."
5," This book had me sobbing in the most randomness parts. I can very much say that it has me thinking of what could actually happen when people die, beck when I did even. But this book about teenagers with cancer but in love at the same time is a perfect read for those interested in things of those nature."
5, C
5," After having read two of John Green 's books, I realize that what I like about his books is that the teenagers are so intelligent and well-read. It was interesting reading this as a grown woman with children. I imagine I read it completely differently than a teenager would. Wonderful book for all ages."
5," This is my all time favorite book. It is the only book that has ever made me cry, but it is soooo worth reading. They are actually even making a movie of this book, scheduled to release in 2014 in USA. The book came to me in absolutely perfect condition, i HIGHLY recommend buying and reading this book!"
5," have read this novel, as well as a few others by John Green, several times, but this novel is by far my favorite. John Green's writing style and clever wording continues to amazing me every time I pick up a copy or read it via the Kindle app. Definitely a 5 star worthy book that everyone should read!"
5, Simply amazing!Very well written and with characters that seem very real. You're happy when they're happy and you're heart breaks with theirs.I honestly think that this is John Greens best work yet. This book touched me in a way that hasn't happened in years. The bar has been set very high.
5, Loved the characters and the writing. I am going to reread it because I don't want to miss a thing. I do find it hard to believe that real teenagers would talk the way Hazel and Gus do but it is integral to the story. My life has been changed in a positive way by this book...I think your's will be too.
2, This book had me riveted right from the get go! the writing is superb the topics discussed universal (no pun intended) and the characters felt so alive it was painful to witness them falling in love.  A wonderful story about the real issues that affect one when death comes to visit. Highly Recommended.
5, This book will make you laugh and it will make you cry. It will make you think about life in a whole new way. I can only speak for myself but it definitely stays with you long after you finish reading. And if you like this book then go buy his other book 'looking for alaska' it is just as well written.
5," read the book on my teenage daughter's recommendation.  While the topic (kids with cancer) initially was a downer, the author created realistic and wonderful characters to explore the topic.  The characters were engaging and a sensitive topic was handled with both insight and depth.  Glad I read it."
5," This book is perfect. This is my second time through and I foresee it becoming my own Imperial Affliction - I'll be reading it for years to come.Thank you, John Green, for writing this book, but I'm not going ask you what happens to the others. What happened to Hazel is good enough for me."
5,f you ever like to read books that make you sit back and think about the world through another perspective this is the perfect book to read. I have never felt more real life emotion from a book. Tears and bashful blushes are what make this book great. Thank you John Green for making me open my eyes.
5," put off reading this book (after my daughter read it cover-to-cover in less than 24 hours), thinking that a book about two teens battling cancer would be depressing.  So wrong! Green writes dialog so well, and though there are tough parts - you will find yourself laughing out loud more than crying."
5," couldn't put this book down and when my husband came home to find me glued to it one afternoon in tears, he said NO MORE! to which I replied, OH My Gosh, this author can write and if you would just read this you too would become so emotionally involved in the characters you would cry too."
5," When I started this book I was not sure that it was for me. Well, it only took me like 4-5 days to get through the book, but it definitely exceeded my expectations. I cried, laughed, and got angry at this book multiple times, but that's what made it great.  Well written and pulls on the heartstrings."
5, Another great book by John Green.Part of why I love him is that he writes such real characters. Both Hazel grace and Augustus waters have earned a special place in my heart. I won't put any spoilers in but it's a book that really touches you. Bravo John Bravo.Makes me proud to be a Nerdfighter.
5," loved this book! The characters were so easy to fall in love with and relate to, even as a 35 yr old (maybe because I teach middle school.) The story is one that many can relate to, either through personal experience or through others as cancer has effected nearly everyone in some way. A must read!"
2," John Green's latest book is absolutely fantastic. Having suffered through more mild medical trials myself, and watched family members and other loved ones suffer through some equaling those described in the book (and we all have), I found the characters and their family members highly understandable."
5," This book is skillfully and honestly written. It is full of eloquence and humor but not in such a way that takes away from the story. Pain and loss in life is inevitable but Mr. Green chooses not to sugarcoat either; instead he highlights his characters, their journeys and the fault in their stars"
5, was captivated by not only the story but Green's writing. It was just incredible. He dug into the situation at hand and captured the seriousness as well as some very real humor that goes along with cancer. The characters deal with things in a very real way and I so appreciated that. Awesome read!!
5," liked in the book how it was realistic because most people don't always have a happy ending, so I love how it's realistic. I also love how John Green put feeling and emotion in his writing. I recommend this book to every pre-teen and teenager in America! This book is so good and I love it so much!"
5," may only be in seventh grade but I do know a little something about books, John Green is an absolutely amazing author! he is so deep but at the same time funny. this book made me ball my eyes out, and laugh until until cried I only wish that until some day could be as talented at writing as he is."
5," laughed, cried, and just loved this book. The writing is witty and the characters felt so real that I swear I could pick up the phone, dial Hazel, and tell her what an amazing person she is. This was my first John Green book, but not my last! Looking For Alaska is next! Keep on writing Mr Green."
5,"ve you want a quick tear jerker with an amazing story line this is a perfect book for you. I found myself wanting to come home and read non-stop which is what happened. But needless to say a wonderful job by John Green, this story of his makes me want to touch people's lives that have less than I."
5," This book is not only the best book, but the most realistic. It helps you understand all of life. It definitely made an impact on me. It's a Wow because I believe you can't get any better than wow. I have and will never read a book as wow as this one. Bravo, John Green. You have done it again."
5," There is so much awesome jam packed into this novel! I don't want to spoil it for anyone, so I will offer no details on the story, but i will say that John Green has done it again! This book puts you through, as John says, ALL OF THE EMOTIONS! This book is a work of art, beautiful in so many ways."
5, John Green outdid himself. This book was probably one of the best books I've ever read. It's also one of the saddest. The saddest are the best. They prove to you how lucky you are. I'm sitting in my car in tears. I would l like to thank John Green for making this book. I will never stop reading it.
2, loved this book!  I read during my commute to and from work each day and I'm sure there were many other passengers wondering who the crazy lady was who laughed out loud (with an occasional snort :) or got teary-eyed.  I don't care...  I'm going to have a hellacious book hangover from this one....
5," The words I can use to describe this book of twist and turns will do no justice to this work of art John Green has crafted! I am a 16 year old boy, almost 17, and I recommend this to every single soul yearning for a good read. Do yourself a favor and read this, you will NOT be able to put  it down!"
5, The book was mesmerizing and I raced to read it so I could share it with friends.  The bravery of the young cancer patients and their witty summation of the treatments really made me appreciate the situation.  John Green took a sad subject and humanized it.  His other works are  on my wishlist now.
5," This is the first book by John Green that I've read and I will definitely read them all now.  The Fault in our Stars was a wonderful story, extremely well written with fantastic characters.  This is probably the best book I read in all of 2012 and I read a lot of books.  Highly recommend to anyone."
5,"m amazed the way John Green can take me to Indiana,the Netherlands, and back in just 300 pages. These characters are right up there with my favorites : Holden(Catcher in the Rye) Charlie (Perks of Being a Wallflower)and Jay (Great Gatsby). I'm glad John let us into this small infinity he created."
5," A warming love story about two young people on a journey most of us will never experience.  It took me to a place where I was able to get out of my own self and out of my own way and in to a world where different, important things matter.  I loved the characters and it the read flowed.  Thank you!"
5, just couldn't stop reading it!I usually don't like love story's that much but when I read this book it was like I was in a whole different world and it helped me understand a lot more things also so I say Thank You So Much John Green for writing this more Wonderful than words can describe Book!!
4, When I say this book was crazy awesome I cried.There were happy moments there were sad moment and romantic. I am just speechless. If the book was this good bow would the movie be.? John Green out done himself. Don't be like Van Houton MAKE A SECOND HALF OF THE BOOK PLZ. Thank you and make a series
5, This book deserves five stars because there is no bull s*** about cancer it tells it how it is and how its not always a pretty story by dying heroically and looking gorgeous.I'd recommend this book to anyone with a heart cause once you read this book you'll never look at like the same way again.
5," This book was perfect, it was real and it was sad and it was amazing. I knew it was going to be sad the entire time yet it was still sweet and won you over from the start. I would recommend this to any girl in middle school or high school, great read that kept me hooked and ended with me in tears."
2, found this book on a kindle listing and hoped for the best. I love this book. I finished it in one sitting. I could not stop reading about Hazel and Gus. It can be categorized as sad or simply a love story but I saw it as an insightful view into the eyes of the someone facing death and sickness.
5," Now I see what all the fuss is about. I think that the dialogue was what won me over. The protagonists were so bright and clever, philosophical, mathematical, charmingly nerdy and written with such emotional depth. I laughed, I cried, and I will be thinking of Hazel and Gus for a long, long time."
5," There's not much to be said about this fantastic book other than if you've never read a John Green book, this is a great one to start with. If you have, this has his imprint all over it.Fair warning, you will be embarking in an emotional rollercoaster, much like life itself."
5," You knew this story was going to be sad, but the journey that the two characters took along the way made the anticipated sadness much easier to accept.  I loved the intricate writing and the way the dialogue was full of interesting words that were sort of made up by the main characters."
5," Although a lot of the repartee was very witty. I found the book to be depressing and a downer. I know I'm in the minority here but I like to read books that inspire hope. Also, I'm puzzled by all the references lately in books and movies referring to the 'Universe' as a thinking, feeling entity."
5," This is one of the best books that I have read in a very long time. Hazel is very relatable and understood, and you cannot help but fall in love with Augustus. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a love story that has characters that you grow to love when you first read about them."
2,"t's hard to find a book that i'll actually stick with but with this one I had no problem what so ever. It had such a great story line, the characters were very well rounded, and the ending was unexpected and beautiful. This book made me laugh as much as it did cry. Great book! Highly recommend!"
5, THIS IS THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ READ IT AS SOON AS YOU CAN I READ IT IN ONE DAY AND ITS SO GOOD YOU SHOULD GO READ IT NOW ALSO WATCH VLOG BROTHERS VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE BECAUSE ITS JOHN GREEN AND HIS BROTHER AND THEY ARE HILARIOUS AND AMAZING AND ALSO READ THIS BOOK ALONG WITH ALL HIS OTHERS!
5, CHANGE THE NAME OF THE AUTHOR. HOW UNPROFESSIONAL CAN AMAZON BE? AS A LOYAL CUSTOMER AND KINDLE READER THIS MAKES ME FURIOUS. I AM GETTING RID OF MY KINDLE AND BUYING THE IPAD. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE AMAZON.
5," This book contains the sadness and joy of reality. And even the strongest men and women - weather mentally or physically - will be bawling by the time they finish this book. I crying my eyes out I finished the book, myself. The fault in our stars also includes hilarious sequences so when you re"
2," To be completely honest I hate reading, and a lot of my friends were encouraging me to read this so I thought I would give it a try..... Let me tell you... This is the best book in the whole entire world! It comes hardcover and in perfect sharpe if only I had more time to read it 20 more times."
5," My 12 year old girl is over the stars about this book.  I admit I haven't read it, but John Green's books get her to read, which unfortunately is not an easy thing to do.  Now the only problem is that she wants additional paraphenalia like shoes, bags, shirts to flaunt her enthusiasm!"
5," am not quite the target audience (i am a newlywed, 40ish former stepmom) but this was a terrific read. yes, i am aware that most teenagers aren't like these kids. my spouse works at a childrens cancer hospital and i am hopeful that my reading this lovely book will help me be a better support."
5," Okay ?Okay.This is an absolutely brilliant book by an awesome author, the one and only John Green. It's soo good. Just but it okay ?WARNING: If you do not like crying for hours on end for the intense regards you have for fictional characters; I do not suggest this book to you."
4," came across this book on chance. I trusted the thousands of reviewers to decide on a book to help soothe my saddened soul. I do not know if it is soothed, but I do know that this is quite possibly one of my favorite books. Definitely in my top 5.Read it. You won't be disappointed."
5," This novel is so heart-felt, soulful and delightful all at once.  The author captured very well the way crises in life can distill for us what is truly important.  The young characters in this book live lives with the sort of integrity we all can only hope to achieve in a long lifetime.  Bravo!"
5," While writing this review, I am balling my eyes out. This book was the best book I have ever read.. and I have read a lot of books. Even though this book was incredibly sad, it has changed my life and made me realize how lucky I am to be alive. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone"
5," purchased the book on kindle, and got a signed physical copy. I am now purchasing a third copy so that I have one to share with people. So yeah, you can say this book is kinda sorta very brilliant and awesome. Laugh to Cry ratio 1:1. Don't read in public places and keep a tissue handy!DFTBA"
5," am a huge fan of John Green, he has long been one of my favorite authors. This work is yet another example of his superb mastery of the 'coming of age tale' and of his excellent understanding of the young adult mind. I ordered this book for my kindle and could not put it down. Well done Mr. Green. DFTBA."
5," have to say I have not read a book in a very long time that touched me the way this one did.  What a blessing to be allowed to see such a pure and beautiful love shared by Gus and Hazel Grace.  And to be able to appreciate more this life that we have been given,  each and every day of it...."
2, normally go for the feel good books but this was a good one.  It made me cry and at the end I let out a sigh and thought life doesn't seem fair all the time.  I would recommend this book.  It is a unique story and sometimes we just have to accept that each of us has a different path to walk.
5, Thought I was reading a book about a girl who had cancer and was fighting it. I was not expecting a story like the one I just finished reading. It wasn't a cancer book it was a book about romance and these teens getting comfortable with their bodies and find who they are in this world of ours.
5,"ll try not to include spoilers.I loved this book. Even though I was crying before I was halfway through it and my mum demanded that the next book I read is a happy one, this is one of the best books I have ever read.To anyone who is thinking about buying this book... DO..."
5," really felt connected to this book. There is nothing I would change or add. It was sad at the end, but it was memorable and I really am glad that I read it. It made me cry , but I got the point where I fell in love with Augustus so it was hard for me to see him go even though it's not real."
5," think this is John Green's best book.  The characters are real and quirky and intelligent.  While Green might write for a Young Adult audience, this books appeals to people of all ages, because of the layers of meaning and cultural/literary allusions littered throughout.  An excellent read."
5, This story has a beauty of reality that no one can fathom for they have not lived it. It's an elegant tragedy. This book has caused me joy and pain. And we all know pain demands to be felt. I love this book. One of my favorites by far. This story has an elegance that simply cannot be ignored.
5," thought this would be an incredibly emotional book to read and while I did have a few tears throughout the book, I loved it! I think this is a youth book, but I thought the topic was really well written for a person of any age. It is a quick read, but a good one that will keep you thinking."
5," This book depicts life, love, loss with wit and humor, superb characterization, effective metaphors, and a pitch perfect tone in the dialogue. The first person narrative point of view brings the reader right into the heart and mind of the characters. I rate it among my all time favorite books"
5, loved this book. The characters were so real and honest and it made me really think about our time here on earth and what we make of it. As a teacher of teenagers I thought the author did an amazingly accurate job of portraying the teen characters. An amazingly innocent love story as well.
5," This was a book that was hard to read and in the same moment hard to put down. Knowing people that have died from cancer, my dad included, this hit very close to home. I agree there are days that if you don't laugh you'll cry. Choose wisely who you love, and who will leave their mark on you."
2," After reading this book, I felt as though I had lost a friend. I wanted to believe that Hazel would get a lung transplant and live to be an old woman, or at least outlive her parents.  The reality is, it made me  think of my own life, and that I should live every moment, like it was my last."
5," This book was real. I'll be honest, I don't know the full true meaning of that and I'm saying it so many people won't. But when you read a book like this, it changes you. It's witty and charming without darkening the subject. To everyone, this book will mean something different. Amazing book"
5," As a high school teacher, it has been an absolute pleasure to pass this book onto my students. The clever, passionate characters grab their attention from the start, and never let it go for more than 200 pages. Nothing helps young people with reading like a great book. Thank you, John Green."
5," An amazing book I loved it so much. This is just one if those books that right In the middle you stop reading it because you don't want it to end. A book of true feelings and life giving the book true character,if you don't read this book you are missing an asset to life. ( it was that good)"
5," This deserves a five out of five because this tragically romantic novel will make  you laugh, gasp, smile, frown,cry throughout the book. You will not want to put this book down whatsoever. I recommend this wonderful Novel to anybody who is into romance and understands the hardships of life."
5, This book was beautiful. I am thirteen years old and all of my friends were telling me to read it.It gave me hope for my future. I am not the prettiest or skinniest girl but I am trying to be someone I am not. I am a dancer and I am a reader it is the best book I have ever read.
5," This book is truly amazing. And it truly inspires you. I promise you will love it because I did. I loved it so much, I kept forgetting it was a book, and starting thinking this was life. And it is. Not mine. But someone else's. And just that thought makes you feel so blessed. Read the book."
5,ve been wanting to read this book since the title was announced (Nerdfighter here!) and I had finally gotten back into reading when this version was only a couple of dollars on the kindle. Suffice to say I absolutely adore this book and will probably end up buying a physical copy one day.
5,t was amazing and I was able to finish it in less than a week because of that. It is one of those books that will take  me a long time to stop thinking about it. The characters are one  I fell in love with and right now it is my favorite book and I also happy I read it. Please read it too.
5," really loved this product because it was a really well written book although sad at the end. Everyone on Tumblr talks about this book and say how good it is and I wanted to try it and I got a gift card from Christmas to amazon so I decided, why not? It also got here super fast. So thanks."
2," This book is so outstandingly written that I find it hard to believe that any person could read this and not be fully moved by this story. I want to read it an infinite number of times because I have such a refreshed outlook on life. Read this book, I promise you'll get something out of it."
5, This was a great moving and powerful story. It's about love and what you do for the person you love. John Green did a great job with his characters of Gus and Hazel. Cancer is a horrible illness and we hope to find a cure but till then there is hope and love and that is what this book has.
5," When I first saw this book, I thought it would be a cliche teen romance. It is not, it's a beautiful book that really captures cancer. No book has made me laugh, smile, and cry more. (I mean, I went through a whole bow of tissues) but nevertheless it is amazing and everyone should read it!"
5," SPOILER ALERT. John Green has the ability to make his reader both fall in love with the characters and be heartbroken by them (especially when they die). I enjoy his writing style very much as it is fresh, witty, and real. This story was not my favorite of his but I enjoyed it nonetheless."
5," The epic and brutal honestly of this book brought me to tears. It made me feel insignificant and unworthy of this life given to me, though it was in the best way. That doesn't make sense to anyone who has not read it, but complete and utter sense to those who have. Bravo, Mr. Green, bravo."
4," This is a brilliant book, told by a 16 year old with terminal cancer. The author obviously knows this world well, and he never sentimentalizes it or allows it to overwhelm his story. The Fault in Our Stars stayed with this reader long after finishing the book. Highly recommended."
5," am an AVID reader, and there have been very few books that I have come across that:a) are wonderfully writtenb) have made me laugh and cry with the charactersc) have made me think so deeply upon my own existence.5 stars, no question.Recommended to ALL."
5, just didn't really know what to expect with this story.  It was recommended to me and I couldn't put it down.This book was so well written you feel fully immersed in the characters.This author reminded me of Wally Lamb!  I will be looking for more from John Green.
5, The author succeeded in getting me inside the character's heart and mind about living with a terminal disease. I appreciated the reminder that we are all terminal and Augustus (my favorite character) inspires us to live our finite days selflessly helping others find joy in their struggles.
5,"ve never been disappointed by a John Green book. Even though this book had it's sad moments, it was still written with amazingly real emotion. The characters jumped off the page and I found myself so fond of Gus and Hazel as real people. I'll still be reading Green 's books when I'm old!"
2," The Fault In Our Stars is, by far, one of the best books I've read in a long time. John Green has really outdone himself.This is a beautiful story of life, love, and two young people trying to figure out what is life.I give this boom a million stars. Truly amazing!!"
5," This book was randomly chosen for our February girls book club and it was great!  There was a good story here that really spoke to the heart of this HS student falling in love for the first time and learning how to let go and allow herself to love, even though it's not always easy and fun."
5," Many people who I know that have read this book tell me they do not like this book because they don't understand it. Don't let these reviews turn you away from this book. It is a work of art, and only the most intuellectual readers can really appreciate it. I highly recomend reading TFIOS."
5," Alright, so I admit that I only bought this because I wanted to check this John Green dude out, but man, this was a great book. In fact, I read it in one day because I could not make myself put the book down. It's phenomenal. It's philosophical. It's heartbreakingly brilliant. A must read."
5, This book is an amazing book....I have read many books but I have never been so captured as I was with this story...I cried just like most people but in a way I was overjoyed I recommend this to adults and children that are ready for a book that we'll not be put down until it is finished.
5," Possibly not the best book to read after recently losing a loved one...however, it does give you the opportunity to let out the emotions you have been holding in since it happened as you try to participate in normal society. This book is so full of emotion, and yes, it demands to be felt."
5," am speechless. Every word in this book is pure perfection. I fell in love with Augustus and Hazel Grace the way you fall asleep: slowly, then all at once. Anyone who reads this book, has glanced at heaven in words. I know it's heaven because Augustus is in it. The book was perfection."
5," Beautiful.  Heartwarming.  Heartbreaking.  Humorous within its darkest moments, which is how we lived within the timeline of our own son.  This story made me want to curl up in someone`s lap and mourn for a life that is not and for the lives that cannot...  and for those that must anyway."
5," started reading this book and simply could not stop. The characters are enthralling and the story leaves you in a perfect place, yet still wanting more. This is the kind of book I could read over and over just to live in a world for a short time where these characters actually do exist."
5, My grandma died of cancer and I really wish she could've lived long enough to read this book. She was an amazing woman and I miss her everyday. This book made me feel like I knew a little piece of what she was going through. I hope the author writes many more books like this. Amazing job
2," didn't give this a 5 star rating because of some parts of the book.  I can't tell you exactly why because I'll be giving the book away.  The characters are very likable, the dialogue is incredible.  I would say read this and draw you're own conclusions.  It's a quick read and worth it."
5," Sad, touching, funny...great characters, well written,  thought-provoking, emotional...at least for me.  One of those books that you can't stop reading because you want to know what happens but you don't want to keep reading because you are afraid of what you are pretty sure will happen."
4," rented this book from the library a few weeks ago and loved it . I ordered it here because I want to be able to mark it up with my thoughts especially after reading John Green's FAQ about it. The book itself is in great condition, nothing is bent or folded and there are no marks on it."
5," finished this in a day. Couldn't stop reading. Truly incredible writing that brought me to tears at some points. This is an epic tale of star-crossed lovers, but not the typical Shakespearean model. I laughed, cried, and questioned the meaning of life. Thank you, John Green. Thank you."
5, A beautiful story from the point of view of a teenage girl. This is a touching and insightful book that cracks the door open into the world of children living with cancer. I have passed the book along to all three of my teenage daughters with the hope that they will be as moved as I was.
5, This book made me sob but it also opened my eyes to feelings of a dying person.  Feelings of those left behind.  I am so blessed thus far that my children have not had to live with the thought of death.  Now I gotta know.  How long does hazel live?  What does her mother do?  Her father?
5," read this book just after a relative was diagnosed with cancer, my first experience with this disease so close to home.  It is helping me cope with my fears and taught me how to talk to the patient.  I would reccommend this to anyone who wants to learn how to help someone with cancer."
5,"f the writers from 10 Things I Hate About You, Mean Girls, and Juno got together to write a cancer group love story, this might be the result. I enjoyed the snarky humor and I look forward to the movie, but I didn't find it as groundbreaking and awesome as some other people clearly do."
5, would recommend this book to everyone with a heart. Very well written and thoughtful.it makes you appreciate being human in all its loveliness and terriblousness. Have Kleenex ready for when your heart is tugged and enjoy the glorious complexity of life through the eyes of this story.
5," The Fault In Our Stars...what an amazing book! I cried through much of the story, even at the funny parts! These characters seemed so real you can't help but fall in love with them and feel exactly what they feel. I finished this book in a day, i just couldn't put it down! A must read!!"
2," This book was fantastic. John Green brilliantly narrated the story of two teenagers whose lives are far from average, without causing a wave of pity for the characters. Instead, his novel is inspiring, heartwarming, and hilariously witty. I would immediately suggest this book to anyone."
5," always describe my favorite books as feeling like home, and TFiOS is just that. It's sweet, sad, comforting, disheartening, and incredible. Clearly, it ranges the emotions and asks the reader to better understand themselves.Its beautiful, and I love it, I hope you will as well :)"
5," Mr. Green has captured the emotional essence of this true story, and I fell in love with all the characters.  How could I not be moved?  I must admit that the intellectual exchanges between the two main characters were at times abstruse, but that in itself was imaginative and wondrous."
5," This novel takes an unprecedented perspective on life, illness, love, and the defining experiences found in between.  It is engaging on a level that few literary pieces are and demands your undivided attention. I would highly recommend this to any who finds solace in perpetual thought."
5," So I didn't get the book on Amazon but i thought that I'd still be able to write a review.. I fell in love with the book as soon as I got to the second page. I usually start a book and then put it off, but I started TFIOS and couldn't put it down. Everything about this book is perfect."
5," This was such a great story. I knew it would be sad, and it was, but it was very happy at times as well. Beautifully written. I loved each of the characters. I can't wait til the movie, but will probably have to wait until it comes out on video so I don't cry the entire time in public."
5," John Green beautifully weaves the tales of cancer patients living life to the fullest. Never do you feel like these characters are fake, and you will become very invested in their lives. He does a wonderful job of making you laugh and cry at the same time. You will feel ALL THE THINGS!"
5," The moment I started the book, I was astonished. John Green did an excellent job portraying the characters and creating a story that made me cry. I love how the story ended with more of a hopeful story, rather than a cliff hanger. Now officially on the top of my list of favorite books."
5, was so intrigued by this book. I said to myself I must read this book more then once which I did. The second time I read the book was even better then these first. I contemplated how John Green writes and creates such an incredible story. I just wanted to say thanks and amazing book.
5," This book is amazing because the story is relatable, the characters are likeable, and the dialogue between them is well crafted and enjoyable. I really had a blast reading this book and couldn't wait to recommend it to my friends and family. You'll love it or I'll refund your money. :)"
2," He is just a perfect man okay and like my mom said, because she said it best, I want to write this book. I also want to have written this book, but since that's no longer possible, I'll settle for wanting to get inside Mr. Green 's head. Ughhhh this is a book I'll read again and again."
5," Probably one the most beautifully written book I have ever read. It goes through the ups and down of living and dying. How one moment can change your life. Even though in a thousand years no one will ever remember it. Oblivion, is something you should never fear because its inevitable."
5," have already read this book twice, I could not put it down each time! What most attracted me was Mr. Green 's writing. But the story itself is amazing. I cried at least 3 times. This will probably be something I'll read over and over again, such an amazing (and different) love story!"
5, Why on earth would anyone write about two teenagers with cancer who fall in love? Green reduced me to a hopeless shell of emotion on multiple occasions over the span of the one day it took me to read the final 47% of this book. I have never in my life felt so incapacitated in my life.
5," This story hooked me from the beginning. It deals with a difficult subject- kids having cáncer- but the characters and dialog are very real, not sentimental. I felt that realism lacked a little toward the end of the Book, so It rated 4 stars instead of 5. Definitely a worthwhile read."
5," Great read, I didn't expect it to be so good and it is easily one of my most favorites I've read in my lifetime. The book isn't just some romance novel or a book about hopes and miracles, it takes a complex view about the intricacies of dying and not just death. I highly recommend it."
4, loved this book because it is for anybody. It had a lot of life Lessons. I felt like I was there. I'm not a reader however John Greene knows just how to capture my attention and interest. I recommend all his books. Thank you! Watching  the movie tomorrow and hoping it's as good! :)
5, have read this book three and a half times ( I'm in the process of reading). This book just blew me away by the mere complisitness of the narrative. Every time I read it I have a new aspect of it. I LOVE this book and hope everyone will get a chance to read this heart warming tale.
5," The best story I have ever read. So touching, funny, romantic and beautiful. I read this in two days. It was THAT good. I fell in love with each character and truly hope I can fall in love with someone the way Augustus and Hazel did. Can't wait to see the movie! A must read for sure."
5," This book is probably the best book I have ever read. It made me laugh, it made me cry and it made me realize how lucky I am to have everything in my life...this book is amazing. The book is called  The Fault in Our Stars but really, there was nothing wrong with it. It was perfect."
2," What a beautiful book! The story and images and dialogue will stay with me a long time, I'm sure. Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters are such wonderful characters. Life is not a wish granting factory. You're right, John Green, but if I could wish a perfect book, this might just be it."
5," This book was absolutely amazing. John Green is such an amazing author and after reading his first novel, Looking For Alaska, I felt the need to read every book he'd ever written. I couldn't put this book down, and I am happy to say it took me less than a day to finish it. I love it."
5,"ve been hearing about this book from my 16 year old daughter... she just goes on and on about it and the movie coming out.. so i read it and absolutely LOVED it... it was a beautiful story that was superbly written...John Green blew me away...now, even I cant wait to see the movie."
5," love John Green, and this is by far his best. Where Katherines, WGWG, an paper towns fall short TFioS is a stron literally masterpiece filled with heart, a gripping storyline, and lovable characters, as well as a few gut wrenching-ly funny moment. A must read for teens and adults."
5," This is a lovely book with a compellingly readable story line, likable, believable, heart-breakingly smart and funny characters and an emotional tug that makes you think more deeply about life and its meaning. What more could anyone want? Perfect for teens but also great for adults."
5," had never read a book by John Green before, but after reading this masterpiece (in less than two days!) I have ordered some of his other works to check out as well.This book made me laugh, and turned me into a sobbing mess. It's beautifully written and is definitely a must-read."
5, This book was so detailed in love it was unbearable in the best ways. Every time I read a great book I feel incomplete because that life that I had just read just ended and there is no more to be read and it breaks my heart that this story couldn't last forever. Please read this!!!
5," Great read if...you enjoy YA novels, books about overcoming tough spots in life, making the most of the life you have, sweet romance, innocent love, plot twists, emotional reads, character driven novels, and a heart ache ending. (John Green writes very smoothly and very enjoyably.)"
5,"t's a poetic reading of an honest story, that connects with intelligence and wit a tale of love, discovery and acceptance, a great look into a vision of facts and plain happenings that both strips the pain and eases the parting of emotion, a heavy cry but a cry of understanding..."
5," Although sad, this tale of kids with cancer was well written and thought provoking.  The prose was filled with humor as well as intellectual insight on life and death and how terminal illness can affect young people.  I recommend it to anyone and I expect that I will read it again."
2, All teenagers or young adults+ should take a look at this book to see life's importance and how we all should appreciate what we have because some have worse. This book portrays many emotions and different personalities for each character. Very motivating and lovely. Well-written.
5, This novel has change a lot of what I think. I laughed and cried plenty. I loved Augustus and I loved Hazel and I wanted to be loved and to love as deeply and honestly as they love each other. Truly a hopeful novel filled joy and light. Please give yourself the gift of reading it.
5," Written from the witty point of view of a 16-year old girl, I couldn't enjoy this book more; I did suffer quite a bit more.I praise John Green for his writing, and this book opened up my eyes to the world of those who live with death like a chip on their shoulder. I love it."
5," Beautifully written and very honest about living with a terminal illness.  The characters are well drawn, humorous and insightful...and very lovable.  They have invited you on their journey and there's a lot to learn.  Not a beach book but an important book about the gift of life."
5," You would think I would be depressed reading this...my very young mom is currently in hospice with cancer. But I have never felt sad or scared for her. Maybe being a nurse helps me, but it doesn't protect me from lame euphemisms. This book was centering and grounding and adorable."
5," This book literally touched me. Literally. for real though, I loved reading it and it's definitely something I'll be re-reading soon because it's so intense and I don't think it's all sunk in yet. I highly recommend this to anyone and everyone who wants to cry and laugh and think."
5," There are no words strong enough to describe this book. There are no emotions strong enough to be felt when reading this book. I would call this book amazing but that would be an understatement. How can anyone not read this book?  Id have to say,  its the best book I've ever read"
5, Although some reviews say this is not about cancer don't take that literally...it definitely has details about cancer and how the teenagers suffer.  Good book but understand what it will be if you choose to read - not exactly the feelings I wanted to experience while on vacation.
5," This book made me laugh, made me cry and made me appreciate life. I loved every second of it and fell in love with Augustus Waters, just as Hazel fell in love with him. I finished the book in a total of about 3 hours. Definitely not a book that is easy to put down. It is AMAZING."
5," This was such an amazing story. The tears I cried throughout; good and bad. The love story - the heartache; such an emotional roller coaster, but in such an incredible way. I highly recommend this book to everyone; even though it will make them cry, its definitely worth the read."
2," This book came up as a you might also like selection and I certainly did! It was a quick and compelling read, very well written, with quirky characters; my favorite kind!  The emotional aspects of this book are touching and relatable for a person of any age. Highly recommended!"
5," The Fault in Our Stars was a great book. Although sad at times, it makes you grateful for the things you have in your own life. It also makes you laugh and cry. Overall, I would recommend this book to pretty much anyone... especially those who have dealt with loss in their lives."
5, knew going in to the book that I was going to cry. But I didn't know I would cry the way I did. The story and love story he created is something that makes you look at the world in a different way. It took me one sitting to finish this book. And I would read it all over again.
4," “Sometimes, you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book.”― John Green, The Fault in Our Stars^^^ yes. this."
5," When told It's a book about a girl with cancer you really don't want to read it. After finishing it, when recommending the book, you still can't say much but It's a book about a girl with cancer without giving anything away, but it truly was a wonderful book."
5," John Green did it again. TFIOS was an amazing whirlwind of laughs and tears, there was so much to love. The bittersweet story of two cancer kids who fall in love was made all the better by Green's unique humor. I would most definitely recommend it to readers of all ages! DFTBA"
5, This is a fantastic book.  John Green has a real gift for capturing the human condition and drawing out the depth of his characters.  I fear the movie will be a great disappointment as Shaileene Woodley (sp?) and that other guy from Divergent seem miscast.  Hopefully I'm wrong.
5, Why is it that adults often put down teen love as just a phase and somehow not real? All love is real. The pain is real. This book captures something few others have. Not since reading Deborah Hersh is a Liar have I found an author who is so genuine. This is a must read. Enjoy.
5," Get your tissues ready! Amazing story! Hazel and Gus are absolutely amazing and such an inspiration. Every man should strive to be like Gus! Every conversation between Hazel and her parents had me bawling, super touching story! The ending does have a twist and leave you crying."
5," have never written a review on a book before, and I'm a heavy reader. The Fault in our Stars is a work of perfection. Thought provoking and incredibly insightful. This book made me laugh out loud and cry. I have also never re-read a book before. This one will be an exception."
2," So I am not going to write a novel about how awesome this book is John Green already did that. :) But this is the best book I have read in many years, it is funny, happy, and sad what more do you want from a book. P.S. I couldn't put it down stayed up till about 4am reading it."
5,ve just finish The Fault in Our Stars and I've realized I've never been more moved by a novel then this one. There is a time of laughter but also sadness in this novel. It's extremely well written and I cannot stop raving about it please just do your self a favor and read it.
5," This book was absolutely beautiful. There are books that you enjoy, and there are books that just go deeper than you ever thought a book would go. I was bawling my eyes out uncontrollably, but it was worth it. This is a must read, and read slow so you can enjoy every last word."
5," absolutely adored this book! After reading it in the course of two nights, I loaned it to a friend, and to his sister as well. Everyone I've met has really loved it. It's so sad, what happens with Gus, and I felt myself tearing up. Four for you, John Green. You go John Green!"
5," The book arrived on time and was in very good condition! I've heard lots of good things about this book and I know that the author John Green has a very unique writing voice and can melt the heart of stone with his ability to create such raw, poetic, and very realistic stories."
5, got this story as a gift from my son. I kept putting off reading it because I thought I knew how it would affect me. I was wrong..it was worse. Beautifully written and very moving. I would recommend this to anyone and cannot wait to read something else written by John Green.
5," As a nurse this really spoke to me.Her struggle to be heard and understood and the sudden possibility of love is just heartbreaking.I've recommended this to everyone I know. Even patients, since this proves that if we listen we will hear.Loved it."
5," John Green beautifully displays that love does not discriminate based on the presence of illness or [insert complication here]. In reading this novel, it is clear that love does not disqualify and seeks to always defy the odds, even if the overcoming victory is but momentary."
5," Now, I'm not one for romance stories. However, I am glad I took the time to read this one. It is one of the best books I have read, with plenty of humor around every corner. The Fault in our Stars never gets boring, and even has a surprise twist. I highly recommend this book."
5," Clever language and cohesive thoughts in this young adult novella. It resonated with me on so many levels: as a parent, as a mortal, as one who has suffered loss, love, and longing for that which cannot be. I recommend it to everyone who has ever experienced those things....."
2," this book has been recommended to me by everyone. now I know why. it's truly an amazing book. I was caught up in the characters from Hazel to Augustus. their love was true and genuine. this book is a great read, a tear jerker, and a cute story about two kids who fell in love."
5," For insight into what a seriously or chronically ill person feels, thinks and needs read this book.  If nothing else, it can serve as a guide for things to say to a friend or relatively faced with cancer or some such disease.  At times it is heartbreaking, at times inspiring."
5," loved this book.  The author's style of writing had me emotionally invested by the end of the first chapter.  Advice to future readers: you will need a box of tissue nearby for the sad parts, but the humor makes up for that.  This one is definitely on my favorites list now."
5," thought The Fault in Our Stars was terrific and well written. I believe Hazel and Augustus were both realistic and heroic. The Fault in Our Stars will make you feel a turmoil of emotions while not becoming too lengthy lengthy or boring. Well done John Green, very well done."
5, Great story with very real characters. Loved the writing. I zoomed through the book and felt like I knew Hazel and Augustus. I think my Middle school daughter and High school son would both enjoy this book as much as I did. Needed tissues towards the end--- bittersweet tears.
5," What I loved the most about this book was John Green's unique take on two teenagers meeting and dealing with  having cancer. However, cancer is not the focus. It's their relationship, their acceptance of each other, and their dealing with living life. I could not put it down."
5," When I chose this book, I didn't look closely and thought it was a memoir (my usual choice) but the farther I got into it the more interested I became. I read it bit by bit finding myself eager to get to the next part. It was well written and I would definitely recommend it."
5," This book is well written, this is always important to me. I couldn't put it down and finished it one evening and was so depressed I couldn't get to sleep. These teen agers were drawn wonderfully and each story had you rooting for them, but it just wasn't going to be enough."
5, And read this. You are seriously missing out. The way John Green writes grief makes Nicholas Sparks look like Stephenie Meyer.  It's heartbreaking and funny and is one of those stories that will stick with you and make it hard to start another book after you finish this one.
5," would recommend this book to anyone who has faced hardships and knows what love feels like. Basically, anyone with a heart. This is a must-read that changed the way I look at life and how happy I am to have mine. The Stars were certainly aligned in the making of this book."
2, thought the book was so well written and that not only will teens enjoy the book  a woman of forty can too. I recommend the book for people that love a fast read! I read it in four hours. I feel in love with the main characters in this book and can appreciate the ending :)
5," picked this book up because I read in the newspaper a few months ago that this was a good read. I am absolutely not disappointed in the story or the message it sends. If you have some time on your hands, please give this book a read. I promise you will not be disappointed."
5," Great book for both parents and teens.  I like how it didn't take the subject of cancer and just make it this dark book you had to endure.  There were moments of sweetness, humor, and horror.  But they were all mixed together. . .like real life.  Just have the tissues ready!"
5," absolutely loved this book. It is what its says on the cover, You laugh, you cry and then you come back for more!! Hands down John Green.  I can't remember reading a book that has made me laugh to myself like an idiot and then pull out a tissue to wipe my tears! Love it!"
4," After reading Cormac McCarthy's The Road I wanted an easier and lighter follow-up.  I devoured this in one cross country flight and although the subject matter is bleak, I found it beautifully written and very warm.  I absolutely recommend for anyone young or old!"
5," cried after reading this book.  I don't think it was from sadness, although loss is prevalent in this novel.  I think it was from reconciliation and hope. I truly fell in love with The Fault in our Stars.  It's one of my top 10 favorite books. Well-written and meaningful."
5," This book was not just outstanding, but out of this world. It made me cry and smile at the same time. John Green, you are now my favorite author. I love your writing, it is emotionally beautiful. I hope to read more of your books, such as;Looking for Alaska and Paper towns."
5, take away something new every time I read this book. The author is brilliant and his characters are believable and yet fantastic. I cry with them and laugh with them every step of the way. It is a cancer book but first it is a love story and that makes all the difference.
5,t is an awesome book i love action books and this was action and romance smashed into one. Normally i hate romance novels but i loved this one. I would one hundred percent recommend it and one hundred percent read it more than one time because you notice different things.
5, THIS BOOK WAS VERY HARD TO PUT DOWN. THE CHARACTERS WERE ALL AWESOME IN THEIR OWN WAY. THE AUTHOR PULLED YOU RIGHT IN LIKE YOU WERE RIGHT THERE WITH THE CHARACTERS. I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO YOUNG AND OLD. BELIEVE ME THIS BOOK WILL BE ONE OF YOUR FAVORITES. ENJOY THE STORY.
2, don't have to review the plot (it's been done).I don't have to tell you the characters are well developed (it's been done).I don't even have to tell you to have Kleenex near by (it's been done).I just wanted to give it 5 stars. The comic relief is much appreciated.
5, Recommend to teens and parent of teens. Gives great insight into character of teens and their need for independence in the face of life. Shows the great tenacity teens have to hang on to what life offers up and the great ability adults have to support but also disappoint.
5, The Fault in Our Stars was utterly astonishing. I could not put it down! This book was beautifully written and carries such a great story that will have me talking about it for months. John Green has really outdid himself with this one. Now it's time To  go see the movie!
4," The first half of the book is captivating. The author's way of describing death and suffering from a raw, teenage perspective is entertaining. However I became bored of the romance and the trips abroad. It all seemed overdone and fake. 17 year old kids don't act this way."
5," the book was recommended to me by a couple different friends with varying tastes who all loved it, so I figured it was worth a read.  I couldn't put the book down and found the writing to be engaging, witty and unique while the story was touching and impressively crafted."
3, read this for book club and I finished it within days (I'm  slow reader so days is good for me)!  So beautiful and touching!  I didn't want to put it down!  I love the characters!! I can't wait for the movie--thought I'm not too satisfied with the actors they've chosen.
5, My first read on my new kindle couldn't have been better.  I picked it because so many gave it five stars and because there wasn't profanity.  The characters were so real.  I loved Hazel's dad.  Couldn't wait to get home each night so I could read it. Highly recommend it.
5," Fault in Our Stars is an interesting and touching story.  One of those books that's difficult  to put down.  John Green's thoughts are deep, clever, and well expressed as the story revolves around life, death, and love. Teenagers dying of cancer. You may shed a few tears."
5, This book made me want to cry. I have had many books be somewhat thoughtful  of life and do the same thing but this connected me to what went through her mind. I could never tell what would happen and it had s th cities in stories in stories. I love it you should read it
5," Didn't know it was a YA book till I started reading. An entertaining story. Excellent medium for teaching kids empathy and awareness about cancer or other life threatening illnesses. Language and storyline a bit far-fetched, but that's perhaps par for the course for acYA"
2," To my hold my attention to say the least is maybe an hour at a time and usually reading it puts me to sleep. However this book The Fault in Our Stars was refreshingly funny, honest and relatable. I am not even sure to this day why I purchased it but I am glad that I did."
4," was slightly worried at 1st that this would be too sad or depressing of a book, but it was not in any way. It was a touching, &amp; moving read. The characters were so great, that you forget they're not real people. I would absolutely recommend it to any one of my friends."
5, This book is very well written.  It is sad but sweet.  You do not have to be a teenager to enjoy this book.  The characters are so interesting.  My heart just broke for the parents.  I couldn't imagine what they were going through.  I would recommend this book to anyone!
5, This book is amazaynIt will make you laughIt will make you cryAnd it will do what all great books do.See the world from another perspective.This is sutible for all ages.Everyone will enjoy it.Another amazayn book from John Green.
5," don't write long, plot summarizing reviews as there are plenty doing that already.  My opinion on this book:  Painfully sad, but also funny and romantic. I absolutly loved it and it made me so thankful for the healthy kids in my life (to quote the St. Jude commercial)."
5," This book was one of those books where you can't put it down. I read through it like a storm. I would recommend this to teens and up because of mild language. This books story though is truly unique, the way the author wrote and used diction was nothing short of amazing."
5, hate to think of young adults reading such a mixed up confused writing  a depiction of life as hopeless and futile.  If this is truly the way that young people view life then we don't have much of a future.  I know this is fiction but oh my the mind that thinks those thoughts.
5, chose to read this book because I was hearing great reviews on the film version. I told myself Maybe I should read this book and then watch the movie whenever I finish the book.  I finished the book 24 hours I bought it! I'm rushing to the theatre right now!
1, This book was very well written and very true in regards to cancer and death. The love story between hazel and Augustus is so bittersweet and real. I felt emotionally involved with this story and the characters. I finished this book in one day and thoroughly enjoyed it.
5," finally got to read this book, and I had to make my sister and then my brother and then my friend read it. I cried, I laughed, I sobbed quietly in the middle of the night in order not to wake anyone.Hazel's dad made me cry over and over. Hazel's dad is the best."
2,"m so sad that the book ended. I love the romance behind it and love the book is not about some princess type girl that is to good for anybody, but about a simply girl that has real life problems. LOVE it!!!! One of the BEST books i have ever read. Thank you John Green"
5," can not believe that this is a young adult book. my granddaughter 13 years old recommended it, we are in a book club of two.  It was written with such sensitivity and understanding of the characters. I was completely absorbed and could not put it down, very emotional."
5," fell in love with the story when I read the first page. It features a great storyline, one that you rarely see in any book. Hazel is by far the most heroic female I have ever got the privilege to read about. Funny and charming, this book makes me see through new eyes."
5," don't usually read books about cancer because it's obvious what's going to happen in the end, but this book...... I'm speechless. This book had me laughing and crying. It's so beautifully written that it has become one of my favorite novels. This is a true love story."
5," This book was a lovely read. I read it all the way home on a flight from California to Chicago and it was fantastic. I loved the main character and every single other character in this book. It's a quick read, but will leave a huge impression on you! Good for the soul!"
5," Chose this book, because my 14 yr old/all her friends were reading it. Wanted to see what all the hype was about. Also to make sure it was appropriate. When I heard there would be a movie, I got reading. Like to read the book first. Was not disappointed. Cried/laughed."
5,"m so glad I read this book. I cried like a baby.  I knew from the first page that I would, but I chose to read it anyway. the only reason I didn't give it five stars is because of moral content. No spoilers, just didn't agree with the necessity of a couple of events."
5, You will do all three and more while reading this uplifting and tragic story. I hestitated to read this novel because the premise sounded like such a downer. Was I ever wrong. I laughed more while reading this book than others advertised as comedy. Don't miss this one!
4,ve rarely met a book I could so easily identify with. The characters in this book leapt off the page for me. It is a book I will read over again. This is not just for young adults and teens - it is for everyone but it is especially for anyone who has struggled alone.
5, Thought provoking story about a love that transcends the human existence.  You will weep with two unforgettable characters.  If you love another;read it.  If you have lost that love to illness; read it. Take the many spirit building observations and heal then move on.
2," This was such an amazingly sad and inspirational story. I loved every single thing about it. It made you feel every emotion you are supposed to feel from a book. Love, family, heartbreak, inspiration, death, sadness, heart wrenching, dream fulfilling. Just loved it!!!"
5," This book heavily deals with cancer so it hit close to home, but this book is amazing at questioning life in any way a person can.  I think reading this book could make you a better person if only by making you want to enjoy life more for the people who no longer can."
5," While this book was intended for a young adult audience, I felt that it is an outstanding book for all audiences.  The characters are all teens but the message could apply to anyone.  First book that I have read by this author but I will be reading other books by him."
5," read this book in one sitting and I think I have to read it again! The characters were all quirky and had hillarious conversations! The romance was belivable and heart warming and finally this novel will make you laugh, cry, smile, and love it from beginning to end!"
5," Nothing I say or write will give this book any justice, the meaning and story is absolutely perfect in the most broken and imperfect way. If you don't laugh so hard and cry the next second, you don't deserve the eyes you have to read, might as well give them to Isaac."
5," have seen this movie on 6.7.14 and it was the best movie I have ever seen. However, they have to provide you with a box of tissues when allowing you to purchase tickets for this movie. I have not read the book but I would definitely recommend the movie. Loved it..."
5, Ch. 21. The first sentence brought me to tears! This book is well composed and it has a unique way of telling the story. It is a fantastic love story and requires a certain understanding of the situation! The Fault in Our Stars is well worth your time and dedication!
5," Beautifully written love story. Recommended to me by my grandson. I hesitated because it was recommended for teenage readers or young adults; however, I found it to be a page turner or in my case a Kindle clicker. Would highly recommend this book--even to us seniors."
5," read this book because a friend told me how great it was.  I couldn't agree more.  I read it in two days, which is not like me as I easily get distracted.  But I Loved it.  I am very excited now to see how they do the movie.  I am hoping they stay true to the book."
5," Words cannot describe how good this book is. It took me on a roller coaster of emotions, and I never knew what to expect. This book meant so much to me, I've read the ending about 6 times. I've never gotten this crazy about a book. I'd recommend this book to everyone"
2," Where to begin? This book was amazing. Starting out with Hazel a young girl struggling through illness and lonliness, then she meets a boy named Augustus Waters who in turn changes her life with a horribly tragic plot twist bringing sadness until the end of the book."
5," Dont get me wrong the story, the characters, the  settings ...everything is perfect in this book! But i couldnt finish it .,. Actually couldnt handle the vivid pain thru words.... the author actually made me cry throughout the book.... it was jusst too sad for me...."
5," Beautiful love story despite the ugly specter of cancer and death in young adults.  Well written and poignant, but left me crying for the loss of one of the main characters.  The courage of anyone who is dealing with cancer is to be admired.  What a terrible disease."
5," So well written, you fall instantly in love with all the characters and John Greens writing is so raw that any loss would feel as though you had just lost a family member. The world he creates in this book is just so real. He just earned himself a tried and true fan."
5," have never felt so emotionally attached to both the protagonists. I cried a lot. But I loved how you can really build a relationship with the characters as if they were real. But they are real, in our hearts. I look forward to being a part of John Green 's fan base"
5,"m not one for liking to read but I fell in Love with this book! It's a must read! This beautiful story made me laugh, cry, mad at times even! I hope to fall in love with some one the way they did and I hope I can love the way the way Augustus loved hazel  one day!"
5, Absolutely amazing!!!!! Beautifully written!!! You begin to love the characters from the beginning and can't help but cheer them on throughout the book. It's a wonderful read that will make you cry and laugh all at the same time. I recommend everyone should read it.
5," This is about the most moving story I have ever read.  I was attached to the 3 main characters as though I knew them.  The feeling within this story is amazing.  I must admit I was moved to tears, a lot of tears.  I want to see the movie, but not in a theater alone."
5," This book is about the human spirit.  John Green gives us these wonderful characters, all of whom you come to love and wish you could be more like.  He treats an unimaginably sad subject with such grace and integrity.  This book is sad, but it is also inspirational."
5," read this in one sitting. I couldn't take my hands off of it. I love it because it's not the classic love story. It's realistic, it has everything you want in a book. There is comedy, love, faults, twist and turns. John Green sure knows how to twist your emotions."
2, This is one of the best books I have ever read. John Green writes like he actually a teenage girl. The story is touching and was one of the only books that ever made me cry. This book is amazing for literally anyone that likes reading. You should read this book now.
5," John Green has written a beautifully tragic novel for teens with The Fault in Our Stars. I won't give away too much, but it has to be the saddest, happiest, thought provoking teen novel that I could've read recently. I suggest it for young and older alike."
5," John Green has truly outdone himself this time. I laughed, I cried~ This book - living in it's own kind of infinity - has indisputably stolen a much larger piece of infinity in not only my heart, but the hearts of countless others. I can not wait to read it again···"
5," This is not a book for everyone, because it is a sad book in many ways (I mean, the main characters have cancer). But I wish everyone would give it a try, it is sweet and sad, and maybe not totally believable, but it is also that kind of book that touches your soul."
5," Well a friend of mine suggested it to me, awhile back and I'm just finished it. The way the story is written ties you into the life of Hazel. You're sad when she has a down day and you're happy when she is. She becomes part of your life. I really enjoyed this novel."
5," thought this book showed the true meaning of love. This book also helps people have a better understanding of what people ,and their families, with cancer are going through. I think John Green did an excellent job with this book. This is my favorite book of his."
5," This is by far the best book ive ever read. it's weird how these non existing characters make it feel so true and real. I dont know to how describe it, but its very romantic and DEFINITELY a 5 star book! check it out!! ive recommended this book to 4 of my friends."
5," At the beginning I thought a book from the point of view of a 16 year old wouldn't keep my interest, but I could barely put it down. I literally laughed out loud at some very witty one-liners and then bawled through the end. A very emotive book, very well written."
5," No spoilers - I don't believe in them.Just know that if you buy and read this book you WILL NOT be disappointed.This is an amazing story well told.  It's honest, brutal, loving and hopeful.I can't wait to read the rest of Mr. Green's works."
5," My daughter recommended this and I didn't get to it right away, but once I started it, I spent an entire day reading and didn't go to bed until I was done. I can't explain more except to say that it is sad and beautiful and deeply moving in a way I never expected."
2, This is greatly detailed and its a wonderful book for teens. It made me under stand more about cancer and love. I would highly recommend this book to my friends(: I cried so hard when Augustus died it's amazeballs and awesomesauce and I will definitely reread it(:
5, found this novel to be a candid account of the effects of a disease none of our children should endure. The characters were beautifully drawn out and engaging. I've recommended this novel to a councilor friend of mine because I think she too could learn from it.
5," This book is perfect for people who like a little romance,a little sorrow and a whole lot of adventure,love,and laughter. This is by far one of the best books I have ever read.It tells the strange love story of two teen cancer kids who happen to fall in love.Okay"
5, This novel is touching in a way that reminds readers to tread lightly on the hearts of others. I appreciate the way this author tells a story of adolescent tragedy in a way that entices a mature reader. Great conversation between characters that is great to read.
5," This book was a beautiful story of a young girl and accepting her life struggles and living life to the fullest extent. The love story that ensues is the kind of love you pray for. I highly recommend this book, make sure you have the tissues handy for a good cry!"
5," This novel shares the life of two young cancer survivors making their mark on the world. Young love touches their lives, embracing love shared and loved hoped for. The author reaches the readers' emotions with beautiful analogies and insight. This is a must read."
5, don't have any other word more Then WOW... I  have never read a book before that has made me burst out in tears. this author gets you really attached to the characters and makes you feel what they are feeling. can't wait till the movie comes out this summer! :)
4," Let me just say this: I have never before cried during a book or movie. Ever. I have never been so touched. And trust me, I'm quite the bookworm. I am thirteen years old and definetly not the emotional type. This book will stay in my heart forever and ever. Okay."
5," just wanted a lighthearted love story and what do I get?This almost pathetically deep story of two people who happen to be teenagers who discover life through a looking glass of the most beautiful kind.As tumblr would say, I can't even"
5," Wonderfully written book and John Green is a very talented author... When I got to the end, I thought that maybe, just maybe if I turned the page there would be more. Makes you really question some of the most mundane and commonly accepted practices in our world."
2," will keep it short and simple: I had high expectations having read all of John Green's other books, but were easily exceeded. Everything was fantastic and it was better than I ever could have imagined. With TFiOS, John Green has surely left his mark.DFTBA :)"
5," hate reading. Don't even read magazines. But, upon the request of my sister, I decided to read this book. I was amazed by how the author grabbed you and you couldn't break loose. Finished the book in one afternoon. Wonderful book that I'm sure I'll read again."
5, This is one of the best books I have every read and I read over billion books a year. I have never been the type to cry and this book made me cry for hours. John Green is a genius and I I'm so happy he made this book. Thank you John for this AMAZING creation! :)
5," This book is amazing. It speaks with such honesty that some people don't have half a mind to tell. Sad ending, but I think without the ending it had it wouldn't be so... truthful. I sure hope you loved this book as much as I did. I will surely cherish this book."
5, The fault in our stars. A profound story that is both far away from me and deeply close. Rendering me with a feeling that is simultaneously horrible and partly wonderful. A must read. I feel as if I just suffered heartache in the hands of a paperback (on kindle)
5," This was a beautiful, well-written book. It touches your heart for the obvious reason- two young lovers with cancer- but there is a refreshing perspective that lets you bond with the characters not only out of sympathy but also out of admiration for their grace."
5," My daughter insisted I read this so I already knew it would be wonderful--however,  I did not anticipate this little gem of a book would be THAT good.  It caught me off guard.Fresh, snappy dialogue, compelling characters and true love.  Just read the book!"
5, As I read this I found it horribly morbid and inane. The writer constantly attempts to use psychological theories like the hierarchy of needs without actually understanding what they mean...I would not recommend this book to anyone as it is dribble.
5, This book is the first I've read in a long time. It was recommended by my daughter. I loved it! Very thought provoking - which would make it an excellent choice fora book club. The characters were believable and it had a good plot. Excellent for preteens on up!
5," found The Fault in Our Stars to be a wonderfully, well-written story.  Green is able to make you feel emotions so deep that you feel as if you're in the book yourself. I highly recommend this to people of all ages, as it has the ability to appeal to everyone."
2,"t is one thing to read a cannot-put-it-down sort of book, but its rare that such a book can linger in your thoughts for weeks after finishing it. This book continues to visit my thoughts and that, I believe, is a measure of its power. Just wonderful."
5, This is definitely one of the more inspiring books I have read in my life. It's 'a cancer book without being a book about cancer'. I think this novel is worth reading no matter your age or gender. It is sure to be a classic and well remembered in years to come.
5," The characters in the book are wonderfully written. The story has some plot points that are questionable when it comes to real-life possibilities. However, I very much enjoyed this book. I laughed and cried. You won't be sorry if you read this book.DFTBA."
5,"t was great to be able to read a story where I knew where a lot of the things in the book where.  The author lives in Indianapolis. Loved his writing. Loved and Hated this book at the same time. If you want a book that will bring you to tears, this is the one."
5, An insightful look into the minds of two young friends &amp; lovers on their ultimately tragic journey. I laughed &amp; cried but couldnt but help feeling overriding value of living as full a life as we possibly can. This book is originally written. My advice? Read it!
5," There are no words to explain how much this book has moved me, or to explain how much of a true privilege it has been to be able to know and fall in love with Hazel Grace and Augustus.Ending this book on a very emotional note.A++++, Mr. Green."
5," The book was amazing and it got me addicted to John Green. I love his work. the book was the appropriate amount of comedy and realistic moments. And I cried for the last like ten chapters, but in a good way. It shows how connected to the characters you can get."
5, This is one of the best books I've ever read. I couldn't put it down! It was one of the few books that made me cry. This book was extremely relatable in the sense that John Green wrote the story in a way that Hazel would have told it. Everything was so spot on.
5, This book is the best book I've ever read. At times I would just completely zone out because I was so into it. It even made me tear up quite a few times. This is definitely a five star worthy book without a doubt. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone.
5," thought it was gonna talk about stars and their formation and all that crap. But it was really unexpexted. It had me up at night till late until i was finiah with it. A real page turner. It will make you laugh,cry, upset and happy. Really extremly good book."
2," A wonderful, realistic portrayal of teens caught in disease and death, without sugary sentimentality.  The  characters rang true; having known thousands of teens in my career,  that's what often grates on me in many otherwise great novels.  This was wonderful."
5, This book was one of the best books I have read in a long time. There are many times not he book where I laughed but also cried this book is worth buying it. Unless you have no heart to will cry I promise. This book was amazing I would recommend it to any one.
5, really enjoyed this book! Although there is the tragedy of loss there is also this side of comedy that's kind of up lifting. I didn't find myself crying like would have expected but felt the loss in a different way. A nice light read given the subject matter
5," liked this book a lot although it is sad.  As a person who works in healthcare, it provides some insight into what knowing you are going to die might be like.  Best wishes to hazel and Augustus, even though they aren't real - someone with a similar fate, is."
5," Time Magazine called The Fault in Our Stars Damn near genius.They were almost correct, the book is pure genius. This book has so much emotion and is so well written that I honestly cannot recommend it enough. All I can say is that you need to read this book."
5, No matter what age you are this book will touch your heart. (Or at least make you sob uncontrollably for no less than an hour). John Green does an incredible job at describing the human condition in a way that will change how you see the world.  Just amazing.
5," heard a lot about this book before I decided to read it. I haven't read a book that wasn't school required in 5 years. Needless to say, I've gained my love for reading back. This book made me more emotionally attached than any other. Definitely a must read."
5," This is an incredibly well written story. It also speaks to the power of truth in all things. The humor, sensitivity, truthand love between these two people is inspiring. It is difficult to know how to face ones death. This author managesto do it."
5," laughed so much while reading this book and I cried so much while reading this book. Engaging in a somewhat invasive manner. Admirable, genuine, and charismatic characters that win even while they lose because of their terrible and wonderful circumstances."
5," This book was amazing! I received it earlier than expected and finished it the day it arrived.I can't wait to get Paper Towns, Looking for Alaska, and An Abundance of Katherines next.John Green is a magnificent author and will go down in history."
2," got the Kindle version; there are very few typos, and they don't detract from the reading experience.Overall, it's a very good book. I'm not good at reviewing books, but I can say that, after a few chapters in, it was hard to put the book down."
5," Really worth the read, it'll make you laugh while you're crying -- welcome to Green's world! Quite the eye-opener, it's quite heartbreaking, but ut would kill me to know you haven't read this beauty. I suggest buying four copies and bringing them everywhere!"
5," Well done! I would not normally see myself reading a book about teenagers with cancer, as I don't have this going on in my family or friends, and I am 63 years old, but the book was so good I could not stop reading it- crying and laughing- it was heart-felt."
5," read this book twice already, and I still can't get over how great it is. John green is an amazing writer and I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys John Green. Anyone who hasn't read any of his books should still read this, it's truly wonderful."
5, purchased this book for my daughter who is a John Green fan - it was signed since I bought it in presale (a promotion at the time)  I am very pleased with the purchase and my daughter loved the book - it is now a part of her complete John Green Collection.
5," cried the ugly cry. I knew I would. I said I wouldn't read the book because I just knew the ugly cry would win. It did. And I am changed. Forever changed. And I am thankful for ugly cries. Without ugly cries, what would the real purpose of life be anyway?"
5, saw a preview for the movie and wanted to read the book before the movie came out.  The book was slow and the ending unexpected/not good.  I didn't really enjoy reading this--I really had to push through it because I have a hard time not finishing a book.
5," This was an amazing book. It was nothing like I expected. Definitely a book I will recommend to others! If you are an emotional person, this book will get you. I am not very emotional when it comes to books and movies but I cried a ton in this amazing book."
3," don't know what to say. I don't think I can put in to words how I feel. A beautiful love story, I don't think I ever cried so hard reading a book before. I read it in one setting. I couldn't put it down. I had to find out what happened with Gus and Hazel."
5, Going from laughing to crying because of honesty is the constant power in this story. It's truth and raw sense of humor speak volumes and shows the author has faith in his reader. I am so happy to have read this book and cannot wait to share it with others.
2," This is the most beautiful book I've ever read, to be completely honest. And at the end of it, I feel as if a piece of me is gone, only to be returned the next time I fall in love with Augustus Waters and Hazel Grace Lancaster. My heart hurts in a good way."
5," Really deserves 5 stars. Reading about cancer is sad but this book turns it into a celebration of life and how we choose to live. I wish I knew Hazel and Augustus, but they're far too interesting for me. Loved this book in all its sadness and life and love."
5," would personally rank this book as number one on my list of favorite books.  Within the first five pages, this book made me laugh out loud and by the end it had me so deeply attached to the characters that it had me crying.  This was such an amazing book!"
5, This is a book that makes you think about such lofty issues as oblivion and the impact your life and love has on the world. It is a beautiful story that plumes the deepest emotions of loss and love in a situation that involves the young and teaches the old.
5," By far one of the best books I have ever read. I don't think anyone can not like this book, it's just not possible. It'll have you crying, laughing, and it really does open your eyes to everything we take for granted. Read this book and you won't forget it."
5," Amazingly well written love story. The story of Hazel and Gus was so touching. You wouldn't think a novel about two kids with cancer could be so good, but John Green developed such strong characters that I was crying as if I knew them personally by the end."
5," Not my thing, didn't finish it. I didn't appreciate the whole everyone is going to die nobody will remember you, eventually humanity will disappear. Seemed to be secular and mocking faith....but rather than mucking through it I just got a refund."
5,t hits you so hard. It's intelligent and sorrowful. You get to know the characters as if they were real people in your life. I would recommend this beautiful tragedy to anyone and everyone even those who don't read often. This book is definitely worth it.
2," wonderful story of young adults struggling with cancer, their life, loves and feelings about being the big C patient. Thought provoking and moving text. Looking at a families struggles with a sick child. View of death from the patients point of view."
5,t's a short simple novel that puts huge holes in your heart. While it may not be a literary masterpiece it made me burst into tears more than once.  For the first time it made me truly understand childhood illness and the endless suffering impacted by it.
2, Right off the bat Green proves to you this isn't your typical star crossed love story. This is a thought provoking refreshing novel that keeps you turning the pages even after the book is finished. The style of writing is phenomenal. I highly recommend it.
5," am such a huge fan of John, this was the first book I read of his and haven't been able to put him down yet! I loved this book and how it is so relatable and the humor in it is awesome! I've re-read tfios a couple times now and I'm still in love with it."
5," When you read the description of this book, you think that its going to be sad and depressing - which it is, but at the same time, it's so great.  I loved the characters and the relationships they had with eachother, and it made you really appreciate life."
5, This might just be  my new favorite book. I laughed. I cried. I got angry. I fell in love. This book was beautiful and really made you FEEL. John Green is a fantastic writer and I would recommend this book to anyone. There is one con to this book: it ends.
5,"t made me laugh, cry, and even everything in between. It did easily the best book I've read in the past year. Being a 16 year old, I recommend it to anyone near my age and I think adults would love it as well. It is so universal that anyone could like it."
5," just finished this book and am grieving.  What can I say but, amazing...horrifying...uplifting...heart breaking...magical.  I'll dream about Hazel Grace and Augustus tonight, and probably for many nights to come.  My advice to all of you; READ.THIS.BOOK!"
5," John Green did it again. This book will make you laugh, it'll make you cry and it'll make you think long and hard about the relationships you have. Whether you're a nerdfighter or new to John Green, make sure you pick up this book and give it a read. DFTBA"
5," This book shows us the readers that life isn't all ways great. Not all of us are healthy and for the ones who are, they're lucky. The Fault In Our Stars is showing us no matter what problems we are facing we can live someone as much as Augustus and Hazel."
5,t was a great book with lots of life lessons and it did keep my hooked to the point where I finished this book in 2 days because I couldn't put it down. My only complaint is that teenagers don't talk that way in real life! Some of it was very far fetched
5," Like many YA selections, The Fault in Our Stars has an enduring message that transcends adolescence.  It reminds readers not only of the fragility of life, but also of our innate potential to change the lives and hearts of those around us.-F. Nelson"
2, Hands down the best book I have ever read! It kept me interested and wanting more the whole time. I read this in a little under 24 hours because I could not put it down. It doesn't go the way you want at times but I loved it nonetheless! HIGHLY recommend.
5," No review necessary. Just read it and weep.Easily one of the bet books out there. No matter age or gender, this book means something. Something beatiful. Something ou never get tired of seeing. I hop you love it. because I do.I do."
5, had no idea what this book was about but I bought it because it was a  New York Times best seller... I cried too many times but kept reading. It was very touching. I wouldn't recommend reading this  at work (because of the crying) but it's a great read.
5,"t's been awhile since I've read a book like this, but I am so glad I did. John Green's ability to invoke such real emotions from the most believable characters is astounding. I cried, I laughed, I learned; I had an experience. This story is unbelievable."
4," John has such a way with words, he can make you feel hopeful and utterly hopeless all at once.  This story is no exception.  The story of Hazel and Augustus will make you question everything you ever believed. Maybe not question, but certainly reevaluate."
5, recently read a book by the parents of a thirteen year old girl who died of cancer and there is almost nothing of her own thoughts in the book except I want to leave my mark. This book is the interior life she surely had as she faced oblvion.
5," This book (although I don't read a lot other than my school text books these days) changed me. I feel so deeply for the characters and then the author. I couldn't put the book down, nor did I want to. Great easy read. I recommend to readers of all sorts."
5," cannot read another book although I tried shortly after finishing this one. I felt as though I have not properly mourned the characters, have not given them the time to seep in and give them my due respect. In case you can't tell...this book got to me."
5," laughed, I cried, and fell completely in love with Hazel, Augustus, Isaac, even old Peter Van Houten. Not only is this beautifully written but just one of the most stunning, yet heart wrenching love stories. Excellent book. Hats off to you, John Green."
5," A wonderful story but I do feel readers should be very aware how emotional this story is. Some of the conversations between the characters showed maturity far beyond their years, but there again they had been forced into adulthood by their circumstances."
2, will say that I'm the person who doesn't cry when reading a book.... or at least until I read this book. I was sobbing while reading this on a plane ride. I've read books that have depressing or sad moments but none that have made me cry. I loved it.
5," just finished this book and I have to say it is absolutely wonderful. The attachment that I built to these characters was heartwarming and at times Heartbreaking. Seriously, if your debating buying this book debate no further, its a must read for sure."
5, beautifully written but so emotional I almost couldn't finish it. Great read. I found myself at times reflecting on my own views of life and death which I haven't really ever dove into. Hazel and Augustus put a very true spin on what should be precious.
5," This book is my bible it is the first book to make me cry I highly recommend you to read this book because your not going to just sit there and read words you are going imagine it and feel the emotions from the characters as you go so read it ,like now!"
5, This book was very touching and hit home. Hazel is such a strong woman in this book. Shes definitely an inspiration. John Green done such an amazing job!I'll definitely be reading more of his books. I think I'm going to buy Looking For Alaska right now!
5, This book is a timeless classic. Bought it in kindle form now ordering it in paperback so it can stay on my bookshelf forever and ever. It's wisdom is infinite and really puts life in perspective with a smile on your face and tears in your eyes. LOVE :)
5,"t holds truths in this world that many of us lack, it is a simple book. This type of writing is what guides us to understand ourselves and the world around us. With tragedy, conflict and comic relief I loved The Fault in Our Stars from start to finish."
5," saw the movie preview, it looks pretty good. The book is amazing.  A little hard to read through tears, but expected. My husband just sits their and laughs at me. I have not finished but won't take long. It is a pretty fast read and not a bit boring."
5, Good awesome I loves this book and hope you will to its sad funny and outstanding I would recommend this book to people who enjoy realistic romance because that's what this book is. Please read it and if you liked it go see the movie coming out in June
5, An excellent cast of characters and beautiful emotion.  Enthralling and truly magical.  I would read and re-read this book a hundred times again.  The emotion and connection you have with the characters while reading is touching and real.  A must read.
2," The book the fault in our stars is the most brilliant piece of literature I have ever read. I love Augustus Waters more than anyone else. As a girl with a disease, I felt so connected to these characters. I have never cried more in a book. Thank you."
5," Having read most John Green books, I can say that this by far is my favorite. This isn't some predictable, typical teen book; it's quirky and whimsical and you  will become overly attached to the characters and plot. It's, dare I say, close to perfect."
5,"t hasn't even been 24 hours since I've started this phenomenal read. John Green constructed an amazing piece of art that ill carry with me forever. I feel like Hazel right now, wondering what happens of the characters. Thank you John Green. Thank you."
5," chose this book because I had never read anything like it before and I don't think I ever will. What made me like it so much is that it was detailed very well, every page made me feel like I was there with them. I would strongly recommend to any one."
5, This book is so awesome I can't even tell you. I just love it and I think it shows you that life is something uncontrollable but that we can choose how to welcome it. We can either spend it like van Houten or like Hazel and Augustus. Ans I choose H &amp; G
5, This is such a lovely story. I am not a fan of death books but this one is very different. There is so much real love and kindness in it.I would recommend it to people who like to cry about a book but love to be inspired by hope in the same book.
5," What a wonderful book. I couldn't put it down. I fell in love with each of the characters.  Though it made me cry, I was captivated by so many lines about life. I found myself highlighting those lines throughout the book. A definite read for everyone."
5," highly recommend this book to young adults to adults. It is a truly amazing love/drama filled with suspense and beauty. This book mad me cry, laugh, and cry more. No words can describe this book's elegance. All I can say is that it is a must read!!!"
5," got this book because of the outstanding reviews. Upon reading it, one sitting, I had to agree. The characters are strong and vibrant. Yes, it is true, the book had me laughing and crying, sometimes at the same time.  Well worth your time and money."
5," Beautiful and poetic, thoughtful and intense, this book is well worth the read. It takes a new look at cancer and the meaning of life, and lays it before the reader effortlessly and perfectly. I reread the last chapter just so it wouldn't have to end."
2," This book was fantastic and the first John Green book I read. Trust me, I don't get teary at any form of media. There have been maybe three in my life. And I teared up both times I've read this. Sincerely, one of the few books I recommend to everyone."
5, Can't say the book is good as the topic is far from good....but a great read and I would highly recommend it.  The story itself would be good for anyone to experience but some of the words used might be above an average teenagers vocabulary.
5," love this book so much, I only got it last night and started reading it this morning, I'm not finished, I'm only on chapter 8 but it's so good that I just walk down the stairs with my eyes on the book, it's so good, Hazel and Gus are just something"
5," Although the subject matter is a bit morose, I think the overall theme in the book is very good.  Once I started, I wasn't able to put it down.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for good quick read with a lot of heart and emotion."
5," At first, I did not know what to think of this book. My original opinion based on the first 50 pages or so was eh. In fact, when I described what I had read so far to a co-worker (whose teenage daughter raved about this book) she said, Sounds cheesy. And to be completely honest, she was right. But I kept reading anyway, and ignored the temptation to give up on the book and watch the movie instead.Now that I've finished the book, I can say with all sorts of authority that I do not have that The Fault In Our Stars is one of those books that gets better after you read it. Don't give up on the book.With that being said, do I think this book is worth the hype it gets? Nope. Not at all. I still think it's overrated. Horribly overrated, actually. As far as books in this genre go, I still say that Wendy Wunder's The Probability of Miracles (read the review here) trumps The Fault in Our Stars. If this were a cage match, Wunder's book would be taking home the gold belt in the categories of readability, witty banter between characters, and swoon worthiness.So what made me drop TFIOS down a few notches? Frankly, the wordiness. I like that Gus and Hazel bonded over a book. For a reader, that's a win. Unfortunately, there were many book quotes and long excerpts in the TFIOS that could have been cut without ever affecting the plot. I found myself skimming through those parts because they just felt too heavy and borderline pretentious. I'm even going to go out on a limb and say the younger teenage readers that are fangirling over this book didn't even fully understand the role of those sections or their intended meanings. Not because teenage readers aren't smart enough to figure it out (they are), but because they subconsciously realized how wordy and unnecessary those lines were, and never spent the time to try to chew through the fat to find the purpose.I had a few more issues with this book that are pretty hard for me to overcome as well. The time span of this book is not terribly long. So when I find the two characters professing their love for another in that matter of days, I've got problems. Even if these are kids that fall into love as often as I change shoes, it still made me roll my eyes. Especially since Hazel gives off the impression of being more mature and wiser than her young age should allow for. Maybe this was just me, but it seriously bothered me.Now, what did keep this book from the pits of Tartarus was Gus and the blind mutual friend. Everyone talks about Hazel, but I'm not sure if these guys get enough credit. Maybe they do. Hazel was witty at times, but I feel like she plays a supporting role to Gus's show-stopping performance. You better have tissues for the final 50 pages of this book. Gus will steal your heart. Their mutual friend is equally important in my opinion. A great deal of attention is spent on Hazel and Gus, but there was a lot of good lessons and powerful moments for the friend. He deserves more credit.Overall, I'm a bit torn by this book. I think it's more powerful after you read it-- one of those books that lingers for a bit so you can soak it all in. But, I don't think it's the best in the genre. If you find yourself disagreeing with me, check out Wendy Wunder's The Probability of Miracles. You might change your opinion."
2," a.I, personally selected the text because The Fault In Our Stars has been a reoccurring conversation both as a film, and as a novel. I have seen the movie, and although I did not have much interest, I wanted to compare the two forms of the Fault In Our Stars, and see how the original novel can be visualized and produced to make a popular movie. From the influence of my parents, my friends, my neighbors, anyone, they have all had experience of how the movie differs from the novel. They all talk about how the book is better than the movie or if the movie was better than the book, but I have never come down to the conclusion of making that preference. With that being said, prior to reading The Fault In Our Stars, I had heard and analyzed that this novel shows the reality and struggles of health. Most of the people who watched this movie had emotions that fluctuate from tears to happiness, and I wanted to show those emotions in both watching the movie and reading the book.b.I would recommend The Fault In Our Stars to another high school reader because I have found that this book shows the complications of love between Hazel and Augustus because of their cancer. Especially in high school, people will start to have relationship complications, as well as changes with their social life. As they will find in The Fault In Our Stars, both Hazel and Augustus have relationship complications to go along with their cancer struggles. High school students could make many connections to the book, get advice from the book, as well as finding out themselves. I would recommend The Fault In Our Stars to students in high school because they could see how Hazel shows what it is like to know your dying, as well as showing what it is like to lose someone you love. High school students could  use The Fault In Our Stars as a reference to their own personal lives, and they could recognize the reality of sickness and relationships.The Fault In Our Stars both met, and failed to meet my expectations while reading, because there is a great plot and storyline, but I would have liked to have read more about the character's health struggles. First off, the characters and their personalities matched what John Green strived to be, as well as their problems, solutions, and their relations. What I am missing from this book is more of a description of, specifically, Hazel and Augustus’s health complications. What makes The Fault In Our Stars stand out from other opposing romantic/ drama book is that there is a twist and a similarity between the two main characters; that they have cancer. I would have like to read more about their cancer and the effects of their condition, instead of just the basic and most important facts in their lives. With that being said, I still enjoyed reading the book because it includes a reality and normality in some peoples lives, which has brought out emotions in many readers and fans of The Fault In Our Stars"
3," SPOILERSI hesitated to write something negative about this book because 1) it seems like it's really popular and 2) it's about cancer, which is a serious topic and is unfortunately very real for a great number of people. But just because the main characters are teenage cancer patients doesn't make them any less of fictional constructs than they are and thus open to just as much criticism as any other fictional characters. I wouldn't talk like this about real people. But Hazel and Gus are not real. I get that in the vicarious experience of different lives that are facilitated to us by reading novels, we need to perceive fictional characters as if they were real people in order to empathize with them. And this novel's topic makes it very hard not to empathize with the main characters. And yet, I honestly didn't care for either of them. The Fault in Our Stars just didn't work for me.Part of it is probably due to the fact that I'm too old for it (although I don't feel too old for some children's books). But honestly, ten years ago, I would probably consider the Ceci n'est pas une pipe reference awesome because it was at that time that I first discovered Magritte. I might've even liked the magical hotel in Amsterdam that has rooms named after philosophers and that just happens to be the very same place the existentially challenged teenagers check in. I might have even, on some level, enjoyed the insane corniness of a random assortment of tourists applauding the kissing couple in the Anne Frank house. I might have even accepted the fact that the briefly happy couple enjoys a multi-meal super posh dinner without either of them barfing (although Hazel feels like it, but doesn't just because she's, you know, fictional). But I just didn't and I couldn't. I don't know what's wrong with me, I suppose I'm just too cynical for this or whatever (I'll get to that later). This book felt contrived and pretentious.Gus is an insufferable character and I certainly didn't regret his death. The unsmoked cigarette schtick was unbearably stupid and so was the subversion thereof, that low moment wherein Gus somehow appears at a remote gas station so he can be reduced to a pitiful shadow of his former self and Hazel can remark on it and we can all pause and reflect on the fact that cancer patients sooner or later become wretched pitiable creatures. Gus is lucikly soon revived to enjoy his last best day, so his wretchedness is short-lived. The character of Gus just didn't really come alive for me - he seemed a bit too much. His pretentiousness and handsomeness were remarked upon repeatedly, but I felt like it maybe went a bit over the top. How pretentious can you get? How many one liners can you produce in a single sentence? How well defined can the muscles of a crippled, home-bound boy be, really? Hazel's point of view. Right. Also, what an overused cliché with the sisters clueless about Gus and how to treat him - I mean, baby talk?Also, Hazel and Gus are unlucky to have cancer but they sure won the parents lottery. Their parents love not only them but amazingly, each other, and seem to be doing great in terms of coping with their kid's disease. They don't have a nervous breakdown or resort to alcoholism or adultery, instead, they seem pretty awesome. Of course, there's Van Houten to serve as the epitome of a badly coping parent and well, does he cope badly. In exchange, the other parents get a free pass to be perfect. This is not their story, though. This is Hazel's story. In case you didn't notice, the author reminds you by adding or whatever at the end of every fifth sentence in an attempt to reiterate that this story is told by a teenager or whatever.I liked some parts of this book, but then I would get to a passage that would just throw me off. For instance, these are some quotes from our narrator, Hazel: We fell asleep like that, a quantum entanglement of tubes and bodies. Now, I'm sure that this sentence is being reblogged on Tumblr as I type, probably accompanied by a beautifully tragic blurry photograph, but that won't stop me from saying that it's a stupid phrase. Because it doesn't make sense and it's a weak metaphor. I can imagine that a sixteen-year-old who once heard the phrase and focused on entanglement with a vague idea about the quantum part might very well use it just like it's used - so maybe Green is just this good and is somehow making fun of these hipster quotes. However, I'm not sure I can quite make the case for this quote: ...and then he broke down, just for one moment, his sob roaring impotent like a clap of thunder unaccompanied by lightning, the terrible ferocity that amateurs in the field of suffering might mistake for weakness. This is just too much for me, it's just so disingenuous, so purple prose, so begging to be quoted -- or whatever."
4," absolutely loved this book. Augustus is by far one of my favorite male characters of the books I've read this year. He is such a solid character that it pained me to get through the last five chapters of this book. I knew what was going to happen, since I watched the movie prior. I was actually too afraid to read the book because I didn't want to cry. But, I decided to read it none-the-less.Hazel goes through Hell. She is diagnosed with cancer and battles it throughout the novel. Then she meets Gus and things seem to look up for her. She falls in love and it's beautiful. The love she and Gus share if a flawless kind of love that we all hope to find one day in this crazy world. We all want a little piece of infinity. Sadly, her love story doesn't run on like we all want our love stories to run. Her's is short-lived. And not because of a break-up but because of a death. Which I think is the hardest part. We all know that sooner or later our loved one's will pass, it's inevitable. But, reading that the love of a teen's life passes away at such a young age is devastating.I have no idea how I would react if I was in Hazel's shoes. I'd be completely lost without my husband. I wouldn't go through the motions like she did. I'd be a lot more depressed and angrier. But she managed 'well' for someone going through this tragedy of love and loss. She handled it like she was an adult.I cried the last five chapters, I'd be lying if I said I didn't. These two became a part of my day. I'd read their story and go about my daily routine. And now their story has ended and it feels like a part of me is missing. It was a pleasure to enjoy a little infinity while reading this amazing novel. And I am hopeful to read other John Green novels, even though I strongly suspect that they will all make me cry in the end."
1," John Green’s young adult best-seller, The Fault in Our Stars, is an easy to read and heartfelt novel that reaches readers through a lightness of prose and personalities of characters, which allow readers to forget about the devastating seriousness of the subject matter. Thus, a story, which involves teenagers struggling with terminal cancer, develops into more of a light romance than the tragedy.The characters of Augustus Waters and Hazel Lancaster, are unexpectedly portrayed as hopeful, happy, and inspiring. They possess a maturity and resilience as beyond their years as they face challenges, which earn them respect in the eyes of the reader. They contemplate some of life’s most challenging concepts: love, life, what is left behind in death, with a sort of fearlessness that the reader admires. Green connects the teen’s personalities and interests in society and culture with their struggles to make them relevant.Gus and Hazel use literature, video games, and art as methods of escape and means of achieving greater understanding of what is happening to them and why. The reader sees the characters have a special regard for the arts, because unlike most people, they look for good and cherish every moment. The reader absorbs their enjoyment when they discuss their favorite author or play Max Payne, their favorite video game, together. They use the arts to experience joy, analyze their place in the universe,  and escape the lives they lead. Gus and Hazel inspire the reader to live fully, learn, and appreciate the things life has to offer. Green's lesson to his reader: No matter the circumstance, people can choose to see beauty in the world.The subject matter of the text suggests a depressing and unreadable story. Instead, the author shows that even when the worst outcomes are possible, people can thrive if they let in the love, happiness, and beauty life has to offer. If these two teenagers can make the best of their situation, so can we. Augustus and Hazel choose to remain positive, and together they are able to achieve lives that have meaning."
5," So many young adult romances these days are so serious and gloomy that it's refreshing when one comes along that is full of spirit and humor. And that's ironic in this case because the two main characters of The Fault in Our Stars have good reason to be gloomy. One has terminal cancer, and the other had his leg amputated in order to remove his cancer. Their early encounters with near-death has given Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters a jaded view on life, which shows in their witty humor. These kids aren't heroes or fighters, though that's what everyone calls them. They just happen to be dying from an anomaly of their bodies. Yet they learn how to enjoy the small things and to find love, which is important. This story, despite its subject matter, had me laughing for most of it. When it gets to the final stretch, when things grow predictably gloomy, I grew bored, but I can see the appeal to the many readers who have fallen in love with John Green's tale.The first two-thirds of this book are fantastic. Hazel is an intelligent, hilarious narrator, and the dialogues between her and Gus are full of energy and wit. Green has the courage to write teenage characters who are smart when so many other teenage characters in YA fiction try not to be so smart. The dialogue, I'll admit, is not entirely believable, but what matters is that the dialogue is lots of fun. It isn't aiming to be real. It's very much like Diablo Cody's Juno, another teenager who spoke with too much wit, but without which the movie wouldn't have been so fantastic. I laughed out loud a lot while reading this book, and it's not often a book allows me to do that.But, of course, this is a book about cancer, and most any book about cancer has a part where you will cry. You will cry because the person with cancer dies, or you will cry because they overcome all odds and survive. Either way, there is that serious moment when things look bad, or when you just don't know what will happen, and that's no different for this book. The problem is, the book gets really dull. The last third loses much of its energy, inevitably, and while it never gets bad, Green does a lot of philosophical explaining, and none of it is particularly mind-blowing stuff. This last third of the book, more than the rest, is a meditation on life, on the fact that everyone is a part of this world for a brief amount of time, but some people are on it for an even briefer amount of time. The book grasps at an over-reaching philosophy on life's grand meaning, and ends up finding a new way to say something not all that new.Not that I mean to bring a gloomy note to the end of my review. John Green is clearly a talented and very imaginative writer. What makes The Fault in Our Stars so enjoyable is that its sole mission is not to elevate these cancer kids to the status of heroes. The book's mission is to make them human, make them real, and make them into people you wouldn't mind having as a friend. These aren't gloomy kids seeking pity, or pitying themselves (not all the time, but everyone does that now and then). These are kids trying to enjoy life, to make it as normal as possible, which means getting frustrated with people who treat them like little saints. Despite its dances with death, The Fault in Our Stars has a rebellious joy for life, dancing in the face of the universe."
4," have had this book on my To Read list for months and, in fact, checked it out of the library once before and returned it un-read. I didn't even flip the cover, but after my last few book selections being disappointing, I put my faith in GoodReads reviews.I started this book on a flight this afternoon and just finished it after getting home. Once I started, I was hooked and devoured it in a matter of hours.I don't know that I will be able to fully describe my enjoyment, but will do my best. The author grabbed my attention and did a phenomenal job in character development and seducing me into the story. His writing is addictive, unpredictable (at least to me!) and rounded. The story was so well balanced that I was engaged throughout the storyline, and my heartstrings were tugged in unexpected ways. This story was one I anticipate will live within me, much like Catcher in the Rye did. It's just a beautifully crafted story of adolescent growth, maturity, love, reality, and grasp for understanding the incomprehensible.I sit here with red eyes and an aching heart, but grateful that authors like John Green are able to share their gifts. His creativity and passion is evident, and a reminder that in our technology driven world where anyone can author a blog or self publish, that there can be night and day differences between an author and an artist. John Green, I consider this book a masterpiece.5 stars. I would (er, will!) recommend this to everyone.Warning: when you start getting around the 75% mark, grab tissues. I was thankful I got there in the privacy of my own home or I would have turned some heads on the plane. Extra concealer may be required tomorrow for my red eyes (and sleep deprivation staying up to finish... waiting was simply not an option!).UPDATE: Saw the movie. Loved the movie. Felt the movie did the book justice! But read the book first!"
4," OMG The Fault in Out Stars has got to be one of the best novels I've ever read. Like ever.Sorry, I had to. I'm fan-girling right now.It's not so much a cancer book as I first assumed it to be. I thought this novel would be about how Hazel, the main protagonist, handles death and how she battles cancer, and how she thinks super deep about the meaning of life or whatever.  However, I was indefinitely wrong.  Instead, I find myself amidst a novel with a humor to tragedy ratio of 1:1. (BTW I kind of just quoted the book. You didn't think I was that good at applying math to real life, did you?) This novel is poignant, but also feisty, like a real person.  Hazel isn't that much the main character, or, at the very least, she isn't the real one making all the smart remarks and stringing a bunch of fancy words that I cannot seem to understand together. She IS the narrator, yet she's more of the eyes than the mind to the reader. It's Augustus (The guy. Yes. There is a guy.) and a made-up book and author (In this novel, the REAL author refers to a made-up book and author a lot.)  that gives us insight to how death works, and what our purpose on Earth is. Hazel is more of the window covering an antique, so that we have someplace to look in on, yet Augustus is the guide, telling us what we are actually looking at, and how everything works.  (I swear, I only just read 73 pages and I can already sense my English improving. I wonder what will happen when I read the rest of the book. Seventy-three pages down, only two hundred forty to go.)  Now, I won't spoil anything, or give the ending away (Yeah, I peeked at the end. It was inadvertent, I swear!) but what a sad, tragic ending. Of course, I kind of surmised the ending, anyway, since this is a realistic piece of work. There are rarely happy endings in reality, so there is no happy ending in this made-up world.  This novel is so unconventional, as are the characters. Apparently, the teenagers share a disdain for the conventional, and both have an acerbic wit. The language is slightly difficult, but it just makes the novel even more appealing. I mean, what other novel you know uses phrases like: Our triumphantly digitized contemporaneity? (This phrase was referring to how the younger generation is obsessed with technology.) Another phrase: Barnacles on the container ship of consciousness. (This one was referring to how Hazel thinks EVERYTHING is a side effect of dying. This particular phrase is referring to how Hazel says everyone is normal, and how we're all just annoying pests on a boat of consciousness.) If you don't get it, then you either don't understand it, or you haven't read the book yet. For me, it's more the former rather than the latter."
5," This was possibly one of the best books I've ever read. That's saying alot, since I've read some really good book in my ten whole years. (Yes, I am ten. Don't judge me.)  Anywho, Th Fault in Our Stars is basically about this girl who has cancer. The girl (who's name is Hazel Grace Lancaster) meets a cancer survivor named Augustus Waters. Cleshé? I think not!! Well, there's also  boy named Issac who's having his freaking eyeballs cut out of his head. But more on him later.  So Hazel and Augustus start to have a bumpy friend/more than friend relationship. Then, Hazel lands in the ICU, and that's where things between the two start getting EVEN MORE BUMPY. He's in love with her, she thinks of herself as grenade. *sigh* Oh, Hazel. The rest? You'll have to find out for yourself 'cause I've already given away too many spoilers. ;)  I suppose the book is also slightly medically educational, as well. About cancer and other deadly diseases.  Really, I think that this book deserves like, the Nobel Peace Prize. (And yes, I know that book can't receive privelages like that, but a child can dream!) So, finally, here's an up close and personal with all the charcters:Hazel: (Hazel Grace Lancaster) Lung tumor that turned into cancer. Diagnosed when thirteen. 17yrs; has already gotten GED, and now taking classes at NCC. (or something like that.)Gus: (Augustus Waters) Leg cancer (that's what I like to call it) which follwed in, how do you say, the Amputation of The Leg. Diagnosed when sixteen. 17yrs; has not gotten GED, and so is still in highschool.Issac: Eyeball cancer which led to the Cutting of The Eyeballs Out of The Face. Diagnosed when UNCLEAR. 17yrs; has not gotten GED, and so is still in highschool.SAVE THE FUZZBUCKETS!!! DON't JUDGE ME!"
5," bought this book ages ago, probably around Christmas time when it was on sale because I'm a big fan of buying things on sale. I hadn't actually intended  to read it now, but when I saw that J. Hooligan from Platypire Reviews was reading it, I figured why not. We were supposed to buddy read, but Joood betrayed me and finished the book before I was even a quarter of the way in. She told me not to read it, it was a horrible idea, but I was already committed.TFioS has been out long enough that you surely already know it's a tear jerker. Going in I was pretty sure I'd be able to stand strong and not shed a single tear because I'm kind of heartless sometimes. I was wrong. Tears were shed on two occasions. If you haven't read TFioS yet, have tissues handy, you'll need them.My initial feelings about this book were that it was kind of depressing and unrealistic, two kids with cancer falling in love etc, I mean what are the chances, but then I started to really think about it, and it really does make a certain amount of sense. I could feel the pointlessness of trying to associate with normals on a regular basis. While they're understanding, they can't really understand what life with cancer is like so they're constantly trying not to upset you, but sometimes people trying not to upset you can be incredibly upsetting all on it's own. I enjoyed the sarcastic banter between the characters, the way they were able to joke about their cancer. It was clearly the way they coped with their crummy situation and it's how I think I would try to cope if I found myself in their shoes.I got really excited when they got to Amsterdam because I've been there. Most of the things they mentioned (canal cruise, Anne Frank Huis, Rijksmuseum) I've seen so I could picture it easily and it was awesome for me. The descriptions of Amsterdam were spot on and made me want to go back so badly. I legit want to run away from home to visit Amsterdam again, right now because of this book.The thing I hated about this book (but also loved because it inspired such a strong desire in me) is that An Imperial Affliction doesn't exist! I wanted to buy a copy of it, and read it, and see what Hazel saw in the story, but I can't!!! John Green is currently on my sh*t list for making me want a book that doesn't exist so badly.Overall I give TFioS 5 out of 5 stars and would recommend it to just about everybody."
5," NOT what I expected. While the story COULD have been EPIC it was somehow dull due the WAY too philosophical view both main characters had it also felt ABSOLUTELY pointless.Hazel and Augustus meet in a therapy group. Hazel is struggling with cancer, she knows she isn't going to make it but the treatment she is getting now somehow prolongs the ending giving her a bit more time (while don't really knowing what a bit means). She is sick, has to have oxygen tank with her at all times and she is quite detached from the lives around her (almost) except for her parents. Meeting Augustus and becoming fast friends is NOT what she was expecting. Yet it happens nevertheless.Augustus comes to the group for the sake of his friend Isaac who will be losing his sight in the near future. Augustus had his brush with cancer. Not long ago his right leg was amputated. As Hazel reminds him of his previous girlfriend she strikes his interest but that's the only resemblance. They both enjoy each other's company and want to be with each other yet Hazel is reluctant as it's obvious to her she will have to leave him behind. Probably shattered if their relationship would develop and he would care for her. Yet somewhere along the way she can't really hold on to her resolve as she is falling for him as much as he falls for her.They have a grand time together. Even with the sickness and difficulties their friendship was sweet, innocent and yet mature beyond their years. They might be teenagers (about 17 years old) yet what they went through and their unique selves makes them much more than that. It was amazing seeing how much they got out of life and situations that weren't so good yet their company together and how they interpreted things made it all okay somehow.I'm going to say something horrible - at a certain part of this book I felt like I was dying. Dying with Hazel, being buried in the mumble jumble of Hazel's thoughts that are SO philosophical I was bored to tears. This book could have been SO GOOD, and yet it was so NOT what I wanted it to be. It was brave and unique in the fact that it dealt with cancer as I never imagined possible, including being FUNNY! A Laugh Out Loud Funny! Yet for me, with all the philosophical talk of Hazel and Augustus - the emotional part, the part that has heart and soul of an individual was totally and absolutely lost to me.There was something totally futile about the whole thing. Why did we live through Hazel's eyes during the whole of this book? why did we meet Augustus or his friend Isaac. What was the whole point of this book. I dare say it again. It was FUTILE and not in the funny Schwarzenegger way. It was just totally meaningless. The whole thing.The beginning was good, or rather better, since it was funnier and felt somehow more real than most novels do as it dealt with life - difficult life - without being apologetic. It just is, or was. Both Hazel and Augustus deals with something SO terrible and as teenagers which can be difficult without the might be dying thing.. I wanted to root for the both of them. To see them together even though the minimal reviews you read of this one tells you to prepare your handkerchiefs (do people actually carry ones anymore? I dare say I have an answer to it that I WON'T elaborate on...) so I was totally prepared for the worst and NOT the Happily Ever After. Not that I'm saying anything ABOUT the ending. It's just what I was expecting.. (I'm TRYING not to spoiler here! please appreciate ;)). Yet again, the futility of it all.. God! I'll just quote darling Fred here.. Geez grandpa what did you read me this thing for? (an unforgettable quote from an unforgettable movie - The Princess Bride).It wasn't a horrible book but for me it's definitely wasn't a good one either. It had a HUGE potential that TOTALLY got lost when the author tried being too damn smart. Sometimes a book needs to be happy, sad, stupid, funny - just BE! and not overly analyzed. That's my opinion.. I know MANY MANY loved it, yet I couldn't find a real interest. I kept reading because I DID want to know how it end, yet I did it reluctantly - it was so DAMN boring! I don't even know what it says about me that I could read of (imaginary) human pain and feel absolutely nothing. If it makes me a bad person so be it..I will admit to shedding a few tears over this one. I guess it's almost impossible not to. Yet it wasn't a very emotional book in my eyes. It was a philosophical one (how many times have I wrote the word Philosophical in this review? that should explain my annoyance I think..).But just so we don't finish this review with a grim feel - a short funny tale - On my first year of my BA I had one course in Philosophy. It was SO boring I could hardly keep up with the lecturer. She was a nice person, and very invested in what she was teaching but as you can guess from my review - yeah, it wasn't my thing exactly.. Back then I just brought home Eric's mother a puppy Great Dane and as I only had two courses that day I brought her to class. But Uli was bored to tears as well! I should say she wasn't as bored at Statistics as she was bored with Philosophy 101! ONLY on Philosophy's lessons she would yawn SO loudly it was embarrassing how much she was channeling me! Dogs usually yawn when they are frustrated not tired (what do they have to be tired about anyway?!). She never acted this way in ANY other course I brought her to. So thinking of both of us I stopped going to that class. Didn't get an amazing score in that one as you could guess but Uli and myself's mental health graded more.Tags: Young Adult RomanceMore Reviews - http://ultrameital.blogspot.co.il"
2," read this book two years ago when it first came out, and since I am super pumped for the movie, I decided it was time to reread it in preparation. I'm so glad that I did because the second time around was just a whole lot better!The Fault in Our Stars follows Hazel Grace Lancaster, a 16-year-old cancer patient who believes that she is just a side effect of life. When Hazel Grace goes to a Cancer Kid Support Group that her mother makes her go to every week, she meets Augustus Waters, a boy who she believes would've never payed any attention to a girl such as herself, yet Gus does.The relationship that Augustus and Hazel Grace have is just so sweet and amazing. They're really good together and they both have an excellent sense of humor that I never got bored of. I really loved their friend Isaac, who was also a member of the Cancer Kid Support Group. He was just so funny, and the egg-throwing scene was my favorite scene from the entire book, hands down.I loved all the little things that Gus did for Hazel Grace; it was just so cute. He cares about Hazel Grace so deeply. I also really loved how the both of them just lived in the moment, not letting a second pass by where they aren't doing something that they enjoy. I definitely learned quite a few life lessons from Hazel Grace and Gus.I absolutely love John Green's writing style, and I know that I'll definitely need to read the rest of his books now. I've also read Paper Towns and Looking for Alaska, with Looking for Alaska being my favorite John Green book thus far. John Green has this way of writing that just immerses the reader into the character's world so vividly, and he has this way of grasping onto the reader's heart and making them feel so deeply for each and every one of the characters. I definitely can't wait for this movie to come out!"
2," This is, by far, one of the hardest reviews I have had to write. I had actually won a print copy of this book in a giveaway or contest or blogging event of some sort last year, though I cannot currently remember which. I then proceeded to use my audible credit to acquire it this month. I then took the Kindle version out from a friend's public library (as she was kind enough to allow me to use her login for ebooks, since she does not use the service and my library sucks).I read this book in about 24 hours, and my emotions are so all over the place that I fear this review will be incoherent and rambling at best, but I have to write it. I have to get the thoughts out of my head or I will not be able to sleep. This is the second night in a row that this book has kept me awake.I both love and hate this book and the author right now. I am so thoroughly pissed at the outcome, and then also so thoroughly lost for the unanswered questions that I am left with. Much like An Imperial Affliction left Hazel struggling, desperate to know what happens before she dies, I have the same kind of inner turmoil over the outcome for this book.Additionally, I thought that I would be forever changed for having seen A Walk to Remember, and this was an even grander roller coaster ride. I feel as a soaking wet towel, wrung vigorously and left hanging in a twist over the shower curtain. I am not even sure how to put this into words properly.John Green has taken my shriveled cynical heart and left it bleeding on the floor, utterly without a sense of why it is no longer within the confines of my ribcage. I was so invested in the characters of Gus and Hazel, and I now wonder what I will do without their story to fill my heart. Damn you, John Green! Why must you toy with my emotions so. Now I have to go read more of your books so that I can be ripped apart even more."
5,"’m feeling sassy this afternoon. Blame it on a bout of anxiety. And in feeling like such, I’m going to post a review on The Fault in our Stars. I hated it. Most people loved it. I have many similar problems with this book that I did with All the Bright Places. (See review).First off, the characters. Hazel Grace Lancaster and Augustus sdlkfaj Waters are two of the most pretentious old-but-not-really characters I’ve ever met. They are flat and speak as if they each have a Doctorate’s degree in philosophy hanging on their walls.They are essentially the same person and they make incredibly insipid observations about he world around them. Like such:“Why are breakfast foods breakfast foods…Like, why don’t we have curry for breakfast?”Uhh, people do eat curry for breakfast, dipwad. You’d think with as smart as she is, she’d know a little about other cultures.“A nonhot boy stares at you relentlessly and it is, at best, awkward and, at worst, a form of assault.But a hot boy . . . well.”............Another thing that I have a problem with is their romance. Augustus stares at her when they are in their first meeting together. STARES AT HER. That’s not cute. That’s mother-effin’ creepy! I’m not against love at first sight or anything, but COME ON. Then they take advantage of a charity and take this trip to Amsterdam to meet a piece-of-shit author and they end up kissing in the house where ANNE FRANK WAS CAPTURED. Ew. ew. ewwwwww. And everyone around them is okay with this? *keeps reading* They’re clapping?? CLAPPING?These quotes are particularly worthy of the eye-roll.“My thoughts are stars I cannot fathom into constellations.”“I believe the universe wants to be noticed. I think the universe is improbably biased toward the consciousness, that it rewards intelligence in part because the universe enjoys its elegance being observed. And who am I, living in the middle of history, to tell the universe that it-or my observation of it-is temporary?”Wut?Gag.Also, this book has one giant flaw with me. One of my big red buttons you should never ever push. It’s romanticizing dying, death and the ill. They are dying. Yes. It’s sad. Yes. The characters however, were so damn annoying and shallow I did not cry at the end of this book. Nope.Throughout this whole book, cancer and death are being treated like some magical beings that grant you the ability to love and to feel and make your life actually worth something since you have so little of it. That’s not how it is at all. People don’t suddenly feel like their life is so important or good and they certainly don’t start speaking soliloquy. Just take a look at one of our local college professors who died recently of cancer. He didn’t find any meaning to his life. He didn’t suddenly gain an appreciation for things. He was MAD. He took no visitors, no gifts, phone calls, nothing. He died relatively alone and angry. I knew the one friend who visited him and it was really hard to do. She could see his anger.Just because a book makes you feel all the feels doesn’t mean it’s a masterpiece. If anything, I want to cry because it was so terrible.Don’t even get me started on that stupid cigarette thing that Augustus does. That’s got to be the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard of."
5," The Fault in Our Stars (2012) is a teen novel written by bestselling author John Green. Our narrator, Hazel, is a seventeen-year-old young woman coping with terminal thyroid cancer. At heart, Hazel is a reader, philosopher, and introspective person, wise beyond her limited years. But not unrealistically so (in her parents’ words, she can also act “very teenagery”). Through a church-based Cancer Support Group, which Hazel’s mother makes her attend (although Hazel finds them to be rather trite and cheesy) Hazel unexpectedly meets her match: the precocious, clever and irresistibly sexy amputee and fellow cancer survivor, Augustus Waters. But as Hazel feels she is a “grenade,” with reference to her terminal illness, she’s reluctant to take on a new friend, or engage in any kind of serious relationship, for fear of hurting yet another person when her time of death should come.This may sound like a depressing novel, but amazingly, it isn’t. In fact, it is one of the funniest, warmest and addictive novels I’ve read. That’s not to say it’s without heartbreaking moments. Like most fellow readers, I did cry. But mostly, I was charmed by the main characters: who they were, their thoughtfulness and unique approaches to life and death; and their struggles for meaning – or acceptance of a lack thereof – while the rest of the world comforts itself with tired proverbs.John Green is a poet with a brilliant mind. His simple yet masterful prose contains no clichés. And while Hazel can sometimes be flippant, saucy and downright blasphemous, she has one of the most honest approaches to cancer and mortality I’ve ever considered. I’ve never read a book quite like this, and am not sure what to compare it with. But it resonated with me. Another side story in this unforgettable novel, which I cannot fail to mention, is the mystery of the reclusive author of Hazel’s favorite novel. She and Augustus embark on an unlikely overseas adventure to Amsterdam to meet this author, a surprising encounter that had me on the edge of my seat.Read this novel. The Fault in Our Stars is a triumphant, witty, irreverent and thought-provoking book worth your time. Yes, you may cry. But you won’t regret it!"
1," often like to read some of the one star reviews of books after I have read the book. Everyone has an opinion and it is fascinating to read the opinions of people who hated this book when the vast majority of people have loved it. One complaint that seems to be common in the one  star reviews is that teenagers don't talk as the way they are portrayed in this book. I can see that. I do not know any teenagers who speak like Augustus and at the same time I think that cancer can probably make one grow up a lot faster and it is a book and fiction, and even if you don't think no teenagers speak like they do, isn't it cool to think of some who would?I read a complaint or two that the characters sounded alike. I don't agree with that at all. They read very differently to me and the fact that two characters can come together and riff on a joke doesn't mean sound alike, just means they have similar tastes in humor. I also don't understand why people are upset over the kiss in the Anne Frank musuem. I thought that whole scene was touching. If I saw two kids, one with obvious signs of cancer, kissing there, I'd probably think it was nice. To each their own though. Also, they are teenagers, so falling in love so quickly is not unreal. Shoot most of us know adults who 'fall in love' quickly, whether that is 'real love' - whatever that means - or something else, is up for the individual to decide.I really liked the book. I am giving it four stars instead of five because I don't love it. I won't be reading it again and that is usually the criteria I have for five stars. It is a fun and touching book to read, especially if you like sassy philosophically musing. I like the story arc with the author from Amsterdam. It reminded me of when I was a teenager and I was obsessed with an author or celebrity. I think having cancer would be extremely tough and I liked that this book showed a different side to it rather than the cliche side. I think the main characters were fully formed with their own issues/secrets they struggled with and held from each other. Some may call Augustus selfish or dishonest, but we are all selfish at various times and have done things we are not proud of, especially when we were teenagers.I'd recommend this book to everyone, except probably my most cynical of friends who only believe in reading 'high literature.'"
5," Do you ever find yourself not wanting to read a book that's been hyped up a lot? I won a hardback copy of this book over a year ago. Everyone was raving about it. Consistently bloggers and friends I trust were rating it 5 stars. So I KNEW it was a good book. I KNEW I would love it. And I also KNEW that it would make me cry. At the time of receiving the book I was emotionally drained from some other heavy books and needed light and fun and easy reads. A year later I still hadn't read it and the movie was a few months from coming out. So my sister-n-law's and I planned a beach trip that also coincided with the release of the movie. Not being a very long book I read it in 2 days. And I boo-hoo'd through the last 125ish pages. Snot.Nosed.Crying!Guess what? The raving, and the hype and the building up was definitely deserved!Hazel is a 16 year old girl who has terminal cancer. What started out as thyroid cancer when she was 13 has developed into stage 4 cancer that has spread to her lungs. Upon her mom's and doctor's insistence she attends a support group for kids with cancer. It's here that she meet's Isaac. A boy who lost an eye to cancer and is facing losing his other eye. It's here during her second visit that she meets Isaac's best friend: the witty, charismatic and handsome Augustus Waters.The first half of the book is filled with great humor in an otherwise serious story. It keeps you smiling and laughing out loud. Then BAM, just like that the seriousness of the book and their situation hits you like a sledge hammer and the tears start flowing. (Be sure you have a box of tissues nearby) Even as sad as it is, and how emotional I was, I feel like I gained something in my heart by reading the story of Hazel Grace and Augustus. I gained a small glimpse into what cancer patients - especially young people - go through. Seriously, if you never read any other piece of fiction - read this story.Favorite Quotes:Look, let me just say it: He was hot. A nonhot boy stares at you relentlessly and it is, at best, awkward and, at worst, a form of assault. But a hot boy...well.I liked that he was a tenured professor in the Department of Slightly Crooked Smiles with a dual appointment in the Department of Having a Voice That Made My Skin Feel More Like Skin.But you keep the promise anyway. That's what love is. Love is keeping the promise anyway.As he read, I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once.I'm in love with you, and I'm not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things. I'm in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, and I am in love with you....I cannot tell you how thankful I am for our little infinity. I wouldn't trade it for the world. You gave me a forever within the numbered days, and I'm grateful.Final Rating - An overwhelming 5 stars!!"
4," This is a beautiful book of two young people who know they are not going to live very long.  Hazel Grace Lancaster tells the story, but she wants to be called just Hazel.  Her mother insists she join a Support Group for young people with cancer located in a church.  She doesn't want to.  Hazel hasn't gone to school since she was thirteen.  She is now sixteen.  She has thyroid cancer which settled in her lungs.  She wheels around a tank of oxygen and has a tube that carries oxygen to her lungs.  Her only friend in this group is Isaac, a boy her age, who has one eye removed, the other threatened.  So many of the kids are dead, this is a come and go group.  Then into her life comes Augustus Waters, handsome, once a terrific basketball player who now has a prosthetic leg.  Before he came along, her only friends are her parents, Peter Van Houton, she never met him but he wrote her favorite book, An Imperial Affliction.  Her once best friend, Kaitlyn, now has a different life.  But the girls get together once in awhile though it's hard going places dragging an oxygen tank with people starring.  Especially being so young.  At one time, Hazel overhead her mother say to her dad I will miss being a mom.  Some medication came along that is giving Hazel more time.  She is an only child.Then along comes Augustus.  He has two older half sisters and is the only one home.  He loves her as she loves him.  He is seventeen.  A time comes, a chance for the two to go to Amsterdam, This gift is being donated by a group for children and teen agers who are terminal.  Hazel can meet her favorite in the world writer.  So away the two go and why not.  Hazel's mom accompanies them.  The two must grasp at the little time they have on this earth.  Amsterdam is a magical city, they have a magical time, they go to a very expensive restaurant, the food is great and they have champagne for the first time in their lives.  Augusts has osteosarcoma.  The two wonder if they will have imput on the world when they are gone.The book takes place during a hot summer in Indianapolis, Indiana.  Each writes the others eulogy.  Who will go first?  There is much good to be said about this book.  Grab at life, it's too short, not appreciated.  In Amsterdam the kids visit the Ann Frank House.  Ann Frank died at a very early age, a tragic death.  The book is humorous, fun read, depressing yes and no.  There is a lot philsosophy talk about life and death.  Plus a lot of love. How these kids enjoy each other.  There comes a moment when Grace is with two other young cancer patients and she realizes of the three she is the healthiest."
5," hesitate to even write this. I mean, this book already has 34K+ reviews, so perhaps no one will ever read this. But, I write this for the ONE that might.First, let me give credit where it's due: This book is superbly well-written, showcasing Green's breadth and depth of knowledge (everything from medicine to Amsterdam). The story is compelling and engaging, and the characters (even Mr Van Houten, in some regards) are endearing. As a fellow Hoosier, I appreciated the Indiana landmarks and had to resist the urge to go visit Holliday Park again. And, what to many is unbelievable, I found the most enjoyable: the depth of the teenagers. Many adults might say teenagers are not this deep or insightful. Yet, as a high school English teacher, I'd say Green nails it. I've read enough essays in my day to know that these insightful teenagers totally exist, but are simply not given the right platform to be heard.Now, here's my beef: In short, the underpinning philosophy and worldview of this book are fatalistic. And while Green may be trying to enlighten us all, he's inadvertently mocking God and killing reasonable faith in the process. I'm seriously concerned that teenagers (or even adults) might take some of these purported truths seriously.In chp. 23, Green's worldview is somewhat spelled out for us when Hazel has a conversation with Isaac--Gus told us that he feared oblivion, and I told him that he was fearing something universal and inevitable, and how really, the problem is not suffering itself or oblivion itself but the depraved meaningless of these things, the absolutely inhuman nihilism of suffering...what we want is to be noticed by the universe, to have the universe give a s*** what happens to us...So, there you have it. The wise, all-knowing Hazel pretty much lays out the basic premises pushed on us in this novel: (1) Life is meaningless, (2) There is nothing BUT this life, so no afterlife, (3) Suffering is pointless, (4) The universe doesn't care about us.OK, so we could debate all these points with an entire book. Maybe even volumes, nay entire libraries. But, my point is simply this: Green so craftily pushes this worldview (cancer-ridden teenagers, romance, emotional topic, etc.) that many won't even notice that they've let these ultimately depressing thoughts form roots and maybe even take hold. And, Hazel might seem to be pretty chill about a meaningless life with no afterlife, but rest assured--the normal person is not. There is no comfort in accepting these things. Life is full of meaning. There is an afterlife, and there's a beautiful point to suffering. And, as for the universe, it cares about us because its Creator does. Read The Fault in Our Stars with eyes wide open and refuse to accept Hazel's thought-provoking, but faulty, musings as absolute truths."
5," An Infinity Amount of StarsIt's taken me two weeks to conjure up the right and deserving words I have for this book.Per its genre of Young Adult, I hope none of the audience missed the proverbial meaning intended in this story. The Fault In Our Stars is incredibly deep in so many profound ways, which made me want to shake the author's hand when I finished the last sentence.This book wasn't about dying, it was about life after death. Hazel spent her days worrying about what might happen to her parents after her expected final day. She wanted to make an impact, but a positive one. She wanted their happiness to remain intact after she was gone. This was her fear throughout reading An Imperial Affliction. She was only focused on an ending that went beyond the main character's life. She wanted a resolution for the other characters; to know they would survive the MC's life. This was her fear, not dying of cancer. The cancer was inevitable, life after she was gone, was not.While Agustus didn't seem to have the same fears, his focus was on Hazel getting her answers. A selfless dying young man wanted the best for someone he grew to love. This is something you might find in a person well beyond the age of eighteen. But when your days are numbered, you age quickly, and you find the meaning of life faster than others. This again, in my opinion, shows what happens when the fast forward button is pressed on life. I feel that everyone learns what they need to learn throughout their existence, but some are forced to learn it faster.I don't think this story was meant to be a romance, I think it was meant to show the meaning of life, and that in the end...there will be a life after us.(view spoiler)Truly heartwarming, emotional, and deep: The Fault In Our Stars belongs at #1 for a great reason. This is not a book to miss out on.Okay? Okay. &lt;3On a side note: The movie was spectacular and did the book an incredible justice."
2,"m going to start out by saying that this book was amazing! The Fault In Our Stars turned two topics that weren't necessarily my favorites (cancer and romance novels) into one of the best books I have ever read. The way that John Green writes this story is wonderful: he writes it in the way that topics such as the ones i mentioned above can become a book you do not want to put down (I know I couldn't). One of the major reasons I like this book so much, being a guy, is that it shows the struggle of relationships from a guys point of view also, instead of just from the females point of view like most romantic novels. Another reason I really enjoyed this book was that, being a teenager in today's society, I could relate to how the world can affect who you are and who you become. Also, I can relate to the teenage relationship struggles because I have had those too, so kudos to John Green for accurately showing how teenage relationships can be difficult.This story is about a 16-year old girl named Hazel Grace who has cancer in her lungs, and she meets a boy named Augustus (represented as Gus in the story) who had cancer previously and had lost a leg to it. These two characters immediately hit it off with just a simple look into each other's eyes across the room during Support Group. Then after that moment they become great friends and go through many fun/depressing/sad/intense moments where crying or smiling are the only two options. During the story, Hazel realizes that she is slowly falling in love with the little things about Augustus, while he has liked her from the very beginning. This story, in my opinion, accurately shows how teenagers of the opposite sex could be nowadays, which I really liked.I recommend this book to mainly 14-early 20s because this story is about the struggles of being a teenager in today's society, and I don't believe that anyone older than being in their early 20s would understand today as us youngsters do, but anyone younger than 14 would probably not be able to relate to the relationships and the flirting that happens in this book, and the language might be a little strong also.I am man enough to say that as a 14 male, this book brought me to tears.I hope to read more John Green books in hope that they are as great as this one!"
5," Hmmm...I have mixed feelings about this book. I can totally understand why teens love it. I have been reading quite a few books this year that were really for teens. Partly because I remember really good literature from when I was growing up that I read such as L'Engle's Wrinkle in Time, and I first read Lord of the Rings back as a teenager. I really enjoyed other books such as The Book Thief, and I read all of the Hunger Game books. Because I'm Deaf, I prefer to read books first before I see the movie, but my granddaughters wanted to see the movie, so I was actually reading the book at the same time as when I saw the movie. As per usual, I thought the book was slightly better than the movie, although they really took the dialogue right from the book. The book gave more to the imagination than the movie did.So what bothers me about the book? Part of it is the fact that I got a strong feeling the book was actually written with a movie in mind.. Books like the ones I mentioned above, stand well alone...they don't seem to be written for a movie. Even the Hunger Games, which we have all been seeing and hearing about for several years now (and the Harry POtter series), the writing is really good in these books. We will have to see what the future brings, but I think the books I've mentioned will continue to draw readers for years, while this book will not stand the test of time. The writing just isn't there in this book. It is not a great piece of literature. It was written to sell.That's kind of too bad, because the topic is one that should be explored. Children and teens are not supposed to die of cancer. But they do, and their stories should be told. But I don't like tear jerkers usually, I don't choose to read those along with my science, and history, and classics. I would probably recommend the book to teens to read if this is the kind of stuff they like, but it wouldn't be my first choice."
5," Quote: I missed the future.My enthusiasm for this book is enormous and Oh, Hazel how you crept into my soul.The best stories always manage to find that raw ache of humanity in you and draw it out long enough for you to examine closely... sometimes these fictions allow you to take something of their shimmer with you for years to come, sometimes they engage your emotions to pay homage through evocative physicality--you cry, laugh, champion the hero with vocal enthusiasm, but seldom do novels reach directly into your nervous system and tear at you in a way you know you'll never forget--The Fault of Our Stars is, in this visceral manner, an unforgettable book.Hazel's eyes guide, as the tale follows her fatalistic acceptance of her illness, her need to be loved, and her intensely keen, often scathing, but mostly intelligent attitude to the gaggle of characters surrounding her. Her reluctance to be horrified by the fact that she might become an unsung statistic of demise is utterly charming-- what she fears is pain, and her pursuit in avoiding it, in both its physical as well as its psychological sense, is astonishing, but, Hazel, being the Hazel she is, is more terrified of causing it for others than she is of feeling it herself, a remarkable sixteen-year-old, don't you think?The romance Hazel is indulged in by Augustus Waters, is so fragile in its tender beauty that it will crack you open (even if you're not a brittle type). Augustus, whom Hazel meets at one of her cancer survivor meetings, is the the polar opposite of everything cancer stands for, he is the perfect Adonis-With-Brains-and-Heart, he believes in hope, he wants to be more than a statistic, he cares for his friends and he cares about them. Mostly, however, he simply adores Hazel and her quirky witticisms, her 'Pixie-Look', and her yearning intellect. He is gorgeous, and also a cancer 'beater ', despite his sacrifice of half a leg to the wicked cause.The novel focuses on Hazel and her devotion to her 'Best-Ever-Novel', written by a reclusive, one-time author. The book unites the feature protagonists, Hazel Grace and Gus Waters in an endeavor to discover the outcome of the unsatisfactory ending provided by the author of the book they have both come to adore. The premise that perfection in life is achieved by enjoying a long, healthy, wealthy and carefree life full of joyful art and entertainment is challenged so poignantly in this tale that the reality the author reveals through his delightfully clever manipulation of the trials the characters encounter and youthful first-kiss-love they find, is a marvel to behold. Truth always leaves you a little breathless, and of course, memories are all anyone has of the good times they have enjoyed, the picture in the mind is no less dull if the time taken to achieve that enjoyment was as brief as it was perfect. Ultimately that's all anyone gets out of life."
3," The Fault in Our Stars follows the story or Augustus Waters and Hazel Grace as they fight their battles with cancer and reflect on the life they've lived. Augustus and Hazel are very real characters and John Green manages to capture their personalities as well as the tragedy of their situations and past situations.Augustus is a very charismatic and funny guy, his dialogue is classicly 'teen' and I found myself laughing out loud with Hazel! Hazel is very sweet and through her friendship with Augustus, learns to come out of her shell and make connections with people that she was otherwise leaving behind. Isaac and Hazel's parents are well written and believable side characters as well as Peter Van Houten, who is a comical but also tragic character whose life is changed by Gus and Hazel who make him come to realise errors in his behaviour...but not before it's too late.The development between Hazel and Augustus is slow but there during the course of the book as they open up to each other and explain why they do things and the pace at which it happens is steady.I do think that at the end it dragged on a bit though, but perhaps that was to give the reader time to cry and collect their feelings with Hazel and Augustus at the end.Overall, The Fault in Our Stars was a very tragic book, but uplifting in the end as some questions since the start of the book get an answer. I would recommend it to people who enjoy realistic fiction and romance novels and am planning to read the rest of John Green's work.5 out of 5 stars for a wonderful book, believable storyline and raw, true and epic love.Some infinities are bigger than other infinities.-Hazel Grace"
5," loved this book more than not. I am planning for a career in Pediatric Oncology as a Research Nurse and this book was a fabulous insight into the children who face this horrible disease.This is my honest review.This book is depressing, but in an optimistic light. Optimistic because larger than life concepts are discussed here; this is not a teenager worried over being cool. This is a teenager who is facing life with a disease numbering her days. She has grasped what she has in this lifetime. Her perspectives are blunt, philosophical, and sadly relevant.Her vocabulary is huge. This is where I was not so excited- I enjoy learning new words reading. When a sentence is FULL of huge, not commonly used words though, it's a bit overwhelming to understand what's going on. I'm thankful for instantly being able to look up words on Kindle. I usually gather from context and root words what a word means, but when the whole sentence is full of new ones, gathering from context isn't so easy.One would suppose perhaps that most teens do not speak on these levels of intellect and vocab, but I can recall quite a few conversations from my junior high and high school years (over 10 years ago) in these same circle of words and thoughts. One must also consider that these teens would gravitate toward those places due to their being terminal as well.The one thing I really did not like more than the vocab, was the incessant run-on thoughts and sentences. While it did bring personality to the characters and sometimes even my own thought processes, writing endlessly like it drove me crazy. It's only difficult because it isn't what we are used to reading. It was a unique perspective though.The plot is beautiful. It truly is. Amidst the inevitable deaths coming, these teens face their lives and juice every drop they're able to. They made me reflect on my own; am I really taking for granted my health? I have known children personally who have lost their fights to Cancer. This book is extremely personal to me.I also can relate in one more aspect: the not being able to breathe one. I am an otherwise healthy individual, but rely heavily on my daily inhaler for Asthma. If I do not take it, I certainly feel it. At the beginning diagnosis, I was tested for allergies but had none. I was getting Bronchitis more than 3 times a year which is a hallmark sign of conditions like COPD and a terminal one called Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency. Every time I watched someone light up a cigarette, I wanted to punch them. Here I am, longing to run without having an asthma attack every time... wanting to walk up stairs without pain and passing out... I hated my lungs. I still do. No matter how strong I try to make them, they refuse to function without a faithful 440mg of meds per day. The ending diagnosis was not a chemical fallout at all, but more so an anatomical imperfection.The ostea in my nose are too small so when the barometric pressure in the air shifts, this creates even more pressure in everyone's sinuses. Since mine cannot properly drain, I get a lot of backup or it's a residual, slow dripping that I don't know is happening. I never get a runny nose. I carry a constant cough and rattle in my lungs, but without the inhaler, the cough grows drastically and almost immediately I am at my body's mercy.Before ruling out the above two diseases, I was terrified. I was 24 years old- I still had life to live... I WANTED to live and put everything I had into every day I had. I had a new relationship that I was pretty confident in (and that 2 and a half years I married). I had to prepare myself for potentially terminal news. Alpha-1 is generally a 5-10 year life span after diagnosis, COPD being a variance. Mind you, I am not a smoker nor have I ever been. I've always been athletic and food-conscious. I was looking at my life differently. If I had Alpha-1, it meant a slow digression of my lungs and injections to suffice my body. I would deteriorate beneath myself and be dead within 10 years most likely. Endless treatments... loosing my life... I began looking at the bigger picture. Why am I here? Is what I'm already aiming to reach, what I'm supposed to be aiming for? What legacy would I leave? Would I ever be a Mama? A wife?I could not imagine facing death at any younger of an age, let alone like these characters do. I truly believe this book is not for the faint of heart, but for those who are open-minded and easy to relate to."
5," Let me tell you how I started reading this book. I saw that it was going to be a movie and I liked the main character so I decided to give the book a shot. Before I read the book I watched the trailer. It looked like an OKAY movie but I still went through to read the book. I am so glad that I read the book!It begins with Hazel Grace. She is surviving with cancer. Her lungs are filled with tiny little masses that make it hard for her to breathe without her oxygen tank. She is forced to go to weekly meetings at a church with cancer patients. That is where she meets Augustus Waters. I think it is love at first sight. She makes him read one of her favourite books and he makes her read his. Their relationship grows and he uses his cancer wish to take Hazel to Amsterdam to meet the author of her favourite book. She has some unanswered questions for him about the book. Ever since they met, Augustus did not hide his feelings from her. He knew he loved her in an instant and wouldn’t give up on her, even though she kept pushing him away saying she was a grenade. He didn’t care. I loved the ending. Don’t worry, I won’t ruin it. That is all I will tell you.I know it doesn’t sound like much, and it really isn’t. There is nothing special about this book. The last chapter I read, though, for some odd reason, I couldn’t stop crying. The last chapter was a letter that Augustus wrote to the author. I just love it when guys show emotion. After I composed myself from crying during the last pages, I watched the trailer and cried even more! I felt a connection with the characters that you just don’t get when you watch a movie. This just proves that you will never get out of a movie when you get from a book. I definitely recommend this book. It isn’t even that long! Favourite line – Okay, Okay."
5," recommend The Fault in Our Stars for ages 13 and up. The Fault in Our Stars is a really great book because the author John Green adds so much detail and some much emotion. The genre of this book is nonfiction because this story is not real but it could happen. The Fault in Our Stars is a book about a 17 year old girl named Hazel Grace Lancaster that goes to a support group because she has cancer and in support group she meets 18 year old Augustus Waters. Augustus and Hazel form a relationship, and go on a trip together to Amsterdam with Hazel’s mom. When they go to Amsterdam Hazel gets to meet the author of her favorite book called an imperial Affliction by Peter Van Houten. When Augustus and Hazel get to Amsterdam, the next day they go to Peter Van Houten’s house to get answers to questions she has about the book. After they went to his house, Van Houten’s  assistant  Lidewij Vliegethart  offers them to go to the Anne Frank house. The next day they went back to Amsterdam. Hazel ad Gus plan to spend the rest of their lives together but something happens. If you want to find out read the book!!!The most important thing I learned from the book is that People have to go through tough times in their lives but you just have to get past the tough times. For example Hazel at first was going to die when she was 12 her parents said you can let go Hazel. But she ended up living. And in one part of the book Augustus was at the gas Station and the tube in Augustus’s stomach got infected ,Gus almost died, so the most important thing I learned that people go through tough times but get through them. I give this books Stars. I recommend. This book for ages 13 and up. I recommend this book because it is a really great book because it has so much emotion and so much great detail in the book it feels like you can feel the characters emotions. That’s why I give this book 5 Stars I and that’s why I recommend this book. Look what others say about my book:• The best book I’ve read in years• Beautiful.• . Young Adult Fiction at its finestAbout the author: John Michael Green is an American author of young adult fiction, YouTube video blogger, historian and creator of online educational videos.

4," Now this is a book that I may not have chosen to read if I hadn't seen all of the wonderful reviews about it. The reviews made me extremely curious about the book so I decided to see what the fuss was all about, especially as there is a film coming out based on the book. What I found was a book so life-affirming it's incredible!The book is revolves around Hazel and her battle with terminal cancer, she's going to die eventually and she knows it. You go into he book with certain preconceptions about it, beliefs in what you think are going to happen...... POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT!You think this is a book about DEATH, it's about a girl dying from cancer..... this is true it is a book with Death in it but I wouldn't say its a book about Death, it's actually a book about LIFE in my opinion. Hazel knows her time in limited and while you go through the book initially believing you will be reading about her loved one watching her die this turns out to simply not be the case. I think it's about Hazel getting some semblance of her life back as when the book begins her mother has been keeping her close to keep her well and safe but is in fact stifling Hazel to a degree, Hazel doesn't really have much of a life outside of the cancer and away from her family. It's understandable as Hazel#s parent have no idea how long they will have left with her and want to spend every moment possible with her but Hazel needs to have a life of her own to enjoy while she can and this is where the wonderful Gus comes in. Gus, a former cancer patient in remission, is breath of fresh air for Hazel and the sparks are instant. As the relationship between them develops Hazel begins to live her life again and it's a joy to read about until the moment that the big twist in the tale rears it's head and the book gets turned around completely.As I said, you think you'll be reading about Hazel's nearest and dearest watching her die despite the new lease of life she gains but the tables are turned and, without giving the twist away, it's heartbreaking reading.The book is very thought-provoking and makes you question whether you yourself are living your own life to the fullest extent possible while you can. The tale itself is tragically heartbreaking but so thoughtfully written with a certain flair that makes for easy reading combined with full force emotional impact. You think you know the sort of book you're getting until about 2/3 of the way through when the rug gets pulled straight out from under you, the emotional roller-coaster you find yourself on for the rest of book is astonishingly fantastic and doesn't let you go until the very end.Simply put this books is truly a work of art, it's beautiful, tragic and heartbreaking but one I would recommend to anyone who has the heart to read it!"
5," seriously did not know what I was getting myself into when I chose to read The Fault in Our Stars. I had no prior knowledge of it, nor had I heard of it; in fact, I purposely bought the book and chose to read it simply because it was on my reading list of “Book to Movies Challenge,” and since the movie is coming out in June, I figured I’d better hurry. Together with that, I seriously did not know what I was getting myself into when I chose to read The Fault in Our Stars until I read the first chapter in its entirety and realized that the rest of book was going to:(a) Be flooded with profanity at the turn of every page(b) Utterly insult the deity of the God I believe in because within the first paragraphs of chapter one, I was lead to, “The Literal Heart of Jesus” with extreme sarcasm if I may add ;)Now, I ought to admit that I was offended at first within the very first chapter of The Fault in Our Stars, but at the same time, I was genuinely captivated because well let’s face it, John Green has a charm with words. He is like one of those polished jugglers, who make such a simple trick look so easy when in reality it is not.So I read on, and on, chapter after chapter, I submersed myself into the most fascinating life of Hazel Grace Lancaster, and then something remarkable happened. It was as if, this guarded bubble I had been living in most of my life, suddenly popped! Ha! Yeah crazy right!? It’s like, I came to understand and discover a world completely different from the one I've been so settled in. Please do not misread what I am trying to convey; I am not declaring that I have completely tossed everything I've known to be true out the window. No, I am not denying my faith in Jesus or any foundation I have established in my faith. What I mean to say is that, I discovered that there are such intriguing and beautiful people outside of my inner circle and I want to get to know them. Most importantly, I wish to in no way approach them with a mission or my religious stake either; I just simply want to know them and listen to their story. :)I wonder if the most extraordinary people on our planet are taken so suddenly from family and loved ones because they deserve something better than to continue to live amongst immature, half-grown human beings. I really do not wish to insult anyone or to single anyone out; really I don’t. These were just some first thoughts that crossed my mind after I finished reading The Fault in Our Stars. Like, what if God takes these extraordinary people to Him on such short notice, because they miraculously have understood the meaning of existence?What if everyone (myself included) who is still alive on earth today, right now; what if, we are still existent because we have a great deal to learn, a great deal to understand, to go through in order to acknowledge and appreciate life’s existence…and that of Gods. It’s no wonder death arrives at the end of one’s life. I imagine that is when all of life’s lessons finally make sense, but then it is too late to go back and fix the mistakes and choices we made.I found myself cloaked in guilt and shame after I came to the end of Hazel Grace’s story. My shirt was literally soaked in snot and tears. Though Hazel Grace Lancaster and Augustus Waters are fictional characters, I couldn't help but consider that there could very well possibly be many sixteen year old girls battling lung tumors today; struggling to breathe and survive just one more day. I felt terrible shame for taking my health and that of my children and my Ben’s for granted. I especially felt great guilt for not appreciating what I have been given; changes will be made.To finish, we are all dying of a terminal illness…the illness is sin, whose side effect is death."
5," Only a few people can make humor out of a touchy subject. Hardly anyone can pump large amounts of humor into a book that WILL make you cry. John Green does both, placing numerous profound little quotes and metaphors while he's at it. Probably what I like most about this book: it's down to earth. Nothing in this book really stands out to me as too extreme in one direction or the other. There aren't any overly happy moments that last very long without any dark undertone (SPOILER: such as the duo's time in Amsterdam), and any dark moments usually contain some form of humor, with a few exceptions (SPOILER: like Augustus's death).This book is just a good balance, in my opinion. It has the power to evoke many emotions I don’t normally feel while reading a book. I felt uneasy while laughing, hopeful during sadness, and fearful while happy. This book gave me insight on a subject I haven’t experienced (and hope no one would ever experience): having your own death hung above your head. The book inside of The Fault in our Stars, An Imperial Affliction, is, from what I understand, a perfect representation of The Fault in our Stars, giving a good peek inside the mind of a cancer patient that should and would much rather be dead.However, nothing is perfect. As many others have noticed, both Hazel and Gus use extremely complex language, language that no one I've met can use to half the extent that this book does. When you read the following example, keep in mind that these are teenagers, people.“There will come a time when all of us are dead. All of us. There will come a time when there are no human beings remaining to remember that anyone ever existed or that our species ever did anything. There will be no one left to remember Aristotle or Cleopatra, let alone you. Everything that we did and built and wrote and thought and discovered will be forgotten and all of this will have been for naught. Maybe that time is coming soon and maybe it is millions of years away, but even if we survive the collapse of our sun, we will not survive forever. There was time before organisms experienced consciousness, and there will be time after. And if the inevitability of human oblivion worries you, I encourage you to ignore it. God knows that’s what everyone else does.”Hazel, our main character, says this fairly early on. She says this whole paragraph without thinking twice or anything. All on a whim. I might be able to accept that illness had aged our main characters to the Shakespearean level of speech they possess if they had lived a few more years with it. However, as it is, I find the idea of two teenagers who open their mouths and vomit out some well-refined monologue or profound insight that looks like it was worked on for days unrealistic.Overall, I think this is a great book that you should definitely read. It stays down to earth while being very funny, very sad, and very happy . However, the way the characters speak and act is a tad unrealistic, using large, spontaneous monologues and other, extremely refined ways of speaking that doesn’t mesh well with the fact that the main characters are meant to be teenagers. However good this book is, I do not think this book is all stars and has no faults."
2," The Fault in our Stars is a love story of two cancer struck teenagers. The author, John Green, tells this story through the eyes and mind of the main character, Hazel Grace. John Green got inspiration for the title of the book from Act 1 Scene 2 of Shakespeare’s play Julius Caesar. “The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves, that we are underlings.” The genre of “The Fault in our Stars” is realistic fiction and geared towards young adults but enjoyed by many ages. It was recently turned into a movie with the same name filmed by Josh Boone. TFIOS is the winner of the 2013 Children’s Choice Teen Book award. It was named TIME magazines #1 Fiction Book of the year on June 6th, 2014, a feature film adaption that was released and earned over $300 million in box office sales. Also, TFIOS won many Teen Choice Awards in 2014. The Fault in our Stars was a book that let me wanting more. I wanted to know more about the book after the ending. I wanted to know what happened with Hazel’s family. The book was well-written and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I just wish it was a more strung out plot. Moreover, on Amazon book reviews surviver_15 said “I think it is very well written. It covers a topic that is difficult to talk about and is often avoided” While scrolling through all the reviews I see several topics having their titles be, “The Best Book I’ve Read in Years”, or “Young Adult Fiction at its Finest.” In addition, on Amazon book review Helen said, “TFIOS is a word that defies its genre in all the best ways. The silly boy crushes and superficial gossip that writers think makes up 99% of high school steps aside for a beautiful, honest, heartrending story of life, death, and love. I can only compare this book to Markus Zuzak’s award-winning “The Book Thief” in terms of sophistication and depth.” Coming from one of our own Trumbull High School fellow classmates, Lily Clark also states, “This book was inspiring and heartwarming. It taught me to love my life and not take anything for granted.” In my opinion, the trip to meet Van Houten was the best part of the book. John Green described Amsterdam in a way where I could imagine the romantic dinner at the restaurant Oranjee and the canal ridden streets. The detail in which they described the suffering of Augustus Waters throughout the book was articulate and gave me an elaborate mental visualization of him. It was almost as if I could hear their voices in my head and I could feel their sadness. Looking at all these quotes from people I can definitely tell they agreed on how they felt about this book. So let’s talk about what this book is really about. TFIOS is a love story about two stage 4 cancer teenagers. Hazel Grace is a shy thyroid cancer stuck 16 year old girl. When her mom makes her go to a support group, she takes special interest in a 17 year old ex-basketball star who happens to be an amputee. Hazel recommends Gus to read, “An Imperical Affliction” which becomes the epitome of their relationship. After finishing the book, Gus reveals that he had been in touch with the author of the book and had been offered a meeting with him. After medical restriction problems and parent persuasion, they took a trip with Hazels mother to Amsterdam to meet the infamous Van Houten. After meeting with the drunken genius, Hazel loses interest in finding out “What happens next.” In this book on this romance filled trip, Gus tells Hazel his cancer has returned and he was in fact dying. When they return home Gus’s sickness worsens rapidly. Now I don’t want to give too much away but let’s just say you get that feeling of not wanting to put the book down, but also need a break from reading this heartwarming book. Most importantly, you can’t be afraid to let a few tears go. On the website theguardian.com Milo agrees by saying, “It enthralls, entertains, and educates and offers a jumping off point for young people to explore and discuss important philosophical issues. And yes, I did get something in my eye at the end. But it was only dust.’” The author did a great job of allowing us to feel different emotion throughout the book. At times it was hard to read, but I guess that’s what you should expect when reading at times romantic and funny, but at the sad time heart wrenching and heart breaking. John Green receives a question asking, “Did the themes and ideas from stories you had abandoned in the past help shape TFIOS?” He replied, “Yes , in a lot of ways. There are many lines from the sequel and the desert island book that ended up in TFIOS in different ways. John Green also adds, The desert island book was primarily about how we behave around each other when we are scared, how fear makes us both more and less human…..But then I ended up including a lot of metrification in TFIOS, so it founds its way in as well.” Concluding,  if you have read some of his other book for instance, Paper Towns (2008), Will Grayson, Will Grayson (2010), as well as some short stories “Reasons” What you wish for (2011) or most recently, “Double on Call and other Short Stories (2012), the TFIOS is definitely the book for you. Overall, I wouldn’t hesitate to pick this book up and experience the feelings most of us felt during this movies, and I hope you leave off feeling the way I did."
4," When I first picked up The Fault in Our Stars, I wasn’t sure what to expect. Would it be a tale of romance? Of hardship? Of the inevitability of our own demise? I learned after ravenously reading this John Green masterpiece that this novel was all three, and more. The story focuses on Hazel Grace Lancaster, a 16-year-old thyroid cancer survivor who is not sure what to do with her life. The aggressive nature of her cancer leads her doctors to believe that she will not live more than a few more years. It is only due to the miracle drug “Phlanxifor” (a fictional medicine created by Green) that her life has been extended as long as it has. On a trip to a support group meeting for cancer survivors, however, Hazel’s life takes a drastic turn; she meets Augustus “Gus” Waters, a handsome 17 year old amputee and osteosarcoma survivor, who teaches her there’s more to life than just postponing death.The book has its fair share of twists, turns, and surprises. Green’s unique sense of humor helps to inject comedy into otherwise dreary and depressing situations, keeping the novel’s tone as light as one could hope from a book about cancer survivors. But the novel isn't predominantly about cancer. In fact, there’s not very much about cancer at all. The book is about Hazel’s and Gus’s romance and how they fall in love regardless of their fates. They defy their situations, and make the most of their time together. As Gus said, “Almost everyone is obsessed with leaving a mark upon the world. Bequeathing a legacy. Outlasting death” (310). Hazel and Gus choose to leave a legacy behind in each other. When one of them dies, they will live on in the other’s memories. That’s what I think the real message of the book is. We all want to live forever. We all want to be remembered. We don’t need to be a famous movie star, novelist, or musician, to do that. To be remembered after we pass, we just need to live on in the memories of our family and friends. And that’s enough.Despite the novel’s heavy topic, The Fault in Our Stars is a brilliant novel, filled with humor, wit, and a thought-provoking message. I’d recommend the novel to anyone, and advocate that it is a must-read for anyone of any age."
5," The Fault in Our Stars, as awful and horribly sad as it might sound, leaves no happy emotions out of its list for readers on its mental roller coaster. John Green, the author of the teen tragic comedy, utilizes Hazel Grace's voice to inject some of his own personality and humor into the seemingly depressing life of a far-gone cancer patient while still keeping the underlying premise of the gravity of Hazel's situation. The clarity of which Green executes his bursts of humor makes it easy to understand and universal for all readers of all ages.  A prime example of Green's light-heartedness is in the exposition and of course through the voice of Hazel when she listened to Patrick recount for the thousandth time his depressingly miserable life story--how he had cancer in his balls and they thought he was going to die but he didn't die and here he is, a full-grown adult in a church basement in the 137th nicest city in America, divorced, addicted to video games, mostly friendless, eking out a meager living by exploiting his cancertastic past, slowly working his way toward a master's degree that will not improve his career prospects, waiting, as we all do, for the sword of Damocles to give him the relief that he escaped lo those many years ago when cancer took both of his nuts but spared what only the most generous soul would call his life. That is hilarious. The type of dry, hilarious humor that Green adds makes his story weigh a little less, yet in the entire above quote, the underlying theme of living life to the fullest and narrowly escaping death stubbornly remains: another reason why The Fault in Our Stars blows me away.  Throughout all of the laughs and the upbeat moments, sprinkled in every once and a while with a little saltshaker of pain were some very cancer moments. At the end of the story, though, whoever was holding the shaker unscrewed the cap and poured on the sadness like it was payday. But oddly enough, the better sense of realism made the story better. I can't really even imagine the book being solely funny; I don't think there's ever even been a funny book about cancer before this. Regardless, the sprinkled and poured moments of depressing cancer moments added a much needed weight to the story.  To put it briefly, this book was amazing. I was fascinated that the author could blend two such different genres as saddening dramas and teen heart-felt comedies into one hilariously heartbreaking story of young love. For the simple reason that John Green is a genius at fabricating a book out of two genres as different as steel and ground beef while still keeping an emotional weight to the story, everyone needs to read this book. I advocate the suggestion of this book to anyone who enjoys the triumphs of life and the freedom of laughter."
5," You don't always get what you want in life. The Fault in our Stars is a story about falling in love while fighting cancer. This is a book that all teens can relate to. The ups and downs of life are very obvious, and Hazel's journey is evidence of this. She has cancer, she feels frustrated and angry at the world. She goes to a support for cancer patients and meets Gus, a fellow teen who is also fighting cancer. Gus has a positive outlook, determined to see life as a party meant to be enjoyed while you can. He becomes friends with Hazel, and encourages her let go and have fun despite her having cancer. Together, they travel to Amsterdam on a trip that impacts Hazel in a significant way that made her story arc entertaining and interesting. Hazel's story arc is interesting and very easy for teens to relate to. The character of Gus was an out of the ordinary kind of guy who cared about life and who would be an appealing friend. His openness about his opinions, sense of humor and overall positive outlook on life held my interest throughout the story. Hazel is very real. Her outlook on life is negative, as you would expect from someone fighting cancer and living with the burden of being hooked up to an oxygen tank for part of her day, just to survive. She feels sorry for herself sometimes, thinks no one cares enough to try to understand how she feels. She behaves exactly how you would expect a teenager living with lung cancer to behave. As someone who lives with a disability, I related to her feelings of anger at the world, her situation and thinking no one could possibly understand. Anyone who goes through something like this knows herpain. I thought the setting and scenery described in the book was good, it drew me in big time! The language was a bit strong at times, but is real to how teens talk today. Overall, great story!"
5," tend to be somewhat late to reading books that are massive pop culture phenomena because of the large backlog of works I read on a regular basis, and admittedly reading this sort of romance is not something I do often, and for good reason. I really hate reading books like this, not because the books are bad (because this book is actually very good) but I hate what books like this say about me. The characters in this novel are witty, cynical, romantic, clever, and are precisely the sort of people that I would be friends with. The fact that they are [spoiler alert] dying of cancer only makes their romance more poignant, their love more futile than the sort of futile romantic longings that most of us (myself definitely included) have to wrestle with over the course of our lives.This book is difficult to review because there are large parts of it that remind me all too much of my own past and present. One of the chief difficulties, for me, of reading a book like this is it reminds me that for all of my cynicism, I am a romantic at heart, something that causes no end of trouble in my life and in my interactions with others. Over and over again, the book reminds us that the two protagonists are in love, in a real love, with people who are awkward, who like serious books and think deeply about mortality and the meaning of life even as they face their own inexorable demise, and yet despite the fact that they know they are doomed, they still fall in love anyway, still open their hearts to someone else, still long for intimacy and connection in a world where those are immensely hazardous and very ill-rewarded for most of us. Most of the people who read this book will not have cancer, but most know what it is like to be gripped between fear and longing, and to choose to love even when it is inconvenient, even when it is doomed to produce immense stress and difficulty in our lives and the lives of others, because, as the author says towards the end, we do not have a choice to be hurt or not in this life, but rather we chose who we let hurt us.As is often the case with novels that strike a chord, this novel has achieved a great deal of success as a book and as a film (I have not yet seen the movie), and this success is well-earned. Not only has the author constructed two memorable and sympathetic romantic leads, but each of the secondary characters adds something to the plot as well, as well as to the struggle over fulfilling our longings for love and intimacy even if we know our lives on this earth are but a brief vapor leaving us to be forgotten and consigned to oblivion. Despite the fact that we are beings doomed to death and suffering and sorrow, heartbreak and pain and agony, we are driven by our longings to seek friendship and romantic love, to stare into the heavens to curse them or reflect on them, and to hope against hope that we have lived a life worth remembering by someone, if only for a little while. Clearly that longing for love, for meaning, for significance, is a longing that drives many of us in our lives, and books like this serve to remind us of the intensity and universality of those longings, providing comfort only in the fact that we are all struggling against the same fate, and that we are all at least potential friends and allies in the struggle against despair. As a book that combines humane storytelling with witty references to literature and pop culture, this is a book that is a treat for both the head and the heart, a book that traffics in heartbreak even as it provokes the longings it deals with so grimly and so realistically."
4," One of the ironies of my life is that as a child, I often read books written for adults but now that I am an adult, I often read books written for children. Yet John Green, the exceptional author of The Fault in Our Stars wrote a masterful novel that touches adults as well as adolescents. I believe the chief reason he seems to have targeted adolescents as the audience for his book is simply that many Americans will stop reading novels after graduating high school. If that is negative, it is negative for reasons that are beyond the power of any one author.One of the phrases Green uses frequently in the novel is cancer perk. A cancer perk is a gift that a cancer patient receives that would not have been given if the person were healthy. An example is a trip to Disney World that a girl with leukemia gets for free because people are sympathetic to her plight. Until I read this novel, I thought such gifts were pleasant, compassionate gestures. But now I see something perhaps sinister, maybe even hypocritical about them. It's the futility of it that gets to me. It's like tickling a baby to get it to stop crying. The idea is that we think you're stupid so we're going to give you something that we believe makes people happy so you won't feel sad. But if you have a tumor in your lungs, no matter how many times you ride the tea cups, you'll still have the tumor.I don't know if anyone has explained the title, but it's quite clever. In the play Julius Caesar, Caesar says, The fault, dear Brutus, lies not in our stars, but in us. He means that men should not blame fate for their failures but look to their own shortcomings. John Green turns that idea on its head by showing powerful examples of people who have done little that we would call wrong, yet they suffer anyway just because that is the kind of universe we inhabit. I'm not as cynical as Green is on this issue, but I recognize that the problem of evil is a thorny issue that does not yield to easy answers. If I am being honest, I don't think I could formulate a cogent response to a 17 year old girl who asks, What did I do to deserve this cancer in my body? In a general sense, I can say that pain has a useful function in nature because it tends to motivate organisms to doing healthy things and avoiding harmful things. In a religious vein, I might say, this is not the world we were made for, but it is merely a testing ground for a life to come. If people suffer here, they will be recompensed in the next world with joy. If people cause others to suffer here, they will be recompensed in the next world with pain. So if Hazel suffered here, maybe she will have an amazing time in heaven. Yet while she was on earth, she didn't know and she didn't believe that she would get anything for her suffering. And she didn't have any choice in the matter. If I'm being honest, I must say that strikes me, as at least unfair, and more likely, a situation of significant injustice.These are the questions this fine novel will put in your head. And it's also a fun ride, tinged with beauty, grace, and humor."
5," don't read cancer books. I don't like to think about death, which is perfectly normal. I'm more of a dystopian and vampiric fiction reader. But, THE FAULT IN OUR STARS isn't about death; it is about the process of dying. That makes all of the difference.My niece is watching a movie on her school iPad and asks me to join her. She is part-way through the film, but, at thirty-one, I still enjoy palling with teenage relatives. A few sodas, bag of Chex mix, and pile of tissues later, the credits are rolling. I am crying. She is crying. We are survivors, bitter-sweet as it is to have loved and lost to cancer...again. It was just like real-life: my mother, her aunt, two years ago this month. So, of course I have to read the Jonathan Green's book too.A FAULT IN OUR STARS is not about death. It is about how to die, which, if you think about it, is really about how to live your best life while you still have the chance to live it. That is the battle for Hazel, Gus, and Isaac. The three bond in and out of a support group for depressed teenagers in the stages of cancer. Hazel has lung cancer. Gus has bone cancer. Isaac has a rare eye cancer. While they live, each discovers in herself capacities for wit, wisdom, flirtation, aggression, sacrifice, love, and individuality, partly because walking hand-in-hand with shadows gave them the courage or means or freedom to do today what may not be able to be done  tomorrow.Writing this novel from a YA perspective focused the emotional content. An older narrator would be reflecting upon her first kiss, graduation, marriage, and child's first steps, while Hazel is still striving to make these memories. Hazel has just recently met her favorite book - the book which surpasses all others - and is terrified of not being alive to read its sequel. The concentration on dating takes cancer out of the hospital and hospice sick-room, into the everyday. Cancer patients exhibit feelings about their illness, but the author never lets readers forget that they hold opinions, fears, and emotions related to commonplace stresses - school, family, friends, money, etc. Cancer patients are still human beings, not identifiable only as their condition.But the youthfulness of the narrator and her friends does not disallow deeper subject matter into THE FAULT IN OUR STARS. One topic under frequent discussion is evolution and how the fight to keep cancer patients alive goes against the emergence of the human species, propetuating our  side-effects, cancer patients as unhealthy mutations in the long-term survival battle of our species. Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs is debated. The author also  puts forward unsubtle parallels between Anne Frank, the main character of Hazel's favorite book, and Hazel herself. Opening these discussions does not disrespect cancer victims, but helps to air their feelings of being grnades'' in the lives of those around them and brings to light some of the darker faults of an inbittered spirit drawning in fear.There are many ways to die. Quietly and peacefully in the bed without pain is rare. Author Jonathan Green is realistic about cancer's effects without asserting its more morbid aspects. Somehow, he takes a novel on star-crossed love and creates the most triumphant heartache from fictional sorrow. Green shows ultimate respect for cancer patients and their caregivers through his realistic attitude.Cancer is a fight. Battle is brutal. Not everyone goes quietly into their good-night.* * * * * * * * * * * * *Quotes from THE FAULT IN OUR STARS:Chapter 2:I liked Augustus Waters. I really, really, really liked him. I liked the way his story ended with someone else. I liked his voice. I liked that he took existentially-fraught free-throws. I liked that he was a tendered professor in the department of slightly crocked smiles with a duel appointment in the department of having a voice of making my skin feel more like skin.And I liked that he had two names. I've always liked people with two names, because you get to make up your mind what you call them- Gus or Augustus. Me, I was always just Hazel. Univalent Hazel.Chapter 2:I guess I had been looking toward the encouragement above the TV, a drawing of an angel with the caption, Without pain, how could we know joy? This is an old argument in the field of thinking about suffering, and its stupidity and lack of safistication could be plumbed for centuries, but sufficed to say that the existance of broccoli does not in any way affect the taste of chocolate.Chapter 5:But I believe in true love, you know. I don't believe that everybody gets to keep their eyes or not get sick or whatever, but everybody should have true love, and it should last at least as long as your life does. (Gus)Chapter 6:We all miss you so much. It just never ends. It feels like we were all wounded in your battle, Caroline. FacebookChapter 21:The pleasure of remembering had been taken from me, because there was no longer anyone to remember with. It felt like losing your co-remember meant losing the memory itself, as if the things we'd done were less real and important than they had been hours before.* * * * * * * * * * * * *In memory of Joyce T.

5," What did I think? Huh. Well, it was what I expected, but not. It definitely wasn't an easy mindless read. Which I wasn't expecting it to be, but it was much more cerebral and heavy than I had expected. I didn't expect the Peter Van Houten/book element, which I thought was interesting. About halfway through, I figured that Augustus would have a reoccurrence of cancer, but I didn't expect him to go down so fast and die (which were so sad and hard to “watch” happening). I obviously figured it would be Hazel who would die, and I think he left her “ending” unresolved the way Van Houten did with Anna in his book. Clever. I don't know....I've just got so many thoughts running through my mind about this book, that I don't really know what to say or where to start. So I guess I'll just write down the things that are going through my mind and hope it will make since in the end. :-)I’m surprised that I have so many connections to this book. The first is the obvious. Cancer. When I was going through all my breast cancer stuff a year and a half ago, after I had my double mastectomy, they first told me that I had an 80% chance of NOT having a reoccurrence, and then changed it to 98% of NOT having a reoccurrence. Both percentages are REALLY good, but then (and sometimes now) I would think about the 2% - 20% chance that it COULD come back. That’s not a good place for your mind to go; therefore, I really don’t think about it much anymore. This is where the frightening connection to Augustus comes in. He had the same 80% chance of NOT having a reoccurrence of cancer, and yet, it came back with a vengeance and claimed his life quickly. I am getting closer and closer to the 2-year post diagnosis mark. My cancer had the potential of being very aggressive; and something would have come up sooner rather than later if I were to have a reoccurrence. So every week, month, and year that goes by, the more certain I feel that I will be fine, and November 16th, 2012 was the last day cancer was, and will be, in my body. ☺Ok, back to the book. I have known about the author John Green for a while, and have wanted to read his books, but it was SO COOL to find out that he is from Indianapolis (where I’m from). Even cooler was the fact that this book takes place in Indianapolis around all the places that I know. The “Funky Bones” thing that they talk about in the book is at the Indianapolis Art Museum. It is really cool, and I took my boys their last summer and they had a so much fun playing on the bones and jumping back and forth between them. They also had a blast climbing the basketball “exhibit” that has big arches showing where basketballs could have bounced. This is also mentioned in the book. A very unexpected connection to this book is with the author. I was completely surprised to find out that someone that I grew up with, and our families have been good friends for what seems like forever, is friends with John Green. I guess they’re not just acquaintances, but they live close to each other and are very close friends. What?!?! This is where I got a little “fangirl”, because let’s face it, in my world right now, the authors I read are celebrities to me! Yes, it’s sad but true. :"
5," The critically acclaimed novel, “Fault in our Stars” written by John Green has become one of my personal favorite books to read. I highly recommend this novel to those of all ages because I think this story will become a classic throughout time. Many can say that the novel resembles the similar plot of a typical love story, however, in my opinion I feel that it is held highest above all the rest. Not because it has a catchy title or because it was turned into a major motion picture (which is very good and I highly recommend the movie as well) but because to me the novel perfectly illustrates a TRUE romance. The novel is told in first person narrative by the main character Hazel Grace Lancaster, who is sixteen years old and has terminal thyroid cancer. One day when Hazel goes to here cancer support group she meets a young boy named Augustus Waters, who is seventeen years old and is a recent survivor of a bone tumor in his leg by partially amputating it. This is the bases of our story, where both their friendship and love begin. Hazel and Augustus have clashing perspectives on life and love. Hazel feels that she should be left alone in her despair where she can’t hurt her parents or anyone with her illness. Augustus on the other hand wants to embrace life to the fullest, and through his amazing life he will be immortalize and remembered forever. So there are our two opposing perspectives, one who wants to be remembered and one who wants to be forgotten. However in the mist of all that is going on in Hazel’s life she discovers a connection with Augustus that really helps free her from her own self imprisonment. And together, both Hazel and Augustus discover a new perspective on life and love through each other. Why I say this is not a typical love story but rather a true romance? It is because the love between these two characters is not created by clique experiences where they look into each other’s eyes and fall in love. It is created by brokenness, both of these characters are broken and lost in one way or another. They find ways to help one another heal and grow, and through this they fall in love. They learn that they are not label by their weaknesses and discover happiness bitter circumstances. This story is a true romance because it illustrates the way people are meant to love, to overcome things in life, and the way they are meant to discover themselves. The novel illustrates that thins we love and the people we love sometimes come with hard situations but we love them nonetheless. I think that’s why it’s titled “Fault in our Stars” because the fault is that we can only see the stars when we’re in darkness, but that unfortunate fact does not diminish our love for them. We still love and we still shine even with our faults. We learn to look up and see the light of the stars even in our darkest nights."
5," had been wanting to read this book since it appeared every time among the most favorites in the pop-ups of various e-commerce sites. It has also been read by at least a quarter readers out there and at least five people in my Goodreads friends list. I was previously not too keen thinking this book as just another from Young Adult Love genre with a very tragic end. I finally made up my mind and began reading it and realized my prejudice completely shattered. This book has also won the Goodreads Choice Award in the category Young Adult Fiction in 2012(OK,  Now I HAD to read it).The narration in the book is by the sixteen year old protagonist Hazel Grace who is suffering from thyroid cancer which has spread to her lungs. She is kinda witty and very normal and not too much of an ideal girl as they sometimes portray in those Mills and Boon series. She attends a support group for cancer patient where she meets Augustus Waters who also supports from osteosarcoma due to which one of his legs is removed and thus their bonding gets strengthened when he invites her home after the support group meeting for a movie where he thinks Hazel resembles the actress in the movie. Subsequently they keep meeting and thus their relationship begins and the reader never realizes how their acquaintance turns to relationship.The book conversations and the video game sessions between Hazel and Gus(this is how he is referred most of the places) are their main relationship boosters and this is further strengthened when Gus gives fulfills Hazel’s wish of questioning the author of An Imperial Affliction which is her most favorite book about its incomplete end and the characters in the book. She also undergoes her first date, first kiss and first love during this trip and they realize their true love for each other.However my most favorite character in the book remains Hazel’s mother who is constantly caring for her daughter never once feeling saddened or cribbing and finally deciding to move on with her career whilst caring for her daughter which is mentioned at the end of the book. Many conversations and quotes in the book are quite philosophical and for the thoughts alone I’m giving 3 stars out of 5.This book never talks of the sad ending or about deaths and tragedy but reflects on surpassing all of that and talks more of living. Another one star for this. There are a lot of references to moving on and rays of hope and that is what makes this book very different from the other ones which talk of the sad things related to cancer. I would give it a 4/5 and to those who have refrained from reading this book due to the genre its associated with, its definitely worth a try.Rating: 4/5(Philosophically Good)"
2,"magine reading, your eyes getting teary, and never wanting to put the book down because it’s just too good. The Fault in Our Stars by John Green is a wonderful novel about a teenage girl, Hazel Grace, who has been diagnosed with cancer and a boy Augustus Waters, who also has cancer. I recommend this book because it is full of life and a great story. The author tried to create a book about not being afraid of dying and living life to the fullest and I believe John Green accomplished that. Hazel Grace Lancaster is an 18 year old girl diagnosed with thyroid cancer that made fluid go into her lungs. Throughout the book, Hazel is always struggling from her cancer, which results in her being depressed and always feeling like she’s dying. While attending a social event, she meets Augustus Water. Augustus Waters had cancer in his leg and had to have it amputated. After the event, Hazel and Augustus hang out and they both realize they like each other. They end up going to many places with each other; Amsterdam, on picnics, and even Hazel’s backyard. The end of the book results in a very surprising ending.The character Hazel is intelligent, kind, and very likeable. In addition, she is a main character. At the beginning of the book, she seems very shy. During the story, Hazel gradually starts to become more and more independent and more confident with herself. By the end of the book, Hazel is mature and overcomes her fear of rejection. I connected with Hazel throughout the book. The way the author described her loneliness at the beginning of the book helped me visualize her situation as a cancer patient.Augustus Waters begins as a very open-minded, nice, and pleasant character. He is also one of the main characters. In the middle of the book, he realizes his love for Hazel. He is very charming towards her and very likeable. I connected with Augustus as well as Hazel after they met. The way the author described their relationship helped me visualize the connection between them.John Green created a suspenseful mood along with a happy tone. The settings were suspenseful, enjoyable, and thrilling. Some of the parts had me unsure of what was happening and it made it very suspenseful. Other times is would make me so happy and I enjoyed what was going on. In addition, the word choice is brilliant and makes it very easy to visualize.In conclusion, I recommend this book for teenage girls. Anyone who is interested in a love story, a sad story, or a good book will enjoy this novel by John Green. This book made me happy, sad, and thrilled while reading it and is worth looking at."
4," can’t believe it took me this long to read this amazing book. Well, partly because of how sad it was and I already knew how it was going to end (got spoiled). But nonetheless, I absolutely loved this book to pieces and finished it the day before the movie came out. Bawled my eyes out while reading (which was hard not to completely drown in my tears, I was babysitting and didn’t want to wake the baby). I bawled again (even harder) while watching the movie. I’m so glad I hosted a read-a-long to this book, because knowing myself, I would have pushed it off even more just because of how sad this book is. I usually don’t make myself read sad books. I’m a very emotional person so it doesn’t take much for tears to start forming in my eyes. I’m such a baby, but oh well.I just adored John Green’s writing style and how easy it was to fall into Hazel’s head and completely imagine what was going on. Even while watching the movie, it felt as if it was a reality TV show or something so real! I adore Hazel and Augustus’ relationship. Everything about this book honestly was amazing. I knew going into the book that I would absolutely adore it, no question. I knew that. It was the tears and sadness that kept pushing me away from reading. I surprisingly didn’t have a hard time picking up another book, which I thought was going to cause a problem after reading. Possibly cause a reading slump, but no, thankfully I had no problems picking up another book!I definitely cannot wait to read more of John Green’s books! His writing style is definitely amazing and so perfect, and I’m hoping that his others will be just as good! I have never marked a book this much in my life (I use post-it flags to mark favorite places). I have maybe around 25+ flags in the book! So with that said, there will be A LOT of favorite quotes!"
5," One of the surest ways for dissapointment is high hopes. This was the biggest fault I found in The Fault in our Stars. I had been hearing about the book (and movie) and how amazing it is for over a year before I finally got my hands on a copy. While I enjoyed reading it, it didn't give me the happy spark many of my favorite books gave me. As I was pondering some of the big draws to the book (the romance, the trip) I thought about if those things would still have engaged me without the terminal illness, and the answer was no. Therefore, I rated this book at 2.75 stars (maybe even 2.5 at my grumpiest/most cynical).Now, before you get all huffy, I realize this is a book about teens with cancer. I also realize that there are far too many teens with cancer out there living similar lives to the characters in the book (if only less grand). However, like Hazel muses about over and over in the book, just because you live doesn't mean that the universe owes you an extraordinary story or impact. I actually liked the parts that were more cancer-focused (rather than plot focused) like the scene toward the end of the book when Hazel realizes she was the healthiest person in the room. Or the purely teenagery parts when she steals off to a corner of a mall to get away from the friend she had faded away from AND her helicopter mom. Those were the most real, and the most enjoyable to me.The reason this book failed for me was the seemingly forced romance between Hazel and Gus. If this story were about two teens brought together because they were both injured in a car crash involving a drunk driver (or something like that) and were not terminally ill, the love story and description of its development would simply fall flat. It's as though people read terminally ill and immediately jump to finding one's soul mate/true love before anything else. Of course they fell in love, they both have cancer! Which is, quite simply, poor planning and a weak explanation.The other big negative for me was the unrealistic portrayal of the high school aged teens. What adult talks and thinks like that, let alone a teenager who hasn't been to school in three years and watched ANTM marathons? Not to say you need to go to school to be smart or to say there is anything wrong with watching junky TV, it just seems like Hazel was very isolated and would not have the opportunity to create such definitively held beliefs nor the ability to communicate them in a witty, funny way with people her age. Even Gus seemed to be a bit over the top in that regard. Every moment of their dialogue seemed forced and unrealistic to me.However, it was a quick and entertaining book. I can see why people enjoy it, I just don't see how it has gotten hyped up as one of the best romantic, or even cancer-centric, novels out there."
2," didn’t want to do it. I really didn’t. I resisted for a while and would have kept resisting, but one of my friends got a free copy from the publisher so I decided to read it. That’s right. I read The Fault in Our Starts. I read the book, which was the cause for me almost getting killed at BookCon (not really, but really it could have happened.)Now I have never read a John Green novel before. I have resisted doing so until now. This book has changed my mind about John Green. I would now like to go and read all of his books and make sure that I really do like his books. Many people have told me that The Fault in Our Stars is not his best book so I am excited about the idea that there is something better out there.Before you ask, no I haven’t seen the movie. Now I am going to. I was going to see the movie no matter what but now that I have read the book I really am going to see it.At the beginning I was a little doubtful. There were some words that I felt didn’t really fit. Example, she describes the main guy Gus as “dead sexy”. I don’t know if a 16 year old really thinks of guys as “dead sexy”.  Also she mentions that he makes her “skin feel more like skin” (pg. 31). “He kind of turned me on” (pg. 17). I did not like such descriptions. They seemed a little cheesy, but it may just because I am older and not a 15-year-old girl.I did really like Gus. I thought he was cute. He had some great qualities such as not trying to actually win video games, but save innocents/Hazel. He had some great lines and I did cry when he died.One thing I liked about this book was the mortality of the characters. There isn’t any focus on characters who don’t have cancer. Cancer seems like something you really don’t truly understand unless you have it, someone close to you has it or you know someone who has died of it. Cancer is this big scary thing that we really don’t understand and we really can’t even do anything about.It did take me a little while to get into the story, but I eventually got it. I might enjoy it more if I read it a second time, but I don’t know. I liked his style of writing. I thought there were some really great lines.“I want to minimize the number of deaths I am responsible for” (pg. 28).“You put the killing thing right between your teeth, but you don’t give it the power to do its killing” pg. 20H: “I’m trying to observe young love in its many splendor awkwardness”G: “Yes its difficult to ascertain whether he is trying to arouse her or perform a breast exam”  pg. 19Isaac: “Thank you for explaining that my eye cancer isn’t going to make me deaf” pg. 15One thing that I will harp on is the focus on V for Vendetta in this movie. Hazel is supposed to look like Natalie Portman in that movie. I accepted this, even liked it cause not many people can pull off the shaved head look as a girl and look good. Natalie Portman is one of those women though. HOWEVER I was not happy with how Hazel handled this movie. Example: “Pixie haired gorgeous girl dislikes authority and can’t help fall for  a boy she knows is trouble” (pg. 17). THAT IS AN EXTREMELY OVERSIMPLIFIED EXPLANATION OF THAT MOVIE. V for Vendetta is one of my favorite movies. It is probably my significant others favorite movie. Now Hazel says “It was kind of a boy movie. I don’t know why boys expect us to like boy movies. We don’t expect them to like girl movies” (pg. 35). What? NO. I am a girl. I have seen this movie. I love this movie. I disagree that it is a girl movie. I think this movie is too complicated to have in this book. They are not on the same level. John Green is diminishing the awesome nature of this movie in this book. I hated the whole part about V for Vendetta.Overall, I do give it a 4/5. I really did like it. It wasn’t too long, it was just certain things that I really didn’t like.If you are a girl and haven’t seen V for Vendetta, go watch it. like right now."
3," The Fault in Our Stars is about two star- crossed lovers who have a unique relationship created from wit and a similar perspective of being physically disabled. The story is told from a person account by a young girl named Hazel Lancaster. Hazel is a 16 year old girl who suffers from Thyroid cancer and long-settled satellite colony in her lungs. She lives a depressing life as she hasn’t gone to school in three years and attends support group often. In support group, Hazel befriends a boy named Isaac who has a form of eye cancer. One day, Isaac brought another boy named Augustus Waters to support group so he could announce that he would be going blind very soon. Augustus is 17 and he had Osteosarcoma a year and a half prior which resulted in Augustus’ leg being removed and being placed with a prosthetic.After that day, they quickly bonded over their love of the books An Imperial Affliction and The Price of Dawn series. An Imperial Affliction was Hazel’s favorite book written by Peter Van Houten about a girl who suffers from cancer and how her mom copes with it while her mom meets the Dutch Tulip Man. Hazel and Augustus read the book and have deep discussions on lingering questions they would ask the author about the book if they ever had the chance. Due to the fact that all cancer kids receive a wish from the “ genies”, Augustus thought he would surprise Hazel with the idea of going to Amsterdam to meet Peter Van Houten and that became the first time Augustus told Hazel that he loved her. Hazel began to have a fluid problem which nearly caused the trip to be cancelled but it continued as planned. On their first full day in Amsterdam, Hazel and Augustus went to finally ask the questions about their favorite book to Peter Van Houten. Not only did Van Houten not answer Hazel’s questions but he stated his opinion on the harsh reality of a being a cancer patient which sent the two kids over the edge. Van Houten’s assistant apologized for his behavior as she drove Augustus and Hazel to the Anne Frank house. This is where Augustus and Hazel shared their first kiss followed by their first time having sex back at the Filosoof, their hotel in Amsterdam. Then the truth came out about Augustus’ real physical condition. Augustus’ cancer came back and it continued to get worse.Things just weren’t the same after the Amsterdam trip. About a month after the trip, Augustus had Isaac and Hazel write obituaries for him because he knew he would die and surely enough he died eight days later. A plot twist as Hazel was in worse condition in the beginning but Augustus is the one who died in the end. The funeral took place in the basement of the nearby church and Hazel and Isaac spoke. The surprise is that Peter Van Houten showed up to apologize at Augustus’ funeral. He explained that he struggled to talk to Hazel and Augustus because he had a young daughter who died of cancer and he had no companionship other than his paid assistant and hazel understood. Augustus had sure enough written something to Van Houten about Hazel just before he died.  It stated the details about their love story and how Augustus was lucky to love someone like Hazel. The Fault in Our Stars portrayed a unique love story for two unlikely people."
4,"m going to give all my compliments here at the beginning, so  that no one thinks of this as one of those negative reviews. See the stars I gave it? 5/5.This book was fantastic. The message was thought provoking, the characters were lovable (at least after a while), the plot was interesting enough, although a bit depressing. If I had to rate all the books I've read in the past year, this would probably be Number 1.Romance novels aren't exactly my cup of tea, but I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and pretty much everything about it. That's why I feel I'm capable of giving a little...critique, I suppose the word is.I'm not going to be one of those jerks who says that the teenagers didn't speak or act or think like teenagers. First of all, that's kinda how I think, speak, and act, so who is an adult to say that's wrong? Secondly, once you're sure you're going to die, you start to think, speak, and act differently.So you might be wondering what I have to criticize about this. I'll tell you: it is fine for the main character to think like she did. She seems very mature, and she's been forced to mature even faster. I'll even say it's okay for Gus to think that way, because he's had similar experiences and, you know, they're kinda-sorta soulmates. But when practically every character speaks, thinks, and acts that way (except for the loathed non-cancer-people...what are they called?), the voices start to blur together.For you nerds out there (or anyone with the hots for Jennifer Lawrence, Hugh Jackman, or assorted others), I ask you to remember a scene from the recent movie X-Men Days of Future Past. (Small Spoiler Alert). In one scene, Raven is walking through an airport while Charles speaks to her through the people around her. They sound like they should--their actual voices are the same--but they speak like Charles. That's because that's all it is. Raven can tell immediately that it's Charles speaking, because he talks like Charles. Well that and other things.Back to the point. I think that in the same way, John Green hijacks the voices of his characters, so that they all speak the same ways. It's actually pretty easy to overlook, and I think in a way, it's not about the individual characters because they're all gonna die anyway. So maybe that's why it's okay for some people to talk the same. Who knows but John Green. Maybe someone will travel to ask him.Oh yeah, and did I mention every characters' deep hatred of people who haven't experienced cancer? Does everyone with cancer hate us without it? Or is that just Hazel?"
4," When I started reading this book I found it unexpectedly hilarious and kept laughing out loud. My husband started asking me why it was so funny and what was it about. I responded by explaining how it was a book about teens with cancer... And he then looked at me like I was insane, because how could that possibly be humorous?And yet it is. It truly is. It's also predictably a serious tear-jerker. An emotional roller-coaster that makes you feel so many different emotions. I love how each character tackles their battle in a different way, and how teenage angst and rebellion puts a new spin on the tragedy of cancer. Everyone's just trying to cope in their own ways, and heal in their own ways. It's heartbreaking, and heartwarming all at the same time.I recommend you read this for real and not just wait for the movie to come out. I finished it in a few days, it was really hard to put down. It deserves to be read, not just watched. I can't imagine how Hollywood can possibly capture the mix of humor and tragedy as well as the written word does.It did seem a little unbelievable how smart and well rounded these characters were. I don't know many adults that are as smart and analytic as the main character, and the witty banter she carries out with everyone else seems to channel Gilmore Girls dialog. But hey it's fiction and it's nice to see a story that gives young people more credit for possessing unique and deep thoughts, and for making good decisions and being selfless, instead of teens just mooning about their teenage vampire love interests... If my daughter was older, these are the type of characters I'd want her to look up to. That doesn't mean it's just a story for teens, I'm 30 and I thoroughly enjoyed it and felt challenged by the themes, and thoughts, but I am glad that a story like this is being made into a movie that the next generation of teens will see because it provides better role models I believe.Anyway... To sum up, really touching story that makes you feel a variety of emotions. I loved it and you should definitely read it!"
5," have more reviews like this in my blog http://ccarpelibrum.blogspot.com/ check it out.Thoughts prior to reading it:This book only came to my attention after a close friend of mine kept talking about it and telling me how excited she was about this movie. I happened to snag some advanced screening tickets and took my friends (five total) to go watch it. My friend who had read this was beyond ecstatic and so I had high hopes for this movie. She had warned me that I would probably cry. I scoffed at the thought of me crying because I am not one to cries in public but when I watched the movie I was proven wrong. So many people were crying some were wailing. In the end I could not hold in my tears and they spilled. So my friends and I were all sitting together crying, I was crying, they were crying and my nose was running and I was a mess because I absolutely fell in love with the story and I couldn't stop crying over Augustus and Hazel. So many feels! So I knew I had to read it ASAP.Thoughts after reading it:I still loved the book even after having watched the movie. I realized there were a few things the movie left out but the quality of the movie wasn't affected because they kept intact what absolutely mattered. Augustus and Hazel. I thought that after having watched the movie this book would not affect me as much emotionally but John Green has such a way of writing that I still got plenty of feels throughout the book. I know I was so late in reading this book so many of you have already read it but for those of you who haven't I highly suggest it. Some are weary about reading this book because it is about kids with cancer. Yes this is indeed a sad topic but this book shows us how some infinities are bigger than other infinities and we must take into account the time we have and make do with what little we may have. It doesn't mean our time is inferior to another person's because they had more time than us. They can both be just as great if not greater.The book begins with Hazel who has been diagnosed with depression. Which is a side effect in cancer patient or so she is told. She comes to her own conclusion that depression is not a side effect of cancer but rather is a side effect of dying and that cancer is by extension a side effect of dying as well. Hazel's mother begins to take Hazel to a support group with other teens with the best intentions. It is there that Hazel meets Augustus Waters and the story begins to unravel. It is clear that there is a strong connection between Hazel and Augustus but Hazel doesn't want to be more than friends because she knows she is a terminally ill patient and wants to limit the people she hurts around her to a minimum but this task becomes very difficult when Augustus clearly doesn't seem to have the same intentions.Yes pick this book up you will fall in love with it, you will cry and in the end you will want to watch the movie as well if you haven't done so already."
5," Describe this book in one sentence- A story about a girl and a boy who have deathly illnesses, but make the most out of their lives. Moral- Love prevails even through the worst obstacles life throws at us. Rating- PG-13 Why this rating?- Some thematic elements, some sexuality, and brief strong language. For ages- 14-35 Recommended to- Fans of Sarah Dessen mixed with Nickolas Sparks and Shakespeare. Stars- Three and one half out of Five. Why this number of stars-The Cover~ While the title was a wonderful nod to Shakespeare, I don't understand the cover. My mother suggested that the two clouds were a symbol. The dark cloud, in her guess, was a symbol of the sickness, and the white, the symbol of the hope and friendship between the two main characters. While her guess seems to be the best I've come across, I know not what was going on in the cover designer's mind when formulating this design. *spoilers* in this next section. Proceed with *caution*.The Content~ The plot was thoroughly thought out and well placed, however a bit predictable. I know everyone says it was totally unpredictable, however if John Green is a good author (which I believe he is),  he will kill or hurt the character everyone will least expect him to do something to. I was still saddened though when he met my favorite character with a terribly unhappy ending. I did not (I know bad me), however cry when this happened. I know, I have already been told that I have no soul. There is no need.Character Development~ I have to be honest, I feel like Green was a bit lacking in this department. I saw a bit of growth happen with the Hazel character, but feel as if the Augustus character didn't go anywhere. At times I found Hazel annoying and had trouble identifying with her. Hazel's parents were interesting characters who, I believe, showed quite a bit of development trough the story.Would I read the second book?- I can't imagine what a second book would be... I will read more books by John Green though.Publication Date- Jan 10, 2012Publisher- Dutton Books"
5," was traveling down to florida, a long 12 hour journey ahead of me, I found myself with a perfect opportunity to listen to my audio book of The Fault in Our Stars. I had heard so many raves about TFIOS, and that even though it was in a genre I normally don't read, I was feeling very tempted to try it out.... I AM SO GLAD I DID.  I loved it so much I didn't want my trip to end, I just wanted to continuously drive until it was done.I don't want to give away too much of the story because I was pleasantly surprised that the plot was still very much a surprise to me. Even though everyone talks about this book and there are endless movie trailers for TFIOS, I was very surprised that they did not give away the plot for the book. TFIOS follows Hazel, as a young girl suffering from lung cancer, and Hazel meets Augustus at a group meeting.  TFIOS follows these two as they battle cancer, friendship, and living each day like it might be your last.The situations that Hazel and Gus deal with, no matter how difficult, are met with humor, sarcasm and wit. They both had a way of handling their hard situations with words that was just... perfect! I personally don't have the words to describe it, but I have no doubt that Hazel and Gus would !About the Audio Book.I don't have too much experience with listening to audio books. I have listened to a few, however this was hands down the BEST AUDIO BOOK I HAVE EVER READ LISTENED TO. I didn't think it made a difference on who the audio book was read by, I was wrong! TFIOS was read by Kate Rudd and it was extremely easy to listen to. I felt like she embodied the spirit of Hazel and read every line with as much wit and sarcasm that each line deserved. I listened to this audiobook as easily as I could watch a movie. I laughed, I cried, It was an amazing experience and I highly recommend this audiobook, and any audiobooks that Kate Rudd read whole heartedly."
3," was skeptical at first about reading this book. The way the cover looks, and all the hype about it recently, made me feel like it might be another 'tween-thing', not unlike the Twilight series. I read some good reviews on it, and saw the decent ratings, so I thought, Why the heck not?. And I don't have any terminal illness myself but I thought that it would be interesting to read about someone's perspective on life who does.Right off the bat, I actually enjoyed her sarcasm. It might be appalling to some people to joke about death in the ways that the main character (Hazel) does, but I think if I was in the same situation, I probably would too. Hazel made me realize that she has every right to be sarcastic and joking when it comes to her situation, especially since she is constantly being treated like someone with a terminal illness. You know, the Oh you poor thing... comments and looks.The story also somewhat appealed to the young adult in me with it's love interest. The fact that she keeps pushing away and he (Augustus) keeps pushing back makes you absolutely yearn for them to just GET TOGETHER ALREADY! Plus, it was a beautiful thing, too young adults with possibly deadly illnesses finding tentative, but honest love.I think this book offers so much more though than a 'tween-like' love interest. It really puts cancer and other diseases into perspective for the reader. I know it has me reviewing the ways that I think about and treat people who may be sick or dying, or those who have experienced loss. It made me realize that those type of people might act out harshly, do something crazy, or push others away, and I can't jump to conclusions about someone like that, because I've never experienced the type of questions they have to ask themselves, and the pain that they've gone through.It really is a beautiful story for any age. I laughed and cried. I hope you do as well..."
5," Posted first to Blog Critics as Book Review:'The Fault in our Stars' by John Green.Cancer is such a dreadful disease, indiscriminate in its choice of victim, choosing with aplomb regardless of age, gender or status.  There are a myriad of stories behind the tragedy and many of them remain untold.In The Fault in Our Stars by John Green, he builds a story out of darkness and despair.  He takes the tragedy of cancer and immerses us in the lives of characters that could very well be real. Many know of the heartaches in dealing with those who fight the fight, and many of those scars last a lifetime.  He brings his story in the form of a teen girl, Hazel Lancaster.  Stricken with cancer from a young age, she believes she has come to terms with what her life has become. Then she meets a young man, Augustus Waters, a survivor of cancer. He is drawn to her in a way that is initially uncomfortable, and as she tries to push him away in her sarcastic vein, he finds her to be exactly the type of girl he has been looking for.  Throughout the story there is a beauty and humor, a ‘candle in the wind’ for each of those whose lives have been touched by such an uncaring disease. For cancer touches not just the victim but all those who love and are in anyway touched by them.Be prepared for a story of romance and anger, excitement and humor, and friendship and bravery for that is the direction we are led as Green develops the personality of a group of teens that have the courage to bring both laughter and tears.  The story’s that encircle each individual gives you a glimpse of the character and daring as well as the abiding hope.  Hidden within that strength they also hide the depression and hopelessness as they try hard to protect their family and friends by showing only the smiles and strength whenever possible.Written so beautifully your heart and emotions melt, you come to be a part of this group as well as their families, their triumphs and their losses. The friendships as well as the depths the families go through preparing for the worst while holding out hope is like a beacon of light.The courage and humor, the energy and despair all keep you on a roller coaster of emotion.  Green takes you on a journey both terrible and beautiful.While a difficult book to categorize I found it to be one of the most important finds of the last few years. Green shines a light on cancer in a way that sends a tremor of intent awareness, an incandescent monument to those that have both won and lost the fight, as well as the damage done to those closest.  The story blasts away the veil of secrecy and hooks you from the very beginning."
5," This is a VERY popular book and I finally got around to reading it because I kept hearing things about it. It took some young women from my church to get me to finally sit down and read it! First things first. Did I cry...nope. Everyone I've talked to told me they sobbed and cried like a baby when reading this story. I got a LITTLE misty eyed but I didn't cry. I can totally see what people cried though. it's a very heart warming story and you become attached to characters almost from page 1.The story is about a girl named Hazel who is is in remission from problems with her lungs that have left her lungs weak and so she will always need the aid of an oxygen tank wherever she goes. She as a character (to me) seemed very bitter with life and what has happened to her, I felt like she secluded herself due to her illness and withdrew herself from life and people other than her parents and even then I felt like she kept them at a distance because she knew that death would always be lurking for her.Hazel hates going to support group, that is until a guy-a very cute guy-won't stop staring at her, name Augustus or Gus.Gus is also in remission from bone cancer that took part of one leg. He is the most uplifting and happy guy there who regardless of what life has thrown him gives and takes from life at its fullest and as a reader you just fall in love with him. He is pure awesomeness.As Gus and Hazel interact the character development on Hazel's side was subtle and well written you could see her grow and change because a boy saw her differently instead of seeing her handicap or illness.It truly is a wonderful story and I can see why people gravitate to it. It's a coming of age, and a coming to terms, and a live-life-to-it's-fullest story that draw people in.However I do warn people (or young adults) that there is some content that may be inappropriate. just be aware.Sexual Content: moderate (PG-13,with the understanding that 2 characters sleep together-once, some innuendoes from a hormonal side character)Language: moderate (PG-13)Violence: mildDrugs/Alcohol: mild (there is a character who is a drunk)"
2," The Fault in Our Stars is about a teenage girl named Hazel Grace who is battling to just live as much as a normal life as she can while battling cancer. She was fortunate enough to live past the age the doctors believed she wouldn’t make it past in her younger years. The battle she was struggling through was her failing lungs; she constantly had to carry around her oxygen tank, which really was her life support. Going through life day by day battling cancer really caused her to have a higher maturity level than most teens would have at her age. She lived vicariously through the book An Imperial Affliction by Peter Van Houten. The reason she enjoys it so much is because she can relate to the book since it is about a cancer patient in itself. Her insight on life seems a little dark because she doesn’t feel like she has to set a purpose in the world, since everyone just dies anyway. This book encourages her beliefs on this, which actually gives her some sort of peace. Little did she know, her perspective on life took a complete turn for the best when she met Augustus Waters in their “cancer survival group”. Augustus is full of life and believes that his purpose in life is to be bold and leave a mark in the world. The passion he has for Hazel is the most heartwarming thing to read about. He goes completely out of his way to make Hazel feel like the beautiful girl she is, and makes it known how much she is truly loved in this world. Together they take on the world together enjoying the passionate love they have for each other. When I saw the previews about The Fault in Our Stars, I was automatically hooked and wanted to read this book. My grandfather passed away from cancer, and he has been my ultimate inspiration throughout my life; when I found out this book was about battling cancer I knew I needed to read it. This book is very organized, and definitely keeps you questioning how things will end up working out for the very end. John Green does an excellent job at revealing the characters emotions to where it really does feel like you are experiencing what is going on in their life alongside them.  I absolutely love romantic stories, and this one truly gives you a definition of the value of love and how important it is for one not to take another for granted. One of the quotes from this book that really stuck out to me was when Hazel was telling Augustus not to fall in love with her because she doesn’t know how long she has left to live; as a response to this, Augustus says, “Oh, I wouldn't mind, Hazel Grace. It would be a privilege to have my heart broken by you.” It is evident he is absolutely head over heels for Hazel Grace, and couldn’t imagine life (for as long was allotted) without her. I fell so in love with how incredible of a person Augustus is! What I also really enjoyed about this book is that it is very realistic, and not so to say “sugar-coated”. Reading this book really allows you to put into perspective how incredibly hard it must be to experience this battle of cancer. My dream is to be a Pediatric Oncology Nurse so this book really helped me to develop an even deeper understanding on what they go through physically as well as emotionally. This book is definitely a tearjerker; I cried so many times. The beauty of the book is the life lesson that we all should cherish each day given, because in the end we never really are given a set amount of time to live. The quote from the book that I feel suits this statement is when Hazel talks about the reason she enjoys Van Houten’s book. Hazel says, “That’s part of what I like about the book in some ways. It portrays death truthfully. You die in the middle of your life, in the middle of a sentence”. Another quote I really enjoyed that really inspires us to live and love to the fullest is this, “you gave me a forever within the numbered days, and I'm grateful.” So inspirational! I highly recommend this book to anyone. You will truly feel like a different person after reading this book because it is so encouraging to live in the best way you can."

YesBook Summary:Hazel Grace Lancaster and Augustus (Gus) Waters meet at a Cancer Kid Support Group to cope with having cancer; their mutual friend named Isaac also deals with his own battle and joins the two protagonists.  Hazel and Gus serves a fresh perspectives on cancer: about beating cancer as well as people’s reaction after death to those how have been beaten by cancer.  Hazel and Gus bond over a fictitious unfinished story called, An Imperial Affliction. They go to Amsterdam to talk to the author Van Houten in order to find the answers to their questions and find out what happens in the end of Imperial.Book Review:The Faults in Our Stars starts out like a bad young adult book and I was skeptical at first when the two first characters meet.  Teen romances with an introduction of a “hot boy” immediately sets off alarms, making me think that this book isn’t going to be as good as everyone says it is. Keep reading- it is.  You will find yourself agreeing with Hazel’s honest perspectives on cancer and will relate to the characters who just want to make a difference in the world before they die. Don’t we all want that for ourselves?This story will stay with you for days.  The book will tie up loose ends if you pay attention.  To me, you will find some answers to “An Imperial Affliction” if you draw parallels to Hazel’s life.  For example, Hazel’s mom finds meaning and ways to continue which answers the question to what happens to the mother of the fictitious character.I did not particularly care for the plot line of Amsterdam and the character Van Houten. I thought that was contrived.  It didn’t add much to the story.Favorite Quotes:I cannot find it right now but I remember it goes something to the effect of how “the universe sometimes wants to be felt.”  It was a commentary about how the unfair randomness of life serving terminal illness.“Almost everyone is obsessed with leaving a mark upon the world.  Bequeathing a legacy. Outlasting death. We all want to be remembered. I do.” (p.310)Random thoughts: :I started reading this book because so many people kept talking about it. The movie was out and it was receiving a lot of attention.  There was a few sad parts in the book but didn’t cry like everyone said I would. Not sure if that’s more of a commentary about me.  The only regret I have about this book is that I picked up the cover that had the two kids on the front. I should have just stuck with the regular cover"
5," recently read the Fault in our Stars, and would like to post my own opinion on this book coming from the lips (or more like fingers) of my thirteen year old mouth.First off, I am no cancer survivor, and have never been diagnosed with a terminal illness. But despite my lack of anything cancer, I have known several people whose family members have either been suffering from it or have passed away. In the Fault in our Stars, I believe that they displayed the emotions of a sixteen year old, cancer fighting and sassy girl rather well.On some of the reviews I have read, some of the complaints go like this:They don't realistically act or think like a normal teenager.I find this kind of insulting. Just because some teenagers out there in the world decide to go around cussing, and acting like fools, I think it is rather ignorant to generalize all of us in the same category.Another complaint was written like this, and I paraphrase here:Hazel talks likes she is so depressed. Or something like that.Well, I have to mention this, Hazel is a sixteen year old girl who is diagnosed with a terminal illness of cancerous tumors inside of her lungs. She can't breath. She can't overexert herself. She can't run for long distances. If you knew yourself that you were most likely going to die before you reached your twenties, would you be jumping up and down with joy?In the TFiOS, I thought that John Green explored the passions of life and made the book a part of sadness and joy. Woven into each page was a message, and some were clearer than others. We just have to look harder.Hazel Grace was a character I could root for, not only because she was strong and sassy, but because she was enjoying life to its fullest with what time she was given. She didn't want to be stuck in one area, she didn't want to live her life in a wheelchair, so she did something about it. I think that is a message we can all take to heart. If there is something we truly want, like REALLY want, then go for it. If you can change it, great. But if you can't change it, then find some way to deal with it.Hazel also had a good head on her shoulders and a uh, formidable vocabulary, To be honest, I had to read it with a dictionary, because the simple fact is, I didn't exactly know what osteosarcoma or proverbial meant until I researched it. I would like to say I did, but I didn't. Just being honest here...All together, I think this book explored happiness and sadness, loss and gain, love and hate. There were some questionable things within its pages, but the main message behind it all easily overpowers anything I had a problem with (I'll go into more detail later after I get through praising it--praise first, criticism last). While I read it, it really got me thinking, and it totally implanted in my heart a sympathy for people with cancer, as well as a thankfulness for what I do have, not what I don't.But now, since nothing can be perfect, are the negatives. (I hope you weren't waiting for this part, because it is relatively short).1. I did not like all the cursing, I thought it was unnecessary. Someone with such a vast, dictionary imploring, vocabulary as Augustus and Hazel would not be using words like damn. At least, not in my book.2. I did not like it that everything seemed anti-Jesus. Hazel would continually blast Him because she had cancer, she would curse him out in her thoughts, and there were several (frequent) parts where other people would do the same. Once again, just my opinion.3.  Some of the parts were a little unrealistic. Now, I won't go into some spill about how there is just no LOGIC or that it's just so improbable that it would happen, but I thought it was faintly unrealistic that Hazel's mother would allow her to reside in a hotel alone with some guy (who is super hot, and turns her daughter on) in a room out of her sight. If I was a parent, I can assure you, my daughter would NOT be going alone with no hot guy to a solitary place--unless of course they were married.4. Some of the characters all sounded alike. Sarcastic humor, witty comebacks, and a love for quotations. I loved the quotations by the way, so don't get me wrong.But that concludes my review on John Green's amazing book the FAULT IN OUR STARS. I would definitely recommend it to everyone out there, as a book that gets you thinking and thankful. I would give it a higher rating if I could, but unfortunately, an infinitesimal array of rating stars is not available on Amazon.Have a great life, and have a great time reading this book as well. You will NOT be disappointed.  ~A Reviewer"
4," Before reading this book, I had not seen the movie nor had any idea what was held between the front cover and the last page. I had no idea what it was based on, about or the message it portrayed; except it was your typical chick-flick. As I started this book my interest hadn't been sparked until a few chapters in, yet I still continued through, hoping it's stereotype wasn't the only truth and emotion it entitled. I've never been much of a bookworm nor was the type of person who felt any emotional attachment to a novel let alone an author. I am not the kind of person who would take the time to write a review on some words some random guy wrote; yet here I am.  It may be a first but I feel I owe it to Mr. Green as Hazel did for Mr. Van Houten. Although I imagine Mr. Green in no way, shape or form portraying any resemblance to Van Houten personality wise. Like I had mentioned before it may be my boredom leading to maddness but I believe it is the book itself and the talent that lies in the mind of Mr. Green.  I fell in love with the plot, the characters, the selfless acts, the relationships and the realism along with everything else embedded in the few hundred pages. I fell in love with the bond and love the two shared; the epitome of as Gus` family recognized, not puppy love instead true love only some hope to find. I think the knowing of not having something last forever, only some unfortunately are constantly reminded, creates a much stronger and more genuine passion. I could go on and on, because 1. I'm very expressive about things I'm passionate about and 2. I really have never written a review before but to end it on a good note and hopefully reassure any in decisiveness or second thoughts, read this review and then I think we both know what the outcome will be. Also I want to thank Mr. Green, although this will probably never be seen or held to high enough standards for him to even consider reading my opinion, but thank you for showing me a new love for literature and he should know and be proud enough in his work that his writing truly does change lives.  I feel I owed a written and public appreciation towards Hazel and Gus as well knowing the story and the beginning of their little infinity. I hope you all enjoy and take from this book as much I did! And just in case, Mr. Green, if you ever see this I would love a response; thank you!"
5," purchased and read this book AFTER seeing the <a class=a-link-normal href=/movie/dp/B00KAJ2K0Y>movie</a>.  I had known of the book's popularity, but I hadn't really read anything *about* it.  I'd been disappointed by too many popular young adult books that were poorly written to appeal to its supposed dumbed-down audience.  When I eventually saw the preview for the movie, I felt like it would be a good story to see on the big screen, so I still didn't read anything further about the plot because I didn't want to spoil the upcoming movie for me.Watching the movie in the theater was cathartic...and I was a big pile of emotional goo by movie's end.  Walking out of the theater, I already missed the characters portrayed by Shailene Woodley (whom I loved in <a class=a-link-normal href=/The-Descendants/dp/B004UXUX4Q>The Descendants</a> and Ansel Elgort (whom I'd never heard of before, but instantly liked after reading an article about the movie in Entertainment Weekly).  That's when I knew I had to buy the book to see these beautiful characters all over again.  If they were this fantastic on the screen, they had to be equally wonderful in book form.As I had hoped, the book was equally magical and entertaining.  The characters leapt off the page.  John Green's writing and character development was as beautiful on the page as it was on screen.  I loved that Hazel Grace and Augustus didn't change from book to screen (or screen to book, in my case).  To quote Hazel about her favorite (fictional) book, An Imperial Affliction: ...the author seemed to understand me in weird and impossible ways. [It] was my book in the way my body was my body and my thoughts were my thoughts.When I was a teenager, Augustus was the type of boy that I always dreamed about meeting.  He's a bad boy with a big heart.  He's protective, yet weak around me.  He's flirtatious.  He's confident.  He's intelligent.  He's witty.  He's sarcastic, but not hurtful.  He has a disability that may ward off others but that I find endearing because it makes him more human and caring.  I, too had a crush on, and fell in love with Augustus just as Hazel did: ...the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once.Like Hazel's favorite book, An Imperial Affliction, I didn't want the book to end.  I didn't want the lives of the characters to end.  I know it's a very literary decision and everything and probably part of the reason I love the book so much, but there is something to recommend a story that ends.  And if it can't end, then it should at least continue into perpetuity...  The Fault in Our Stars, Augustus Waters, and Hazel Grace Lancaster will forever continue into perpetuity.Also like Hazel and her favorite book, I felt like I want to know what happens after the end of the story.  Well, I do and I don't.  I know what happens to Augustus, but I don't know what happens to Hazel.  But...do I want to know?  That's the question.  Theirs is a beautiful story of friendship and love, and perfect just the way it is.  I don't think I'd want to ruin it by seeing Hazel with anyone else.I purchased and read this book AFTER seeing the movie.

I don't think I'd want to ruin it by seeing Hazel with anyone else.This is definitely one of the best books I've read in a long time -- young adult or adult.  I hope that, like A Separate Peace, 1984, A Farewell To Arms, and Lord of the Flies, this book will one day be part of the middle or high school English curriculum and studied for its beautiful, well-written story full of multiple meanings, which offer many opportunities for thought and discussion.I hope that, like <a class=a-link-normal href=/A-Separate-Peace/dp/0743253973>A Separate Peace</a>,<a class=a-link-normal href=/1984/dp/0451524934>1984</a>,<a class=a-link-normal href=/A-Farewell-To-Arms/dp/0684801469>A Farewell To Arms</a>, and <a class=a-link-normal href=/Lord-of-the-Flies/dp/0399501487>Lord of the Flies</a>, this book will one day be part of the middle or high school English curriculum and studied for its beautiful, well-written story full of multiple meanings, which offer many opportunities for thought and discussion."
5," Before I read this book, I had seen so much merchandise put out for those who had. At first I thought Well, maybe it's just really good, then I saw tattoos. That's when I became intrigued. This book must be the new Harry Potter or something if everyone and their grandpas are getting tattoos of Okay?Okay. So I bought the book. The book over all was great. It was well written(Plot wise) and what do you know, a totally expected death at the end. This book does have nice quotes and mind boggling philosophical meaning behind what seems to be every single detail in the book. However, with the all the rage, I'm a little upset to say that I was not moved. Not because I'm heartless, not because I just didn't understand the deeper meaning of the story, but simply because everything was so...expected. Also I can't say I enjoyed Mr. Green's writing style, while I know it made the story more realistic and personable, seeing it was from the point of view of a girl my age, it felt a little pushed and stale. Plus, this girl was supposedly different from normal girls. I felt it should have had a more mature feel since she was initially the main character. I actually rolled my eyes a few times while reading just because of the way the whole thing was narrated. I'm not saying it was a terrible book, really overall the one thing that killed it for me was the way it was written. Don't get me wrong, the story itself was heartwarming and heartbreaking, however, the writing style was to distracting. If it were presented a little better, perhaps, I may have felt more emotion for the male character's death, but unfortunately I had already expected this to happen and was not surprised like most who've claimed they cried at this sudden and tragic death. I feel that maybe John Green's other books might be more interesting, considering they may not be from the point of view of a young girl with cancer. I have to say he was not very...exceptional at it from what I'd gathered in The Fault Of Our Stars."
5," When I chose to read John Green's The Fault in Our Stars it was partially because the story is being adapted into a movie, and partially because I had heard the book is brilliant. Everything I have heard about this book is true; it is beautifully written, heart-wrenching, and physically impossible to put down.TFIOS follows the misadventures of two teenagers whose lives have been dramatically shaped by cancer. Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters meet in a support group, and immediately find themselves drawn to each other. Hazel, who is introverted but highly analytical, begins letting charismatic and eccentric Augustus into her life. Hazel shares with him her favorite book, a fiction which has evolved into her emotional bible, but which ends abruptly in the middle of a sentence. This ultimately brings them together as they endeavor to learn how the story actually ends, and what becomes of its characters. As they pursue answers to their literary questions, Hazel and Augustus attempt to navigate the complications of living with cancer, together.This book surprised me. I knew that it is geared towards the young-adult crowd, and didn't quite know what to expect. However, I was happily surprised to discover that Augustus and Hazels' story is told in a narrative that weaves beautiful prose with profound concepts which transcend any age bracket: The world, he said, is not a wish-granting factory, and then he broke down, just for one moment, his sob roaring impotent like a clap of thunder unaccompanied by lightning, the terrible ferocity that amateurs in the field of suffering might mistake for weakness.  (214).While the language used is wielded in an intelligent manner, the story is still the narrative of a sixteen year old girl, and therefore has an undertone of mild cynicism throughout. However, it is a flavor of cynicism which supports a subtle analysis on how society and individuals approach terminal illness. Throughout the story, complex existential concepts are explored and analyzed, such as the universal fear of oblivion, and the speculation of an afterlife. Despite the gravity of the subject matter, there is a suprising note of wry humor throughout. The dialogue is witty and sharp.TFIOS is essentially one long, beautifully composed commentary on the profound effect one person has on the world and the people in his or her life. It is a love story. It is not sugar-coated. Simply, The Fault in Our Stars is devastatingly good. If you are hunting for a book that will leave you with the warm and fuzzies, keep searching. But if your palate wants a read which will make you think -- and keep on thinking, long after the last page -- read this book."
4,"m probably one of the last people on the planet to read The Fault in Our Stars. It feels like that anyway.Author John Green has a way of making these characters seem like real people and he infuses quirkiness and humor while he tells this story.Hazel Lancaster is sixteen and has had terminal cancer for years. Augustus Waters is seventeen years old and is in remission. The two meet at a cancer support group. Also in the storyline are the teens family and friends.When reading Young Adult, I have often found the teenage characters to be annoying and/or whiny, but that was not the case here. Hazel and Augustus are more mature than the usual YA characters, it has to do with their sickness and all that they have to go through. They view life differently than others. I really liked both of these characters.The romance is sweet and just enough, without being too much. Green writes two people and makes them belong together. I also enjoyed that Hazel and Gus are readers, I like books that have books in them. One main aspect of the story is Hazel's trying to meet her favorite author.This is a story about teenagers with cancer, but it is also a story about love, hope, courage and family.I do recommend it. I found The Fault in Our Stars to be a highly readable and moving story. Very emotional, yet somehow almost light at times. The film stays true to the book and this is one of those rare cases where I enjoyed both film and novel versions pretty much equally.I read The Fault in Our Stars in a few sittings by the lake on lazy summer afternoons and thoroughly enjoyed it. I want to read more by this author.disclaimer:This review is my honest opinion. I did not receive any type of compensation for reading and reviewing this book. While I receive free books from publishers and authors, I am under no obligation to write a positive review. I purchased my copy of The Fault in Our Stars."
5," The Fault in Our Stars tells the heart-wrenching story of terminal cancer patient Hazel Grace Lancaster who finally acquiesces and joins a support group at the behest of her well-intentioned parents. There she meets the charming boy, Augustus Waters, in attendance to support his friend Isaac who is losing his sight to cancer. Hazel and Augustus hit it off immediately and he fills her bleak, numbered days with beauty and love.I loved the romance between Hazel and Augustus.“May I see you again?” he asked. There was an endearing nervousness in his voice.I smiled. “Sure.”“Tomorrow?” he asked.“Patience, grasshopper,” I counseled. “You don’t want to seem overeager.“Right, that’s why I said tomorrow,” he said. “I want to see you again tonight. But I’m willing to wait all night and much of tomorrow.” I rolled my eyes. “I’m serious,” he said.“You don’t even know me,” I said. I grabbed the book from the center console. “How about I call you when I finish this?”“But you don’t even have my phone number,” he said.“I strongly suspect you wrote it in this book.”He broke out into that goofy smile. “And you say we don’t know each other.”I loved the humor in this book. Here is a bit of dialogue where Augustus and Hazel are talking with Augustus’ family:“It’s just that most really good-looking people are stupid, so I exceed expectations.”“Right, it’s primarily his hotness,” I said.“It can be sort of blinding,” he said.“It actually did blind our friend Isaac,” I said.“Terrible tragedy, that. But can I help my own deadly beauty?”“You cannot.”“It is my burden, this beautiful face.”“Not to mention your body.”“Seriously, don’t even get me started on my hot bod. You don’t want to see me naked, Dave. Seeing me naked actually took Hazel Grace’s breath away,” he said, nodding toward the oxygen tank.I loved the introspection.“Without pain, how could we know joy? This is an old argument in the field of thinking about suffering and its stupidity and lack of sophistication could be plumbed for centuries but suffice it to say that the existence of broccoli does not, in any way, affect the taste of chocolate.”And finally, I loved how a finite number of days can turn into a little infinity when you spend it with someone you love.“There are infinite numbers between 0 and 1. There’s .1 and .12 and .112 and an infinite collection of others. Of course, there is a bigger infinite set of numbers between 0 and 2, or between 0 and a million. Some infinities are bigger than other infinities. A writer we used to like taught us that. There are days, many of them, when I resent the size of my unbounded set. I want more numbers than I’m likely to get… But, Gus, my love, I cannot tell you how thankful I am for our little infinity. I wouldn’t trade it for the world. You gave me a forever within the numbered days, and I’m grateful.”I’ve seen a few reviews where the reader believes the language used by the teens in the book is too advanced for the characters to be believable. When I was a teen, intelligence and popularity seemed to have an inverse relationship. You risked being labeled a nerd if you were too smart. To fit in, I suspect many of us pretended to be less competent than we were. It’s sad, but true, at least from my experience. I applaud the way John Green created characters that were witty, erudite teens. Let’s give our young adults books that are intelligent and thought-provoking, books that may have them reaching for the dictionary, but I suspect our youth is far wiser than they sometimes let on.I loved, loved, loved this book. It’s proof I don’t need a “happily ever after” to enjoy a book. After all, “the world is not a wish-granting factory.”"
5," Two teenagers trapped in losing struggles with lethal forms of cancer find each other and then briefly find the richness of life that comes through the power of love.  Green cuts through all the schmaltz through his characters, who openly mock and despise any and all sentimentality that comes their way as they soldier through daily struggles against this deadly foe they know will eventually take their lives in a very unsentimental fashion.  Think of the normal cynicism and snarkiness of your average, intelligent teen, then add a huge dollop of a debilitating and lethal disease, then  cut through all the Hallmark attempts to gloss over this horrible and tragic state of affairs, and you've got Hazel Grace and Augustus.  Green writes with a sort of power that true honesty brings, and this brings his characters to life in ways that have inspired a growing number of people to pick up this book in their own journeys to somehow come to terms with life's tragic qualities and the emerging awareness that life is all too short, especially when tragedy cuts off life in unexpected ways.This book inspires me to remember the part of our human history when plagues and diseases ravaged Europe in the Middle Ages.  That time also produced its own cynicism and despair, captured well by the artists, writers and poets of the time.  It also makes me wonder if there isn't another series of plagues and diseases at work today to grab the attention of so many young people.  Unlike my teenage years, today's teens can no longer be assured that they can go off to a place like school and be safe from someone armed with enough firepower to wipe out several dozen of them.  Nor can they depend on a place like a mall or a movie theater as safe places to go and have fun, when at any moment, some deranged shooter can spray hundreds of bullets their way in a matter of a few minutes.  There are also the broader life-threatening issues to consider--like climate change--which our youth seem to grasp better than we do.  Granted, these are not issues that Hazel Grace or Augustus spend much time wrestling with as they gather with other terminal teens in the Heart of Jesus.  But these are the issues swirling around all of us that may help us all connect with and appreciate the gallows humor wit and sardonic insights of children forced to grow up ahead of time by their suffering and by their impending erasure from the world by a death that looms darker by the day."
2," While not usually one for young adult books, I read John Green's The Fault in our Stars along with my 14-year-old for a summer read. The book has been getting a lot of press (and it is now a movie), and having lost my 6-year-old to cancer 14 months ago, I'm a bit attuned to cancer-related books. However, there are so many bad books out there, I was worried this would trivialize a clearly non-trivial topic.While everyone's experience with cancer is different, Green gets it. Sure, I could argue details and teens with cancer will surely find issues to challenge, but this is believable. What struck me was how much he gets how cancer impacts a community, and especially a family. While the two teenagers, Hazel Grace and Augustus, are the ones dealing with life and death issues of cancer, we also see how their parents and friends handle it. Or don't. Toward the end of the book we hear about all these people showing support on Facebook, but it is clear they have been absent from the daily lives of these teenagers and their families.As a result, and because of newly shared interests, the cancer community creates its own world. For nearly three years our family was part of that community at a Children's Hospital, and when we lost our son, we lost that community. The rest of the world, frankly, just does not get it. Green sees this alienation, sees how families respond, and respects that new world.The title is great, as it a play on Shakespeare's Julius Caesar  where Cassius says to Brutus, The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, / But in ourselves, that we are underlings. Green is saying is that the lives of Hazel Grace and Augustus have been created by outside forces. However, they take that fault and refuse to let the cancer rule their life. Their trip to Amsterdam is a slap in the face of the victim mentality they could assume.Most telling is when Augustus identifies himself with his cancer. What am I at war with? My cancer. And what is my cancer? My cancer is me. The tumors are made of me. They're made of me as surely as my brain and my heart are made of me. It is a civil war, Hazel Grace, with a predetermined winner. This reminded me of the time my oldest son was asking my youngest son with cancer, Oliver, about what kind of robot he would be if he could be a robot. As they talked about the traits, my oldest said, of course, that Oliver's robot would not have cancer. Yes it would, said Oliver. The cancer is part of who I am. In other words, cancer patients begin to live with, and not against, this horrible disease.The book also captures the experience of grief, and I don't think of giving away too much to say that in a book about cancer, there is grief. Hazel Grace describes it as when you are in pain and they ask you to rate it from one to ten. She never said ten. I called it a nine because I was saving my ten. And here it was, the great and terrible ten, slamming me again and again as I lay still and alone in my bed staring a the ceiling, the waves tossing me against the rocks then pulling me back out to sea so they could launch me again into the jagged face of the cliff leaving me floating faceup on the water, undrowned.That is harsh. That is true. And that is why this book is worth reading, whether or not cancer has entered your life. You get a real sense of what it is to live with cancer as a patient and a family. And the cancer community loses people all the time, so they get grief.If any part of the book could be changed, it is a sexual encounter between two teens that could have been avoided. It adds nothing to a connection that is already there, and does not send the best message to teenagers (call me a prude, but there are other options in life).As a parent who has lost a child, the book had me early on, when Hazel Grace (who narrates the book) says: There is only one thing in this world s***tier than biting it from cancer when you're sixteen, and that's have a kid who bites it from cancer.Not my words, but my feelings."
5," When I first heard all the buzz about this book, I figured it was just another poorly-written, weakly-plotted, teenage romance novel with cardboard characters and no depth; the Twilight series without the vampires and gore. I guessed it was a book targeted to an audience of naïve teenagers (and this is not meant to be an insult to all teenagers), who had no literary sense and no expectations. Well, I'm about to eat my words (more accurately, confess to my rash judgment).First of all, I am the most unlikely person to read such a book for a number of reasons. 1) I am 67 years old, and 2) I am a published novelist who writes adult mystery/thrillers. Simply stated, The Fault in Our Stars is a literary masterpiece. I have read literally hundreds of books of every genre and every topic you could possibly imagine and rarely have I felt so much intimacy with the main characters, Hazel Grace and Augustus. They are so well developed and so real, particularly Hazel, that by the end of the book I actually loved them.How John Green was able to create two characters so vividly, so accurately teenage-like, is a credit to his literary genius. A writer's number one job is to evoke emotions in his or her readers. And Mr. Green checked all of my boxes. He had me laughing and crying, which, for me, is a truly rare occurrence. I felt deep sadness, joy, empathy, love, and hate (for what cancer does to people).By design, I am a very slow reader because I read as a writer, not a reader, so I critique as I turn pages. It generally takes me two weeks to read a full-length novel; I read this book in two days. And even though it broke my heart, I think I will read it again and again. Hazel Grace and Augustus have enriched my life and taught me some very important lessons. Mr. Green, thank you for writing such a powerful story."
4," don't often write reviews for books, because I often can't easily sum up my reactions to them. I have the exact same feeling about this book, but it moved me so greatly that it begged a review. So here I go...When I first heard about this book I thought it was going to be some run-of-the-mill story involving superficial teenage emotions and 'puppy love'. Therefore, after perusing a couple of reviews prior to my reading of the novel, I was a bit dubious about the claims of how this book had brought so many people to tears. I, honestly, am often deeply touched by poignant books, but I am rarely, if ever, brought to tears by them. And so, with all of these doubts in mind, I proceeded to read The Fault in Our Stars.After the first few chapters--although captivated by the story--I still doubted its ability to draw tears. I did, however, continue reading due to the quirky narrative of Hazel Grace and the sheer sense of endearment I slowly grew toward the characters, specifically Hazel and Augustus. The story gradually enticed my laughter, my pity, and my heartfelt warmth out into the open; it just sort of weaved its way into my heart.And then it happened. (don't worry, no spoilers: I wouldn't want to ruin such a marvellous tale for those who haven't read it) Once my heart was fully interwoven, it got torn apart--beautifully, tragically. This book drew the tears I was so doubtful of and more. There were times where the words on the page became mere blurs, and I had to wipe my eyes to continue. Soon every page became worth its weight in tears; it was devastating and yet utterly beautiful.This is a story of love, heartbreak, life, death, illness, and all the other little intricacies of teenage life sewn together into a wonderfully stirring and eloquent novel.For those of you who are as doubtful as I was, do yourself a favour and read this astonishing book. Seriously, it even moved me enough to write this essay about my reaction. I have no doubt left, and therefore this receives a full 5 stars from me. Brilliant."
5," Three words: I LOVED THIS BOOK!!Okay, so that was technically four words, but whatever.  This was the first ever John Green book that I have read and it was amazing!Characters-The characters were well developed, and I just loved Hazel and Augustus!  They went through so much, but yet they are so funny and high spirited.  They weren't ones to drown in self pity, and despair.  Nope, not at all.  Instead they live through it and go on with their everyday life,  and they are also very humorous, and caring.I am not saying that they are okay with having cancer or missing a leg, because they aren't okay with it.  They also want a normal life as can be without so much problems, but they do have these problems and they deal with it as best as they can.  I loved how they turned even the worst situations into humorous ones, and found a way to laugh even when the situation was so bleak.As for the supporting characters, Issac was my favorite!  He was just so funny, and caring.  You could tell that he and Augustus were really good best friends.  The other characters, mainly Hazel's and Augustus's parents were also developed very well, and I loved how I could understand their point of view and how they felt about the whole situation just from their actions and dialogues.John Green has a way of writing all the characters in such a way, that you can feel what all the other characters besides Hazel and Augustus, are going through and how they feel without having to read the story from their perspective.  To me, that was very good writing and it made the story ten times better.Main plot/ Resolution-I would be lying if I said that I loved the twist John Green brought upon the characters, and how everything turned out at the end, because I really didn't.  I hated it, and it broke my heart reading all the pages from the point where everything starts going downhill, until the very last page.  I just hated it, and by the time I finally finished reading the book, I was a crying my eyes out.However, at the same time I would also by lying if I said that I truly did hate the main plot and resolution, because that's also not true.Truth be told, I actually thought the plot twist was brilliant, and even if the ending was totally not the way I would have liked things to have turned out, it was still really good.  But my main reason for still loving this book so much, despite it breaking my heart and making me cry was because it stayed realistic to life, even though the book is fiction.  It was a perfect portrayal of how life is not perfect, and how things can drastically change and go downhill in a matter of seconds.As a reader and fan of this book, I really cared about the characters and hated that they all had to go through so much suffering and pain.  But in the end, I loved how the overall story portrayed life and death, and how life is not perfect for some people, and how things can change for the better or worse at any point in people's lives.The plot twist in this book was bitter, and the ending even worse, but it was also the best, and part of what made this book a favorite of mine.  Overall, the plot and resolution of this book was imperfectly perfect and just what the book needed to make it such a big success.Overall Thoughts-The Fault In Our Stars is a must read!But be warned, if you decide to read this book you will most definitely cry!  However, that shouldn't stop you from reading this book because it really is one of the best books you might ever read.The story is unique and bittersweet, but at the same time really funny and heartbreaking.  You will be able to feel and connect with all the characters, and not just Hazel, even though the book is from her point of view.  The only reason I gave this book a rating of 5.5 / 5 instead of a 6 is because I felt that the beginning portion of this book was kind of slow at times, but once you get past that, the book is truly amazing!Seriously, I know I am repeating myself here, but if you haven't read the book yet, you really should because it is one of the best books!"
5," SPOILERS. AHEAD. WILL. RUIN. THE. BOOK.Okay. With that said.Whenever we go on a road trip, I buy a book to read on the way there. A couple weeks ago, some of my friends recommended The Fault in Our Stars to me. I’d actually seen it on the Kindle Bestsellers list about a year ago, but back then it sounded like one of those long, boring preachy-type books that like to tell you what to do with your life. So I ignored it. But I’d actually heard that The Fault in Our Stars movie was coming out soon, because I read Veronica Roth’s blog, and she’d written a post on how Shailene Woodley was cutting her hair to prepare for her role as Hazel in The Fault in Our Stars.Now, let me tell you something: I really, really, REALLY am annoyed when people start reading a book just because it’s coming out as a movie. I know that it is one of the major ways a larger audience gets to know about the book in the first place, but still. Well, I guess what REALLY, REALLY, REALLY irks me is when somebody reads a book because they’ve heard the movie is coming out and then say, “OMG, THIS IS THE BEST BOOK I’VE EVER READ, IT’S MY FAVORITE. I’M SUCH A HARDCORE AND DEDICATED FAN TO THIS AUTHOR!!!! I KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT EVERYTHING HE/SHE HAS EVER WRITTEN!!!!!!!” I truly do understand (I truly, truly, truly do) that sometimes, people get to know about an author when the movie is being publicized. And they read the book and think that it’s really good. And it really, truly is their favorite book. But the part that annoys me is when they announce that they are a hardcore, dedicated fan to the author and his/her works.I mean, there are always people who have been fans LONGER, who have done their research, who have LITERALLY READ all the books written by the author, whose LIFE DREAM is to discuss the books with the author. I just feel wrong kind of taking their dream away from them by reading the book just when it comes out as a movie. To tell you the truth, I felt bad I had waited so long (and it had to come to it being made into a MOVIE) for me to read The Fault in Our Stars. But anyways. Onwards.The Fault in Our Stars was the first good book I’d read in a long time. I mean, you read books like Divergent and The Hunger Games, and they’re so popular, but (at least, for me), you can’t see WHY. For a book to be good to me, I need to be able to read it once and see what made it a bestseller. The Fault in Our Stars was like that. I could feel what Hazel felt, something I hadn’t done with a book in a long time. When characters died, and the main character felt sad, even when it was narrated in first-person, I just thought, “Okay, so so-and-so died. And that made (insert main character’s name here) sad. Moving on.” But I could really feel it when things happened in The Fault in Our Stars. I could literally feel my heart puncturing when (coughspoilercough) Augustus died, and for once, I could actually understand why the character felt the way she did.Half the time, The Fault in Our Stars made me feel like, “Okay, if someone else had written a book about cancer kids falling in love, that would’ve sold just as good as this,” but after Gus’s death, I could really understand why The Fault in Our Stars was so special, what made it such a bestseller.It actually stymied my creative flow a little, which is unusual for a book. Only the really good books get my creative flow to stop or get me to write just like the author does.After finishing the book, I just kept on thinking, over and over, Why did Augustus have to die? Why did John Green have to kill him? Just over, and over, and over.There’s a simple reason behind this: because it made a good book.But the irrational part of me still doesn’t understand that.I think when a death happens in a book—especially the death of one of the central characters—it has to be well-executed.About two months ago, I read Allegiant, the last book of the Divergent trilogy (I’ve actually been meaning to post my thoughts on that… oh, well). At the very end of the book, the main character, Tris Prior, dies. I completely respect the author’s decision to let her character die; after all, it was never my decision; but I was really dissatisfied by the way she did die.(MAJOR SPOILER) At the end of the book, Tris essentially survives a room full of poison, choosing to go so her brother won’t have to die. However, even though Tris HAS HER WEAPON with her, she dies by being shot by an untrained man. I was, first of all, dissatisfied with her death because of the fact that it went against all aspects of her character. Tris has an amazing will to live, but at the end of the series, she doesn’t even try to fight back, even though she can plausibly do so. Also, the situation of the death seems to promote suicide in teens, which is never a good thing.However, Augustus has no choice over whether or not he gets to die. In fact, he wants to live. He wants to do something with his life, not just be a cancer kid, stuck sick at home. But he dies anyway, and he has no choice over it. The execution of his death, the way it was put into writing, was simply done better than Tris’s death was done, and I think that that was why it left a more profound effect on me. While I still wanted Augustus to be alive, I also respected and understood his death.So there you have it. My take on The Fault in Our Stars with major spoilers and weird rants."
5," http://jukeboxmuse.com/2014/07/01/waxing-poetic-were-all-romantics-at-heart/Here we are again with one of those hyped-up books and one of those cult followings and one of those movies. I wonder if original movie ideas actually exist anymore (Planes 2? Really Pixar?). Putting all originality complaints aside, this book-to-movie adaptation is actually worth discussing.The question I always ask first with what I’m beginning to call “hype books” is whether John Green and TFIOS really deserve all the publicity versus other books that weren’t lucky enough to get a movie, like Joan Bauer or Sarah Dessen‘s veritable treasure trove of realistic fiction. Of course I’m not going to say it deserves ALL the social media buzz, because when teenage girls and a hot male lead who waxes poetic get involved, everything always get way crazy (remember Team Edward and Jacob? It never stops). However, Green is quickly building a legacy for himself that deserves to be lauded alongside Joan Bauer and Sarah Dessen.Plus, he’s a boss. Green didn’t get famous overnight after his first stab at writing. TFIOS may be his jackpot, but he’s well used to writing successful books: Paper Towns and Will Grayson, Will Grayson are both on my TBR list. As if that wasn’t enough, he’s also a youtube giant who started VidCon.With Green’s online presence in mind, it’s not surprising that TFIOS got so popular so quickly. And the story is attractively Nicholas-Sparks-like: Hazel, a 16-year old cancer patient meets 17-year old Augustus at cancer support group and they go to Amsterdam to meet a reclusive author and fall in love along the way. I won’t say what comes next, but c’mon guys, it’s a sad cancer story, you have to go into this novel with some expectation of being depressed. I certainly was pleasantly mopey for a couple days after finishing the book. And I caught myself imagining what Hazel’s life would be like after the book ended. It’s always a good sign when we want to continue a story in our own heads.The difference between this book and the annoyingly sappy, repetitive Nicholas Sparks books is the hilarious dialogue. John Green puts so much of himself in all his characters, and in this case it works well. Green is a smart and quirky guy, therefore his characters have smart and quirky dialogue. The constant comments about the awkward, face-palm moments in life make the book flow naturally and feel realistic. However, the dialogue is also Green’s Achilles heel. There were many times when I was jolted out of the story because the dialogue had turned into a slew of pretentiously mature witticisms. That’s the danger zone: trying to be smart and funny while still making readers believe people actually talk like that in real life. The simple test is whether the dialogue can be read out loud in a convincing manner. I understand that Augustus’s outrageous one-liners are deliberately outrageous and he probably practices his speeches in front of a mirror, but there’s only so much Green can include of Augustus waxing poetic before it makes me cringe.And while I don’t want to bash John Green too hard because I do think he’s created some quietly hilarious characters, I have to mention the first kiss scene while we’re on the subject of plausibility. I can deal with the improv kiss because emotions are just too overwhelming sometimes, but why must we have the important first physical connection in Anne Frank’s house (aka memorial of a 13-year old victim of the Holocaust)? With people clapping afterwards?? I’m sorry, but that’s really not how real life works. It would be fine if Green didn’t try so hard for the rest of the book to be a teenager’s realistic life, but the appeal of his book is that these kids are just like us. And while it’d be cool to have an audience applauding me after every major relationship checkpoint, that sadly hasn’t happened to me yet.I only call out the occasional pretentious dialogue and that one ridiculous scene because it’s out of place in an otherwise perfectly flawed story. Hazel, quiet and sympathetic, and Augustus, wonderfully over-the-top, work well as the modern star-crossed couple. The few appearances of Hazel’s parents, who act as both supportive parents and best friends with their only daughter, were a close second to the main couple’s relationship. All in all, I thought the book was too short. John Green left me wanting more. Which is fitting, for a love story between terminal cancer patients and a moral about how fleeting life can be. I was stumped for a while on whether Green treated the effect of cancer on a teenager’s life too simply, but in the end I guess the book’s about struggling to have a life with cancer, not struggling to beat cancer while having a life.Contrary to the book, I have no major complaints about the movie, a surprise to both you and me, I bet. I liked the characters of Hazel (played by Shailene Woodley) and Hazel’s parents (Laura Dern and Sam Trammell) even more, and I appreciate Ansel Elgort’s ability to toss off Green’s pretentious dialogue as fake douchebaggery. It still doesn’t fly in the book, but it’s endearing in the movie. Gosh, Hazel and Gus have such great chemistry, considering that the actors played siblings in their previous movie, Divergent. There was a never a point in the movie where I lost focus or checked the time, thanks mostly to Shailene and Ansel’s impressive range of facial expressions. Plus, the voiceover was tastefully used to preserve Hazel’s first-person narrative. The movie did skip a lot of Gus’s health slowly deteriorating after the Amsterdam trip, but one has to make cuts somewhere in order to get the full immersive effect of other, more important scenes. It really was an incredibly faithful representation of the novel. So faithful that the first kiss scene was just as fairy-tale-like in the flesh as I imagined it to be.It was a long, fulfilling movie. What felt like six hours was probably only two. It alleviated my worries about the book being too short to create enough depth in Hazel and Gus’s relationship and treating cancer too simply. It felt like a life had been lived, and that’s all we really ask for.Rating: 8 - loved it: would definitely recommend, solid characters, writing, plot; might reread in a couple yearsThe movie soundtrack is worth a quick listen too. As individual songs, Birdy’s “Not About Angels”, M83′s  “Wait”, and STRFKR’s “While I’m Alive” stand out to me. The rest are a little to generically pop for my tastes. Regarding it as a whole, the collection of young artists delivers a fresh sound, representing the ups and downs of the story in all its teenage glory."
5," really didn't want to have to review this book because I was conflicted while reading this book. I wanted to like it more than I did, and on some levels, I really did enjoy it and found it to be quite insightful. Then, in hindsight, I found myself annoyed by how contrived the bulk of it is.I find most books with young adults to conquer them in unrealistic ways. As the father of a teenage girl, I can attest to the fact that kids rarely--if ever--talk like Hazel and Gus, and I have yet to meet one who can make observations on the same level as these characters. If I was wrong, you'd very likely find a large number of books written by teenagers. I get that to make the plot move and the metaphors strong, someone needs to make these observations, but it just doesn't work. It took me out of the story because I just couldn't buy it. A story that tries to conquer subject matter as serious as cancer is going to move me if it portrays life as it is. On some levels, this book does this. It doesn't strive to portray life with a happy ending, but it cheats to make that point. It forces the point home by using the voice of characters mature beyond their years to make it. I feel like this book might have been more effective without the mature observations that are supposed to come across as clever, but only feel fabricated. It becomes every more annoying whenever our duo interacts with adults. They're always so much deeper, so much smarter...so much more everything that kids this age usually are not.I don't want to take away from the story. It's a good one and strives to make a good point. In fact, a lot of the cleverness of Hazel and Gus actually is pretty interesting and insightful, but it doesn't change the fact that if I write a book about a six year old who invents the next reliable source of energy, no matter how well I write it, it doesn't change how unreal it would be. That's how I felt about this book."
4," So I know that I am a little late jumping on this bandwagon, and that so many people are going to be unhappy with my review. Just please keep in mind that it is just my opinion.This is a love story between two sick teenagers, Hazel and Gus. It tells of how they met during a support group, both suffering from disease. Hazel is terminal and Gus seems to be cancer free and no worse for the wear other than being an amputee. Hazel shares her obsession of her favorite book with Gus. The book is the story of a young girl that suffers from a terminal illness as well, Hazel has been frustrated for some time regarding the way that this story ends and has tried a number of times to reach out to the author, who has become a recluse in Amsterdam, to which she has not gotten any responses. Gus does finally have some luck getting in contact with the author through his assistant and they are both invited to Amsterdam. They make the trip with the help of the wish program, where they fall in love and Hazel learns that Gus' health is not as good as she thought that it was. The rest of the book contains the struggles while Gus goes down hill.I was worried to read this book because I was afraid of the emotional response that it would cause. Several people I know, many who have similar tastes in books that I do, absolutely LOVED this book. Unfortunately, I really had no emotional response what-so-ever, I did not hate this book, but I did not love it either. It was a sweet story and the idea behind it was great. I did not get moved by the character development and felt that there was just not enough substance to the story. Part of my problem with the book may have been all of the hype that has surrounded the book, which raised my expectations of the book.Even though this book was not my cup of tea, I definitely see where it is very moving to other people. I say that it is still worth reading if you are interested, just not to get your hopes up for a miraculous piece of literary work."
3," For me, being a 21 year old man, A Fault in Our Stars isn't usually my type of book. I usually stay away from Nicolas Spark Romance type books. Not because I think they're poorly written, but because usually they just don't peak my interest. Most of the time romance novels are far fetched and nearly impossible to believe. In my opinion A Fault in Our Stars follows close to that. I think it can be difficult for anyone not living with cancer to understand this book, akak Me. This isn't some ignorant opinion to say the least. I have read some reviews from people with cancer and without and there seem to be some differences.For me Hazel and Gus are completely unbelievable characters. They do nothing that teenagers do, think the way no teenagers do, and handle situations in ways teenagers wouldn't. Hazel to me comes off as a complainer who rarely finds any joy in life except for Gus. Although I can see the argument on why she is that way and really why she has the right of all people to be that way. But just because you have right does it mean you should act that way? Hazel constantly talks about the negative side of cancer perks, but in my opinion she is one. To me she's a bitch, but the only reason we like her is because we feel sorry for her. I know how that can sound really harsh and the only reason I say it is because I couldn't connect with the character at all. Gus is equally as hard to connect with as well as Issac and even every one of their parents. Hazel's mom tells her to get a life in the beginning that clings to her.If I'm being honest The Fault in Our Stars didn't live up to the hype and I think it should have ended differently. As to not spoil the end I won't give my opinion on how I think it should have ended. This is why I'm giving it three stars."
5," Warning: Contains spoilers.This book was so well written. It is very real, while still giving us an unbelievable love story. John Green writes this in the first person, as a character name Hazel Grace Lancaster, and he gives her the narrative as the sarcastic teenaged girl she is supposed to be. She is a young girl living with cancer, and has an oxygen tank as a constant companion. She is a simple, yet lovely person with a great, sarcastic sense of humor and a caring heart.Hazel is sent to support group by her mother who thinks she is depressed and needs to make friends. This is torturously boring for Hazel until she meets a new face named Augustus Waters, and eighteen year-old with a prosthetic leg. Now is when I tell you that this is the character that I completely fell in love with. Like YA books always do to me, this one made me regret my misspent  youth. If I could go back to my teen years, I would seriously save my heart for a guy like this. He is witty and charismatic, very positive, and sees the true beauty in everything.The love story between Hazel and Gus (I may name my future son this now) is powerful, yet real. They have a devotion and an intense need to protect one another, as well as hold the other up.SPOILER AHEAD........The twist in this book, I actually did see coming, but I still think it was a good move on John Greens part. It was a good way to show how Augustus, who loved Hazel so intensely, really did give her the strength to  endure the realities life with or without cancer can bring us. In tern, she taught him that your life, is only as big as your life, and does not need to be experienced, or remembered world wide to leave a powerful mark.I really enjoyed the way John Green put emotions into words, such as the quote Pain demands to be felt and how Hazel said each time she was in the hospital, she never rated her pain as a 10 as she says, I was saving my 10.This book was so well put together, with enough reality, enough emotion and enough humor to make it enjoyable for me. It is easily making my top ten list of favorite books, which isn't easy because reading is all I do.A Little about the Movie....I could tell just by the trailers that this movie was going to follow the book well enough for me to go see it. I was not sorry. Unlike most film adaptations, this one did the book justice. I have to give praise to Ansel Elgort who played the role of Augustus. He gave an amazing performance and seriously brought Gus to life the way I envisioned him as I read the book. The important parts were left in, and only the parts that could be afforded to be left out were not included. If you're a fan of this book, the movie is definitely worth seeing!"
2," So I finally found the time to read this book, I wanted to for a long time, especially because the movie is coming out soon (by the time I post this review, the movie will be in the cinemas).The story follows Hazel Grace who is a 16 years old cancer patient. In a support group her parents send her to she first meets Isaac and then also his friend Augustus. They become great friends and eventually something deep develops between her and Gus. I love these two together, the chemistry was there from the start and I loved that they were able to talk about everything. It was true love.This book is really funny at times, but it also made me cry a lot. The topic of cancer is difficult and delicate and we get to read about it first hand. Hazel goes through a lot in this book, yet John Green found a great way to write about her life, so that she seemed like every other normal teenager. Then “baam” another surprise jumped out of a page and changed everything.This book is not only about fighting cancer and all the other circumstances this disease intiles, but also about friendship, love and being happy.It was great to read about Hazel reading this book over and over again and connecting to it. The ending is still unclear and then the opportunity to meet the author comes up. Together with her mum and Gus she goes to Amserdam and meets him. Let’s just see the whole journey and the meeting turn out differently than expected.John Green’s writing is different, clever, emotional, refreshing and it really connects the reader into the story. The book left me wanting more and it will definitely stay with me…The perfect mixture between humour/happiness and tragedy/sadness. Keep your tissues ready."
5," Although it is not mentioned within the book itself, one fellow reviewer offers this as the likely inspiration behind the title of this book. The fault, dear Brutus is not in our stars, / But in ourselves, that we are underlings. Caesar (I, ii, 140-141)This book is both a love story and a reminder of the fragility of life. Hazel is a sixteen year old who isn’t like other teenagers. She is a non-traditional student and cancer patient that requires nearly constant oxygen assistance for her weak lungs. At her parents’ insistence she attends a weekly cancer survival group meeting where she meets several acquaintences that don’t really become friends until the arrival of seventeen year old Augustus, also a cancer survivor. Hazel and Augustus develop a friendship that quickly turns romantic, even though the motions of normal romanticism are new and scary for the both of them due to their fragile health conditions. The support group friends try to find some sense of normalcy in a life that is far from what normal teenagers lead. One review states that they are intelligent beyond their age. While I am not a cancer victim, I believe that they are not so much more intelligent as they are mature because they are forced to deal with the realization that they are not infallible teenagers at a much younger age than “normal” kids. Instead of dealing with the all-important teen decisions of what to wear tomorrow, these kids are dealing with “How long will I live? Does my life have any meaning? Does my death have any meaning? How will I be remembered when I am gone?” Don’t get me wrong, they do still worry about silly teenager stuff but the importance on such matters is quite muted, understandibly. And an intelligent reader will appreciate the complexity of these characters and what they are dealing with. Hazel continues to have a friendship with one of her former traditional school buddies but finds the relationship quite difficult to maintain due to their lack of commonality. One of their support group friends has cancer in his eyes and they try to help him deal with the impending removal of his eyes and sights forever at such a young age. Hazel shares her love of a novel about a cancer victim with Augustus, and both embark upon a quest to find its elusive author to ask him burning questions about the story’s conclusion.  Their journey takes them to Amsterdam which in itself is a feat, due especially to Hazel’s frail lungs. I don’t want to give away what they discover in Amsterdam, nor how life plays out for Hazel and Augustus, as that is for the reader to find out. But suffice it to say, you will be sad, you will be inspired, and you will need a few tissues. Although most would claim this is young adult fiction I dare say that any parent or adult will find this equally as poignant as a teenager because we all know someone that is or has been affected by cancer and this give us a little glimpse into their world. Lest you think this isn’t a book for adults to appreciate, let me share some of the best quotes from the book….“You have a choice in this world, I believe, about how to tell sad stories, and we made the funny choice.”“I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once.”“Some tourists think Amsterdam is a city of sin, but in truth it is a city of freedom. And in freedom, most people find sin.”“You don’t get to choose if you get hurt in this world, old man, but you do have some say in who hurts you. I like my choices. I hope she likes hers.”“You are so busy being you that you have no idea how utterly unprecedented you are.” Now that this book is a movie I’m going to take a stab that the last quote and the young couple’s relationship is what is focused on in the film, though to be honest I have not yet seen the movie. I’m sure I eventually will but I’m usually disappointed with the film adaptations of books. Nobody, however, should be disappointed in this book."
5," For some reason, there seem to be a lot of YA books with cancer as a major plot point, to the point where to me it seems almost as cliche as needless angsting, pointless romantic age-inappropriate melodrama and dead/divorced parents. I was told by many friends that this book was amazing, even capable of making a person cry the whole way through. That did not happen for me, because I never can bring myself to show thatlevel of emotion from a book. I went in expecting a nonstop humorless tearjerker with nary a glimmer of hope to be found. Instead, I found something actually enjoyable and even relatable. From the start I noticed that the teenagers talk and act like actual teenagers talk and act, even if Augustus Waters speaks not like a human being but a philosophy textbook with all the non-profound parts cut out, and, like Isaac said, could not take a piss without musing about the deep philosophical resonances of human waste. Thankfully, this is an intended character trait, not a writing mishap or worse, an attempt to create a character whose sole purpose is to soapbox all of the author's various opinions on life, the universe and everything (an Author Avatar, if you will). Moreover, in TFIOS, cancer is not just an informed trait used to get the audience to sympathize with the character but has no ill effects other than being Newberry-bait (a Littlest Cancer Patient, if you will), but a complex, life changing, life threatening, surprisingly common malady that affects the plot in ways other than faking profoundness, a quality that TFIOS legitimately has. It tackles many deep issues, like love, loss, inevitability of death, greatness, our impact on the world, and other such things, all without getting too preachy about it. The characterization is amazing as well; In the end, I found myself sympathizing with every named character - even Van Houten. The plot had perfectly logical progression. The descriptions are splendid yet not at the point where the prose hampers the story with its magnitude and grandeur. There are many ways this story is magnificent, so many that I cannot list them all here, so I simply will say that TFIOS is magnificent. It made me chuckle, it made me almost feel emotion, and it was a fun tale full of insight about humanity. Overall, TFIOS gets 5 stars, for exceeding my expectations and being a truly moving experience, especially coming from a truly unmoveable person."
5," To each his own.I found this story to be strangely interesting despite the fact that nothing was extraordinary about it. It was a love story, yes. However, for those of you who hate romance stories, like myself, this might still be a good alternative. I don't really like romance books especially because they are very unrealistic. This story however, tackled real life issues.Hazel has been left requiring the use of an oxygen tank after her thyroid cancer spreads to her lungs. Her parents believe that she is depressed and nags her to go to support group where she eventually meets another cancer child (Augustus), who is friends with someone from her support group (Isaac). She tells herself although he is handsome and they like each other very much that she will not let him get attached and that she doesn't want him to be devastated by her eventual death. She let's him read this book (her favourite) and they both then embark on a mission to find out what happens next because they book ends in the middle of a sentence.It tackles the issue of knowing that you're going to die sooner rather than later. While reading this it made me think, if I was going to die soon, what would I do with my life? In Hazel's case; should she fall in love with him? Should she let him fall in love with her? Is it fair to do this? Is it worth it? In Augustus' case; how do I leave behind a legacy? How big a legacy is required to be significantly remembered? Will it really matter? How Important is it to leave behind some grand legacy?To me it was a reminder that, you only get until you die to be happy and to make your mark. But it's hard to think what you want that mark to be. Knowing you don't have much time left changes many things. If you're not sick you can't really quit your job and go to Amsterdam or Paris or Rome. But you can make the people who will remember you someday, remember you as the best person you could have been."
5," Hazel straps on her oxygen and prepares for another lengthy session in her cancer survivor group. She dreads these meetings, but today is different. She meets someone new: Gus. Before she knows it, Hazel is sharing books and swapping stories with Gus. They quickly bond over Hazel's favorite book, written by an elusive man who lives in Holland. Gus insists that they must meet this author and find out what happened to the characters after the book ends. Gus uses his wish and soon the two of them are on a life changing adventure. What happens when fate collides with love?What I Liked:*At last, I finally had the courage to tackle The Fault Within the Stars. I have long been putting off this read because of the subject matter: cancer. Who wants to read a book about teenage kids with cancer? Plenty of people that's for sure. After finishing, I can say that this book is well written, thought provoking, and I thought the author handled the cancer beautifully. If you are like me and have been afraid of this one, don't be. Mr. Green does an excellent job of engaging you with intelligent and precocious characters who use humor to detract from the big ugly c word.*Let's talk about the elephant in the room: cancer. I am not a reader who enjoys reading emotional books especially when it comes to illness. I appreciated that Mr. Green didn't make the book all doom and gloom. There was plenty of humor sprinkled in to lighten up the mood, and I liked that he found a good balance between the dark and the depressing and the bright side. Yes, there are plenty of things that will break your heart, but there are also lots of things that will make you smile.*This is a completely character driven story. Hazel and Augustus are two characters whom you can't help but fall in love with. They are both fighters and survivors who come together and love, live and laugh in the face of cancer. Their intelligent dialogue made me laugh. I loved them both, and I liked their relationship. There is also a strong secondary cast of characters. I especially liked Isaac. His situation was tough and heart breaking, but I liked how he came through it and was able to joke about his condition. Hazel's parents are very much involved in the story and they play a big role in the story. I liked that the parents had strong roles and I loved seeing how they handled everything. All in all, the characters are top notch and realistic.*The ending... yes it is sad and you will likely shed a few tears, but I also liked that it had a positive message, and it spoke strongly to me. Life is short, take advantage of each day you have and don't take anything for granted.And The Not So Much:*I couldn't help but feel a tiny bit disappointed. I don't know if it was because of all the hype and expectation or my mood or what, but I didn't think this had the strong emotional impact I was expecting. I don't know, I think too much time was wasted on the weird author whom I could care less about.*Speaking of the eccentric author, I didn't really get why there was such a strong focus on him. Hazel and Augustus fly to Holland to meet his whack job and he ends up being a horrible drunk. I kept expecting some big break through or redeeming moment with him, but I ended up being disappointed.I thought the whole thing with the eulogy was weird. Why would Gus involve the author after his horrid behavior? I thought it was a bit unrealistic.*The book is open ended. I guess I just wanted a bit more closure with both Hazel and Isaac. After the emotional upheaval I wanted to know that they would be okay.The Fault in the Stars is a book that tugs at your heart strings. It will make you laugh and then cry. It is an emotional journey worth taking. I thought the writing was excellent and the story was solid. Definitely a book you should read. I know it took me a long time to get around to it as I was afraid, but I can honestly say that it wasn't as gut wrenching or sad as I expected. I appreciated that the author packs in lots of humor to help lighten the load. If you are avoiding this book, don't hesitate, read it.Favorite Quotations:The dead are visible only in terrible lidless eye of memory. The living, thank heaven, retain the ability to surprise and to disappoint.As he read, I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once.I'm in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will shallow the only earth we'll ever have, and I am in love with you.I borrowed a copy of this book from the library. All opinions are my own and I was not compensated for this review.Posted@Rainy Day Ramblings."
5," have never been as affected by a book, as I was with this one. When I finished it (and I tore through this book in a matter of hours, not because it's short or anything, because it's not, but because I could not put it down), I sat back and cried. I have never cried over a book before, until this book.It wasn't just sad because it's a book about children with cancer, which is a sad thing already. It explores what it means to be alive, what it means to love, and what it means to lose, peppered with witty banter and sarcastic remarks throughout. It is such a complete book. The author, John Green, plucks his readers from reality and drops them into this new reality, complete with minute details that only serve the purpose of fleshing out the book's world and amazing points of view that people who aren't facing down a terminal illness would never experience otherwise. Hazel and Gus are just so blase about their cancer too; it's a thing that exists and there's really nothing they can do about it, except hope that the next round of experimental drugs turns out to be less poisonous than the actual cancer, and they actually manage to put the cancer on the back burner. This isn't a book about two kids who are, essentially, made of cancer (quote from the book). It's a book about two kids who meet and realize they have a lot in common (including wicked senses of humor and the sharpest of tongues), sharing their favorite books and video games with each other, admitting secret fears that come with having a terminal illness, and eventually setting off on a whirlwind adventure across the Atlantic. Instead of being crushed under the depression that comes with cancer, they choose to take a more cynical and sarcastic view of the world (because why the hell not?). They choose to be realistic with themselves and their friends and families.This is an incredible book that I feel everyone should read. If you've been hesitant to get this book, please stop hesitating and just get it. Many other reviewers have posted that it's not good and isn't worth your time, but it absolutely is."
4," This is the first John Green book I’ve read, though I’ve wanted to read him for a long time. You know the phrase, so many books, so little time…anyway, I HAD to read it before I saw the movie, so it was time and here are my thoughts:I thoroughly enjoyed the characters in this book. Green writes them very well, they are unique, and descriptive and you truly get a feel for what they are going through. Both sets of parents, Augustus’ and Hazel’s have just the right balance of strong, yet on-the-brink-of-breaking-down. I love that her father is the sensitive one. I think we often see fathers as being the strong and unemotional, but the truth is, they can be as vulnerable and expressive as their female counterparts.I adored Hazel and Augustus and found their relationship sweet and affecting. I loved their silly banter, their quick wits, and sarcasm. They are actually much like me, which I liked.  Couple things that bugged me, both of them had odd names. There are just not many Hazels and Augustus’ out there anymore. Their vocabulary both in dialogue and internally seemed WAY over their heads. I understand the wisdom of the dying youth, and the fact that these two are incredibly intelligent, but I still don’t think teenagers would talk and think the way they do at times. Sometimes yes. As often as they do? No.  Also the calling each other by full names and first and middle names cute at first, but through the whole book, a little irritating. And the over use of “um.” Um? That’s just my ticky tacky stuff.This brings me to Green’s writing skills, I think he is an amazing and beautiful writer. He makes putting words to paper look effortless and seamless, which, as a writer, I know it is not. It’s obvious he took a great amount of time to research the subject matters spoken of in this book , i.e. cancer, treatments, Amsterdam, and it felt like they mattered to him.I guess I’m among the minority that found the story just good and not earth-shattering. I liked it yes, I’m not sure I loved it. I’m not a big crier when I read, and I did not cry while reading this either. The only time I remember getting a little emotional is when Hazel spoke to her mom about not being a mom anymore.  There are books that have resonated with me more.However, as I said before, I liked the book, I loved the characters, John Green’s writing is impressive, the storyline, noble. I will read the other John Green books on my shelf. This would be a 3.5 for me, but Amazon doesn't allow 3.5 so I'd rather up it than down it.Do I recommend it? Yes. If you like books about cancer, books that make you cry, books like Deadline by Chris Crutcher, Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher, The Pull of Gravity by Gae Polisner and any other of John Green’s books."
5," After seeing a trailer for the movie, I knew I had to read The Fault in Our Stars because I'm one of those that NEEDS to read the book first. A few friends of mine had already read it and all warned me to be prepared to cry.Surprisingly, I did not.The author has set out a tragic tale--a coming-of-age love story involving a terminally ill young woman and a young man in remission. Surrounded by a cast of hapless characters (including a nutless social worker, an alcoholic author, a hyper-emotional dad, and a hovering mom) they share some incredible experiences and some even more incredible conversations. The dialogue throughout the book is witty and laugh-out-loud funny, despite the ominous storyline. And when I wasn't chuckling at the funny parts (which was honestly about 75% of the book), I felt uplifted by the more somber parts. The author did an amazing job of injecting as much levity as possible to some very serious topics.The teen-aged characters (including Hazel's and Gus's friend Isaac from support group) were mature beyond their years and brought up some hauntingly honest truths about love, life, and dying. And though this book has been billed as a Young Adult novel, I think it'll will speak to a variety of people. It'll resonate with teenagers who are trying to find where they fit in and anyone who enjoys a love story. Parents who have lost (or fear losing) a child will relate. And anyone who is dealing (or has ever dealt) with loss will take something from this story.A warning for the more conservative reader...there's some PG-13 language sprinkled throughout the book as well as a couple of references to underage drinking and sexual activity. None of these things, though, stick out as inappropriate at the times they occur."
4," Can I just get some ice cream, a box of tissues and a trashcan?This story blew my mind! I mean it had me in true tears under my throw on my bed. I completely love this book. This is my second time reading one of John Green's book and I was hesitant because the first book I read was not that good to me, but enjoyable so I went into this book with little expectation thinking I wouldn't enjoy it, but I was totally wrong.This follows the life of Hazel and Augustus, two teens with cancer. It does sound grim at first, but this was far from grim. Hazel's character was absolutely adorable. Despite having thyroid cancer she still wanted to live a normal life. She wanted to do things others did and be treated equally. More so, she wanted to die when the time came and didn't want her parents to do anything but let her go.Augustus started off as a chipper character: very outgoing, making jokes, keeping people on their toes, but that was his way of deflecting his own issue with osteosarcoma. Despite being healthy for a while, he went back into getting sick after doing the sweetest thing for Hazel.The way Hazel and Augustus became a couple was truly cute because it wasn't instalove. They took the time to get to know each other and do simple things for one another that made each other smile. I think when they both got sick (Hazel before Europe and Augustus after) they didn't want each other to see each other sick and weak. That spoke volumes, but still was heartfelt.As the story got closer the end I was in shock by the twist and turn and it took. The person I thought would die totally wasn't the one and I just cried my eyes out. Augustus is super sweet, kind, loving, friendly and caring in so many ways. Hazel was just trying to live her days until it was her time to go.Another character that I feel was essential to this story was Isaac. He had eye cancer and eventually through surgery he would become blind, but cancer free. His girlfriend truly pissed me off and made me want to jump through the pages and strangle her, but thankfully he had friends like Hazel and Augustus to pull him through.This is definitely the type of book one needs to read if they want a different outlook on life or just want a heartfelt story to read. Just be prepared with your box of tissue and trashcan.Next thing to do: go watch the movie!"
5," originally gave this book 5 starts, but I'm giving it 4 now.It took me a long time to decide to review this book. I loved it when I read it and I still do. What's not to love? This is the perfect book! It has wonderful characters, a great story ans is magnificently written. It's hard not to like it.How can you not like to read about two teenagers that at such young age are struggling for their lives knowing that theirs is a lost battle (as are all battles against death)? How can you not be moved by their relationship? How can you not be dazzled by the story?You can't. Well, at least I couldn't. But it bothered me. There was something about this book that just didn't settle with me and it took me ages to understand what it was, because this book seemed to be the perfect book.And it is! This is the perfect book. It has everything. It is a very intelligent book, well written and with so much heart! I once heard a famous Hong Kong writer saying that to be a writer you have to sell your heart and when I read this book I remember thinking that John Green must have sold all his family's hearts to write this book.So where is the fault to me?Well, I came to the conclusion that the book did not have faults and right there was the fault with it. It has no faults...it has no soul! At least not to me. I like a book where I can relate with the Author. Where I can see a glimpse of the writer's soul, the writer's thoughts, struggles, beliefs. Like when you eat your mother's food and it has the special taste that you would recognize even if you were in Japan, because it has soul.John Green poured is heart in the book, but not his soul. It's still a wonderful book, but the fifth star? I take it back."
2," Firstly, I would like to say that I am not very good with words so please forgive me if this review is written very poorly or if it is hard to follow.Secondly, I would like to mention all the people who have read this book and hated it. I have read some of the reviews and the problem that a lot of people had with the book was the fact that Hazel and Augustus weren't realistic enough and that they didn't speak like an average teenager speaks. I am just going to say that John Green acknowledged this by having Augustus's dad say to Hazel's parents, Our children our weird. after both Hazel and Augustus rant on about a topic that I can't remember at the moment. Also, I will remind you all that Hazel, was, infact, a college student. Both characters were highly intelligent and intellectual and weren't obsessed with small things, like Starbucks and TV for example. Believe it or not, there are some teenagers who are very good with words.Another problem I have heard of people having with this book, and, in this case, John Green as well, is that John Green romanticized cancer. I don't believe this to be true in the slightest. I believe that with this novel, John Green in now way downgraded cancer or anything about it. If he wanted to do that, I'm sure Hazel and Augustus would have both beaten their cancer and lived happily ever after and enjoyed their cancer free lives. But, we all know that didn't happen. I feel that John Green opened peoples eyes to teens living cancer without making the book about cancer. He created a beautiful love story about two teenagers who just so happen to have cancer. This book was real. People were sick. People were blind. People were hospitalized. People were douches. People were happy.People were hurt. People lived. People died. People were REAL. What more do you want from a book? Real. I don't know about anyone else but the books I love most are the books that make me feel like there is someone that I have to know, that there is someone who has to know me. When I finished this book, I felt that Hazel needed someone to talk to, and for one insane moment, I thought, Maybe I can find her and talk to her. For one moment, Hazel was real. For one moment, the book was real. What more is there to ask for?Now, with the opinions of others aside, I will (further) express my own opinion.This book, is perfect in every way. From the realistic characters, to the painful and almost to realistic lost of Augustus Waters, everything was just perfect. This is not a book where you wish to be apart of the world which, I suppose, is a good thing. Those books are often about wizards and vampires. This book was about life. You don't have to wish to be a part of Hazel's and Augustus's world because they are living life just as we are so we have nothing to wish for (in that case). The only difference between our version of life and theirs, is that they don't actually exist. It only feels like they do.If you haven't read this book I highly recommend that you do. But, then again, who hasn't read this book at this point. But, just in case: This book is exceptional and totally worth the read. I hope you laugh and cry just as much as I did... and will again once I finish it for the third time."
4," Yes, the book was depressing. It's a bittersweet love story like I said. I mean it's glaring obvious even from the summary of the book. Two young teenagers, Augustus aka Gus and Hazel, meet in a support group who hit it off immediately because they both had similar brilliant minds that were lighting speed. But both went through life changing experiences that threatened their lives.Honestly there's no 100% happy scenes in this book. It's always touch and go. That isn't a bad thing. But it's pretty hard to want to keep reading to be honest. But I managed to finish it in few hours like I always read books. I was kind of surprised that I was able to finish it which honestly says a lot about the book.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand death from the survivor's point of view. It's quite enlightening. However, I had a hard time believing that those two kids could use big words and speak like they were geniuses on certain subjects. Even Gus' parents would say at one point regarding Hazel and Gus that we have such strange children. They both had quick minds, sharper tongues and in a language that I would love to speak in real life, but don't. Who does?For me, I won't be reading this book again. Once was good enough. It didn't make a profound impact on me and made me cry like Marley &amp; Me did. But it was enough to make you think about death and how it affects people. People who never touch death or have had any suffering do forget how to be understanding and how to behave around people who do know it intimately.For instance, I loved the way the nurse treated Hazel in the hospital. She would say something like, Now since you have been gone a few days, what did you miss? A superstar took drugs, politicians got into an argument, and it rained.. Now see what you've missed, don't go away again. I can't remember the exact words. But it made me chuckle and if I was her in that bed, I would appreciate that. She was better than the nurses who come in and out worried about only your health, but not your spirit.This book reminds you that no matter what happens in life, appreciate every day and don't forget to say I love you every day to the people you love. My mother always said that it's stupid to live every day like it's your last. She would say that instead, we should Live every day like it's a gift. I think that Hazel and Gus would laugh at that and say, Now that's a great quote. I sure hope so."
5," Seventeen-year-old Hazel Grace Lancaster is dying.  She tells us in the first chapter. “…depression isn’t a side effect of cancer. Depression is a side effect of dying.”  Due to her depression and dying for that matter, her mother and doctor want her to be in a support group. She grudgingly goes, pretends to listen then escapes back home to enjoy the latest addition of her favorite reality show.Ironically, the only friends she really can relate to are those in the dreaded support group. Isaac who has a rare cancer that will leave him blind and his friend Augustus Waters, a newcomer to the group, make her feel as normal as she can while dragging her ever present oxygen tank behind her.Augustus was once a star basketball player until cancer claimed one of his legs. He is a video playing, wise cracking guy. Hazel opens up to him in a way she has not connected with anyone in a long time. She tells him of her favorite book, Imperial Affliction by Peter Van Houten. It haunts her because Van Houten ends the book in the middle of a sentence and Hazel feels she has to know the end before she dies.Van Houten lives in Amsterdam. Gus and Hazel end up connecting with him, but find the source of her obsession may just not be worthy of either of their efforts.The most striking thing about this book is the concern Hazel has for her parents after she is gone. She is afraid they will divorce or maybe even curl up and die themselves because they no longer have anything to focus on after caring for a dying child for the last several years. This was not an egotistical assumption on her part, she is afraid she has robbed them of their lives.Wise beyond her years, Hazel also wishes people will look at her and not see someone with cancer. She just wants to be Hazel Grace. That is so profound for a young adult novel. Hazel is wise beyond her years. Not afraid of dying, she is afraid of what her dying will do to anyone close to her. She feels like a bomb ready to explode so she keeps everyone she can at arm’s length so they won’t be hurt when she dies.I highly recommend this book to young adults and adults. I especially recommend this book to anyone who has or has had a child with a serious illness. Speaking firsthand, it is difficult not to worry, coddle, make exceptions for and obsess about a sick child. Even when they get better, it is hard to see them as well. We need to look beyond the illness and at the person. No special treatment, no worrying about what they eat or don’t eat even though it is hard to treat them like their siblings.Kudos go to John Green for writing a wonderfully emotional book from the viewpoint of a dying teenage girl. If I could give it more than five stars, I absolutely would.  If you have seen the movie, I beg you to read the book. Everyone has heard “the book is better than the movie”. Even though the movie was good (aside from the teens loudly trying to out- sob each other) but so many important plot points were left out,  you need to read this book.Copyright © 2014 Laura Hartman"
4," Anecdote the first: I bought the Kindle version, and I liked it so much, I went out and bought the paperback, which I plan to read soon. (there's just something about having the actual book in your hands.) The cashier at the checkout remarked I didn't have tissues in my cart. If he knew it was a weeper, he either read it, saw the movie, or someone in his household did. Whichever one it was, I was charmed that he was aware of the plot.Anecdote the second: When I was in my early 20s, I had the opportunity to read Love Story. It was probably my sister's book, but I'm an avid reader and was willing to read anything. If I recall correctly, it was a novella, not really very long, and I was able to finish it in a couple of hours, lying on the floor of my parents' living room.What does that have to do with The Fault in Our Stars?Spoiler alert: Major characters die in both books, and as a result, I shed tears.Frankly, I was completely spoiler free. I know, how could this be possible? Well, that's me. (I had no clue about the ending of Sixth Sense either, even though I didn't see it until it actually aired on television months --years?--later.Back to TFiOS. I did know both main characters had cancer, so it made sense that one of them wouldn't survive to the end of the book, but I assumed it would be the obvious one. As the book progressed, I began to get an uneasy feeling, which proved to be true.In spite of the topic, this wasn't a depressing book. The characters were wonderful and not one-sided, even Hazel's mom, who I was unsure about. The letter Augustus wrote to Van Houten was beautiful. (I wish someone would write a letter like that to me.)This is going to be one of those books I'll be reading over in the near future, and whether it's the Kindle version or the paperback... well, it doesn't much matter. I'll just make sure I have a box of tissues handy."
5," John Green it seems is a wildly popular young adult writer also famous for a video blog shared with his brother and the world on you-Tube. The book in question is written from the point of view of a girl dying of cancer who meets a tall handsome young cancer survivor at a support group with whom it is mutual love at first sight. Both are wildly articulate as were Judd Apatow’s characters or Kevin Williamson’s on Dawson’s Creek. Call them old souls or old beyond their years. What sets this book and the movies apart is the fact that the teens in question frankly share the emotions and urges common to people their age. Boys see a pretty girl, their bodies react, and they describe their urges--that does not mean they intend to immediately jump her bones. Is it sinful to think they’d like to? I’m no teenager with raging hormones, in fact the fewer the better for my prostate, but the book is well-written and edited, and eminently readable.Interesting that the producers found a young pair who epitomized the characters described in the book who additionally shared what is called chemistry and the movie version is topping the charts over the usual crop of action-adventure summer blockbusters--eat your heart out Tom Cruise. What sets both book and movie apart from the usual disease of the week flick is the fact that it’s about living not dying. Not every young male would feel secure enough in his masculinity to allow a girl drive his car when he takes her home because his prosthetic leg makes his driving erratic. It will be interesting to see if this made it to the movie. Given that I began writing this on Father’s Day I would also give a plug to the parents who raised these two.Cancer victims aren’t given a choice in the matter of hanging tough. It’s either succumb to negativity and expire quickly or fight. It isn’t as if one can get conscientious objector status or be a coward and desert the fight. The title comes from a Shakespearean Sonnet. A lot of the philosophy comes from a fictitious book from a nonexistent authour. Will the trip to Holland make the movie? Since this is a young adult novel we are spared detailed descriptions of the pair’s love-making. What we can’t be spared is the inevitable ending. All people die, young people with cancer die young."
5," This book has been sitting in my Kindle for quite awhile, but I hadn't chosen to read it because I knew it dealt with a teenage cancer patient.  I repeatedly chose other books as my next read because I wasn't wanting to get into a 'heavy' story.  I finally picked it as my next read because I am one who always reads the book before seeing the movie and the movie released recently.I was captivated and moved by this book like no other I've read in a long while.  It was engaging, irreverent, witty, hopeful and tragic.  It was even 'laugh through your tears,' funny and sad at once.  I felt like I was experiencing the story unfolding in 3D as I read.  The writing was amazing and carried me along on a quick pace to keep up with the witty repartee between Hazel Grace and Augustus.  I was surprised by developments in the plot and enjoyed going along for the ride.  (The major plot twist was .... well, MAJOR, and I'm not going to discuss it and spoil your experience of the story.)Hazel Grace may be only 16 years old (or 33 half years), but she is wise beyond her youth having had to face life and death with terminal cancer.  Like Hazel Grace, Augustus too is wise beyond his youth.  They have a perspective on life, death and the universe that only can develop through their journeys through diagnosis, treatment, and always facing their mortality.  They are also refreshingly light and young in their pursuit of normalcy.  I must include here a comment about their friend Isaac who having lost his sight brings out some of the best and humorous 'adjusting to the new normal' teenage scenarios.  I don't think the story would have worked without Isaac as the quirky but loyal best friend.The love story that blossoms from the friendship of Hazel Grace and Augustus - note that I choose to use the names they use for one another - is tender, deep, sweet, and real.  It lifted my heart that in the world of 'Cancervania' their love thrived.  And when it comes right down to the nitty gritty, isn't that what matters - to love and be loved.Yes, this book is about a 16 year old girl with terminal cancer, and yes my eyes are swollen today from the heart wrenching grief and beauty of the story.  And, YES, I recommend reading this amazing book as soon as you can.  This book is one that will move you in unexpected ways and take up residence in your heart ."
4," After being engrossed byJohn Green's Paper Towns a few years ago, I'd had this book on my list for quite some time. I must admit that the primary stimulus to finally getting to it is the release of the movie by the same name, because I like to read the book before seeing the movie whenever I can.This is the story of a sixteen-year-old girl who has been living with, and overcoming, cancer during her too young life, and what sets this apart from other adolescent literature is the authenticity of her narrative voice. Actually, that's not totally true, because authentic narrative voice is one of the many defining characteristics of young adult literature. So perhaps the narrator's voice is whats set it apart from so many cancer books. Hers is not a story written upon reflection as an adult; instead, hers is a story written up reflection as she is living her sixteen-year-old life.As such, she brings other characteristics of effective adolescent literature: the kids are more prominent than the adults, the issues/topics (e.g., insecurity, love, frustration, disappointment, tension) are universal to all adolescents. And John Green does a magnificent job of portraying all of these things through the narrative voice of his female protagonist.The kids who are important elements in each other's lives meet in a support group...not for drug addicts or alcoholics, but for kids dealing with life threatening illnesses! Imagine yourself as a high school sophomore sitting in a circle with people you don't know very well and sharing something as personal as your life-threatening illness. Wow! Within that sacred circle, all manner of experiences are shared at varioius points throughout the story, each one more significant (on multiple levels) than those that preceded it.In addition, Green creates an intellectual climate that allows the major characters to exchange theories of life (and death) that seem unusual for young people, but really shouldn't. Green carefully provides them with a platform for sharing their ideas that encourages even the more relunctant to participate (when ready) and creates opportunities to express their opinions openly and honestly. It is within this setting that Green reminds the reader that young people are capable of more profound thinking and reasoning than most of us realize.The romantic aspect of the story is stimulated by a book the narrator shares with her closest friend and which causes both of them to wonder: Why did it end in the middle of a sentence? (Talk about your open ending!) Their curiosity leads them to find out more about the author and tracking him down in Holland to receive the answer to their question in person. (Willing suspension of disbelief plays a role in every good story, and in this case, it seems too true to their characters to challenge belief...really!)And there are elements that connect up to provide a clear sense of purpose and meaning throughout. Those connections never hint at being coincidences; instead, they are natural extensions of the relationships within the story.The Fault in Our Stars is much more than a cancer story. It is a story of persistence, determination, faith, and friendship that reminds the readers how infinitely important these elements are in our lives, whether face with a life-threatening disease or not.I look forward to seeing the movie soon!"
5," See full review @ The Indigo Quill . blogspot . comI have been waiting for MONTHS for this movie to come out so I could finally review it! I can honestly say that it was worth the wait, because I believe the movie shaped a little more of my view on the book, but we'll get to that.Many who have read The Fault in Our Stars are probably thinking, How can you give the book only THREE stars? Did we read the same book?? It was AMAZING gfghkjhhkhklll. Well, yes. Yes we did. I had heard so much hype for this book and even Amazon was suggesting it to me every time I logged on. I had an Amazon GC, so I decided to take the plunge and purchase this book.First let me say that I did like this book a lot. There was this looming foreboding throughout the entire book that made you want to keep reading, even though you knew the ending was probably going to be depressing. It reminded me a lot of My Sister's Keeper with a touch of A Walk to Remember. And although this was a story about cancer which is generally a very courageous topic to write on, I felt like there were strong points and very weak points:Strong Points:-The overall theme of the book is a topic that hits a lot of people in the gut. Cancer sucks. And I think there were many ways that John Green portrayed the thought processes and reactions that teenagers may experience. I'm not saying they were spot-on, but we have Hazel, who has a more cynical POV, and then Augustus, whose glass is half full.-John Green made the effort to add unique elements to the story, such as Augustus' 'metaphor' or the whole concept of An Imperial Affliction. They were interesting and fresh and are a lot of what made the story.-At surface, the characters are unique. It's comforting to imagine that a kid with cancer is easily positive and wants to make the best of everything, but Hazel was more of a realist. She gave us a glimpse into the reality of a life with cancer when you are meant to be at the very beginning of your journey.-If you're looking for a tragic teen romance, then you'll love this book.-There were several poetic elements and quote-worthy lines interposed into the dialogue.Weak Points:-Not many teenagers talk like that. Some do, but not many have such a wide vocabulary and can spout off soliloquies of several stanzas at a time. It just isn't realistic.-The characters were very static. I didn't feel like there was much depth to the characters or the story, and I felt like we could've been taken so many more places than we were.-There was extreme overuse of or whatever. Especially in the beginning of the book, it felt like it ended almost every single sentence to the point of exhaustion.-I was totally expecting the book to end similar to An Imperial Affliction, and was almost disappointed when it didn't.The movie I give 5 stars."
5," “Pain demands to be felt.”Hazel Grace Lancaster, a terminal cancer patient (“thyroid originally but  with an impressive and long-settled satellite colony in (her) lungs”),  who uses an oxygen tank wherever she goes,  thinks the only think someone should expect of life is dying. But, after a twist ,named Augustus Walters, whose leg was claimed by a bone tumor , appears on her boring routine , her life with take an unpredictable turn.  Hazel (she is the narrator of the story) and Augustus meet at a cancer support group. Thou  they are “very different and disagreed about a lot of things,” they always find a way to make their relationship interesting.John Green create such well crafted characters, and an amazing, never boring plot, it’s inevitable not to love this book.Loved how Gus (Augustus) loves Hazel even thou he know it’s gong to hurt him sooner or later.“Hazel Grace…it would be a privilege to have my heart broken by you.”But not only Gus is suffering (but may not show it) with Hazel’s condition, her parents have to deal with the idea that their only daughter is going to died sooner than they thought. It broke my heart how Hazel’s mom thought she “won’t be a mom any more,” after Hazel dies, which is inevitable. Hazel is “the alpha and omega of (their) suffering.”The Fault in Our Stars is the best  love story written , yet. Romeo and Juliet. Who?John Green made us fall in love with his characters and the story itself.“It’s easy enough to win over people you meet. But getting strangers to love you…now that’s the trick.”And in the process (of falling in love with the characters) “we (the readers) were all wounded in (their) battle.” A courageous battle.Like Hazel says, “the world is not a wish-granting factory.” but (in my opinion) for Gus and her, it made an exception to give their love a “a little infinity.”“Some infinities are bigger than other infinities.”Their love was a piece of “forever within the numbered days.” They enjoyed their time together “on a roller coaster that only goes up.’Thou the book deals with cancer (tragic and sad), it mixes humor without being cruel.“He’s not that smart,” I said to Julie.“She’s right. It’s just the most really good-looking people are stupid, so I exceed expectations.”“Right, it’s primarily his hotness,” I said.“It can be sort of blinding,” he said.“It actually did blind our friend Isaac,” I said.“Terrible tragedy, that. But can I help my own deadly beauty?”“You cannot.”“It is my burden, this beautiful face.”“Not to mention your body.”“seriously, don’t even get me started on my hot bod. You don’t want to see me naked, Dave. Seeing me naked actually took Hazel Grace’s breath away,” he said, nodding toward the oxygen tank.This book teach us “the most important lesson of all: No matter how hard you kick, no matter how high you get, you can’t go all the way around.”I’m thankful for the “little infinity” Green gave me with this lovely story. Still, “my thoughts (about this  book) are stars I can’t fathom into constellations.”Loved this heart-growing book. My heart feels like it’s full and in any minute is going to explode like a grenade. Or it could be all the crying I went through will reading it and after finishing it. 5 (okay maybe 6 or more) Stars"
5,"t is really hard to compartmentalize all that is The Fault in Our Stars, with its sophisticated writing, witty dialogue, deep themes, heart-felt love story, and the amazing characters; I fell in love with it.  I was really hoping that John Green and his novel was not just another over-hyped book, and I am happy to say that it was not.  It is extremely worth all of the hype surrounding it and then some.  I think that this book will soon become a classic and has the power to change reader’s lives.  Yes, this book is that amazing.  This book brought forth feelings from me that I have never felt reading a book before and it is now categorized as one of my favorite books.The writing in this book is superb.  With its witty and sarcastic humor, I found myself regularly laughing.  I feel that the writing in this book is advanced for a Young Adult book, not in the way that a teenager is unable to read it, just in the fact that it is incredibly smart and full of deep themes.  I felt like, although the love story was great, that the other messages in this book were very important.  I loved that this book explored the fear of being forgotten after death and urged the importance of living life to its fullest because no one knows when it will be their time to die.  I feel like this book is very relatable to everyone, even individuals who have never been affected by cancer, because it discusses fears that every human has.  I also liked the statement that “pain needs to be felt” because everyone must go through some sort of pain in their lifespan, whether it is a loss of a loved one to a bad break-up, it’s something that we can all relate to.I absolutely loved all the characters and relationships that were in this book.  I liked the relationship between Hazel and her parents.  As a parent, I can’t imagine what it is like to know for a fact that your child will die.  I liked that it explored Hazel being afraid that she will ruin her parent’s lives if she dies and her mother struggling with being protective over her child, but still letting her live her life.  I also loved the friendship between Isaac and Augustus, as well as the relationship between Augustus and Hazel.  I really enjoyed that Augustus taught Hazel how to live life.  Pre-Gus, Hazel just seemed to sit at home and watch ANTM with her parents, not wanting to create relationships with people who might be affected by her death, but Augustus taught Hazel to live life and embrace love.Overall, I would recommend this book to everyone: young or old, female or male, romance reader or not…this book was amazing.  Although this book is sad, I also felt like it provided hope and understanding.  I will defiantly be picking this book up again…and again…and again."
2," when I say that this book confuses me, I don't mean that I am unable to understand it, because I do. the reason it confuses me is all the different points of views on cancer that there are in this book. who knows if this is just because I set my expectations to high or I really am just not as emotional as most people but, the heart wrenching scenes that everyone talks about in this book really didn't seem that heart wrenching. even simple changes could have made thier love seem stronger. one thing I can tell about John Green is that personally he has had some experience with cancer, it might've been a friend, a family member or even him. He talks about the obvious medical and physical issues of cancer but not really the emotional issues or at least not as much as I thought he would. from personal experience usually someone who is suffering from cancers last month's are the worst and Gus is no exception. there's the constant vomiting, the hallucinations, and the struggle even to do the little things in life that we take for granted. most likely my opinion is a lot different from others, but the decline in those last month's of a person life when dealing with cancer, is more of a routine than a struggle. at least up until the last couple of weeks. I remember ever day that I would come home from school I'd put down my back pack walk into our living room where my dad basically did everything in and tell him about my day. He would just sit there looking at me with those tired eyes. sometimes he'd say a word or two in return but usually his meals were the only things that would come out of his mouth. deep down inside I knew that the father I loved and admired wasn't really there anymore. people ask me why when my dad is brought up I don't cry or get very emotional and it's because I've already cried all the tears I possibly can in those last few months, knowing it would be his last. I shouldn't criticize this book to harshly but in my opinion I think this book would be better suited for someone without much or any cancer experience but I do think it is a very good read for someone who hasn't because other than the things I mentioned this book really isn't to far off from the reality of it all."
5," So, always looking for a good deal, and not knowing anything about the author John Green or the movie now released in the states (I've been living overseas for the past few years, work about 80 hours a week, and sadly don't find much time for fiction), I bought the audio book version of the Fault in Our Stars two weeks ago mostly because it was the deal of the week. It was on sale and I wanted something to listen to during our drive while we were on vacation. I was interested in the seemingly complex, yet fundamental, philosophical and religious nature of the questions it posed and I figured I could con my spouse into listening to it under the guise that it was a love story (which it is). As an aside, my spouse doesn't typically like to read sad books or watch sad movies. Although she does love the Twilight series. (Wait. I'm sorry. That is a very different kind of sad. Seriously. I tried reading the book; couldn't get past the first few pages.) If I may generalize her point of view: there is enough suffering in the world, we should want to escape it, not experience it, in our entertainment. (She may have a valid point.)Either way, when I read the description of the book and then saw that it was categorized as Kids and Young Adults, I was confused. It didn't sound like a typical kids book, not unless it was the kind of book you were assigned to read and begrudgingly write a paper for in high school English class. After listening to the book. I was even more confused. How is it that a novel about existentialism in which young, dying teenagers, confronting the meaning of life, simply categorized as Kids and Young Adults, Romance because the protagonist is a young adult in a romantic relationship? That was a side-story as far as I read the book.What is Kids and Young Adult fiction anyway? That seems like a very strange category. Is there an Adult Fiction category? (Not that kind of adult fiction!). (Let me check the all-knowing internet... Apparently there is. And that doesn't make any sense either.) We apparently have an unrequited need, not shared by the things (and life) we must categorize, to have others categorize and interpret meaning for us (and then to do so, oh so poorly!). Must we always require someone else to provide meaning for us? Can't we find our own answers? Maybe the people who categorized the book should read the book.Finding purpose in life, experiencing love, suffering loss, etc., are not issues we solve at 17 and move on from at 18. (Maybe they are. Am I emotionally stunted?) If anything, my life experiences have taught me that I know less about these things now than I was sure I knew at 17. This book would have resonated with me as a 17-year-old, ska-punk band, cross-country runner and resonates with me now as 32 year-old, father-of-three, professional military officer. (Apparently I, like so many millions of others, thanks to Facebook and other various and sundry social media (?) outlets, define myself, and consequently the meaning of my life, in terms of an endless series of likes, dislikes, activities, emoticons, and #'s. Hooray! I am a composite of my interests and nothing more! The whole certainly is less than the sum of the parts.)I feel like Hazel's father when he proclaims something along the lines of how he thought being an adult meant having all the answers, but upon reaching adulthood finds that he does not and is still searching for answers.Who thought young adult fiction could make this adult think so much... Perhaps the only people who have moved past adolescence are the book categorize-rs. I thank my lucky stars for them. They are the best Father's Day Present ever!"
3,"n the Fault in Our Stars by John Green we meet a pair of cancer survivors, Hazel Grace Lancaster and Augustus Waters.  They meet at a cancer survivors’ support group for teens.  They fall in love.I read a lot of Young Adult fiction.  I realize it’s not written for my age group, but I find some of it very well-written and enjoyable.  Why did I read this book? I read it because everyone has been talking about it non-stop, it’s very popular, and it’s now a major movie.  I knew going into this novel that someone was going to die.  Most of the reviews I read were by people saying how sad it was and how much they cried at the end. I normally shy away from those types of stories, but I kept hearing how great this book is and decided to give it a try.Did I enjoy it?  Yes and no.  Probably more no than yes.  Did I cry when I read it?  No, not at all.  I had read a number of reviews and plot summaries beforehand as I tried to decide whether or not I wanted to read it so I knew going into it who was going to die.  I spent most of the book waiting for it to happen.  I had guessed at how it was going to happen, but I was incorrect in my guess.Why didn’t I love this book?  I didn’t like that the author never actually describes his characters’ physical appearances.  Hazel had a round face (from steroids) and green eyes.  That’s all I remember him saying about how she looked.  I had a hard time picturing her, and when I see the actress who portrays her in the movie, she doesn’t look 16 to me (she’s not in real life – she’s older).  Augustus is described as lanky, and I think he had blue eyes.  Again, I had trouble seeing this boy in my mind’s eye as I read, and that kind-of spoiled it for me.  I like to “see” the characters as I read.I didn’t like the way the author has the characters speak. I get that Hazel is supposed to be really smart, and she attends college classes at age 16, but some of the words she used were ridiculous.  I graduated college with a 4.0 (I’m not stupid), and I had to look up some of the words he had her using.  No one talks like that.I didn’t like the fact that her mother who was very protective and a very involved caregiver allowed a sick 16-year old and a 17-year old to wander around by themselves in a strange foreign city.  They go to Amsterdam to track down the author of Hazel’s favorite book.  Mom goes one way and allows the kids to go do their own thing.  I found that very improbable.  I know it was supposed to be romantic, and parts of it were, but then again the characters behave as if they are in their mid-20’s and not teenagers.I didn’t like the fact that the miracle drug that Hazel takes isn’t real. I read the author’s notes at the end of the book where he admits that he made it up.  I felt deceived when I read that.  As you read the book, you start to hope that such a medicine might be possible and could extend cancer patients lives by a few months or years.  When I read his notes, I was disappointed.I also didn’t care for the whole VanHouten part of the story.  Hazel is obsessed with this book she has read about a cancer patient.  The book she read never really ends and just stops mid-sentence.  She doesn’t know if the main character in the book was supposed to have died, and she wants to know the end of the story.  She wants to find the author. I thought this part of the plot went on too long.  At the funeral when VanHouten just comes up and climbs into her parents’ car, I actually rolled my eyes.  Her parents had never met this guy.  Her Dad would have tossed this drunken guy out of his car.  What the heck?  There were times in the story where Hazel and Augustus were far more mature and wiser than the parents were.  That was just silly to me.Would I recommend this book?  Yes, I do think it’s worth reading.  Would I read it again?  No.  Will I go see the movie?  No.  [Note: I downloaded this book back in January, and it took me until June to read it.]"
5," This book has been on my list for some time, even before the movie came out.  It had an interesting premise, and the number of 5-star reviews was astounding.  But unfortunately for me, the book did not live up to the hype.On the pro side, the author accurately portrays the realities of cancer, dealing with cancer in children, and the unbelievable weight this disease puts on those who have it, and their families.  I especially enjoyed how the author made a point to compare the realities against the tripe that you see in movies that want to sensationalize the disease and manipulate your emotions.There was also some great dialogue, and the banter between the two leads was refreshing and fun to read, if a tad unrealistic at times.But, I was not gripped by the story.  I didn't think it was deep, nor did it keep me glue to the pages to the end.  It was interesting enough to finish, but not a page-turner, as they say.  To be fair, the beginning of the book pulled me in.  But it didn't have the staying power that would compel me to give a 4- or 5-star review.  Like I said in my review title (and I know I am in the minority here), I thought it was good, but not great.Secondly, I am bothered by this silly notion that so seems to preoccupy so many authors and screenwriters - true romance needs to be validated by sex.  In the book, the two teens have their very first kiss (a great scene, I thought), then run straight back to the hotel and have sex, where the boy loses his virginity.  C'mon, do we have to always employ this trope? If you want to be different, have some guts and write a story where the teenagers *don't* have sex.  Crazy, I know.  Especially 20 minutes after their first kiss.  Good grief.It is an easy read, and I can see why so many people like it.  But, it only garners three stars from me."
3," Hazel Grace Lancaster is 16 years old with thyroid cancer that settled in her lungs…”leaving her lungs that suck at being lungs.”  She goes to a Support Group once a week to make her parents happy.  Her parents just want her to be a normal teenager and make new friends.  The Support Group includes young adults that are no older than 18 years old.  In Support Group Hazel meets Augustus Waters.Hazel, Augustus and Isaac are all good friends.  They are just teens trying to live a normal life all with some form of cancer.  You will laugh with them and also cry with them.Hazel and Augustus talk about Hazel’s favorite book, “An Imperial Affliction” by the fictional Peter Van Houten.  The book tells the story of a girl with cancer and ends suddenly when the girl dies, and both Hazel and Augustus long to learn what would happen next.  Hazel still has questions on what happens after the end of the novel.  Both Hazel and Augustus write to Peter Van Houten and they are invited to Amsterdam.  As they are falling in love,  Hazel gets the ok from her doctors and is allowed to travel to Amsterdam to meet Peter Van Houten along with her mother and Augustus.I can honestly say we have never read a book like this before.  This book is romantic,  heart warming,  hilarious, funny,  and utterly sad.  This book is well written and the first book we have read by John Green.  We loved every part of this book.The Fault In Our Stars is a romantic love story that we could not put down.  In the support group their motto is, “Living our best life today” and Hazel, Augustus and Isaac are all trying to be normal teenagers living with cancer.  You will need tissues reading this book…  We certainly did.  Okay…Okay…."
3," wanted to read this because of how Hazel and Augustus speak to each other in the movie trailer. It sounded so...familiar...and I wanted it to be in a book instead of a movie, because movies are shorter and can't live on in my imagination the way books can and do. And I wanted to know that John Green, the author of the novel, created Hazel and Augustus sounding like that, because that meant that's who they really were/are. And that did/do sound just like that in the book, better, even, which means he really knew them and loved them, and it wasn't just that another writer or three came along and punched up all the dialogue to make the movie more marketable, more commercial, more Something than it actually was. And the movie doesn't come out for a few more days, and I'm not sure if I'll even see it now, because even though Gus and Hazel will always *look* like the actors playing them--to me, at least--the bits from the trailer have been augmented with and magnified by the lovely prose of the book in ways the film can't possibly ever live up to.But those aren't the cliches I was afraid of falling into. What I'm afraid I don't know how to articulate well are the feelings I'm left with after finishing it, about how my life and my love for others and theirs for me is such a privilege, even if it's often ephemeral, fleeting. Like Isaac, I want True Love to be permanent, and maybe it's not realistic to expect that from anyone else, I feel impelled to be a source of Permanent Love in the world around me. I don't know if I can actually do or be such a thing, given how easily I take offense, how pointedly I respond to the faintest perceived slight.But a man can dream, can't he? And so I shall. And maybe one day before I too pass into the oblivion that Augustus feared, I'll find that, while I haven't reached the lofty heights I aspired to, I will be able to look down at my present self from a somewhat elevated place and know that my efforts weren't in vain, because I will know that I Loved as deeply and as completely as I was capable of. And that will be enough."
5," When a novel already has 17k reviews, another is a mere drop in the bucket, nothing to really make a mark, or an influence.I find I'm a bit like Hazel in regards to mine, in the fact that I don't wish to make a mark.A friend of mine was so kind to gift this book to me, in my desperation to read it before I see the movie (a minor quirk of mine - I can't see a movie based on a book without reading it first).I read this novel in 4 and a half hours, with breaks to tear apart my quarreling children. Luckily (for me) they were asleep for the last 50% or so of the book.Keep your s*** together, I whispered to my lungs - Loc 1369John Green's take on cancer, the entire outlook of a young woman who knows that she will die (though not when, or how much time she has) really drew me in. He completely steals the reader's pity or even sympathy; instead, you accept it as unchangeable truth, and keep trucking along in reading. It was refreshing, to not have the super sad from the beginning, which, in this style of story, could be taken.The weird thing about houses is that they almost always look like nothing is happening inside of them, even though they contain most our lives. Loc 1471The depth of thinking, especially in characters so young, forces this novel from a YA genre and into one that is fit for all ages. As a young-ish mother, I related to Hazel as well as her and Gus' mothers. I understood the hovering, the wanting to protect my children, while understanding the will to live your life as you can. I fell in love with Gus alongside the heroine, dreaded every page turn for medical updates, and was outraged with Van Houten and his attitude.I guess, in simple terms, the only thing I can say is that I loved the book. My thoughts are stars I can't fathom into constellations.  Loc 3206"
5," The Fault in Our Stars by John Green is narrated by Hazel, a sixteen year old with stage four thyroid cancer that she says has, “an impressing and long-settles satellite colony” in her lungs. Thanks to a drug treatment she calls “the Miracle” Hazel’s cancer has been kept from spreading further. After going to a support group with many other cancer survivors, she comes across Augustus who has been cancer free for years, but started coming to support his friend. When both of them meet it was love at first sight, because neither could take their eyes off of each other. They both go on a crazy journey with ups and drastic downs, but both fight through and try to make the best of the unknown rime that they have together. Things come to a stop when Hazel ends up on the hospital because her lungs need draining (a side effect of the miracle drug). Life is short, and Hazel doesn’t want to spend it all at home when she has so many opportunities waiting for her out there, like going to Amsterdam to meet her favorite author. But if she goes, can she keep Augustus from loving her? And can she keep from loving him back? I don’t think I have ever read a book as quickly as I did this one. This book was a page turner, I wanted to know more and more until I realized I finished all of it. I believe that the reason this book is so special, is because it really isn’t a regular love story. This story is more realistic than anything I’ve ever read. Life doesn’t always have happy endings, but it sure does have many exciting moment in between; and I feel that more people should realize that. After reading, I had a whole different mindset of life in general. I realized that the little things in life shouldn’t be taken for granted, because we never know what could happen tomorrow. Yes, I did find many of the metaphors and quotes included in the book were cheesy and pretentious, but in the need the overall moral was what mattered most to me. I really enjoyed reading this book and feel as if more people should buy and read it as well. Despite its very minor flaws, The Fault in Our Stars is ultimately a tale of star-crossed lovers, and although it followed a path of similar cancer books, the ending takes a unpredictable turn which I did not expect. In the end I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a good laugh, or even a good cry every once in a while."
5," Wow- what can I say about this book that has not already been said? The writing was great; it is honest and real. The story itself was funny, lovely, and emotional. The characters are amazing- I loved how these teens did not let their disease define them. These characters suffered through a variety of emotions, they talked openly, they LIVED their life despite any limitations.The writer makes an observation how society often views and treats the terminally ill as another entity. I realize that this observation is pretty true - Regretfully I also realize that I have had this mindset myself at one time or another and I think it stems from our own personal awkwardness, anxiety, and fear about a circumstance we all don't fully understand. An important thing for people to remember is by doing this, we are not contributing to any type of quality of life for others. I'm so glad I read this book and I'm glad it is so popular so others also are reminded that we are all people and all of our struggles are different. Any of us could die tomorrow whether it is of disease or an accident. Everyday is a gift, make the most of it!!!!!My favorite quote:“There are infinite numbers between 0 and 1. There's .1 and .12 and .112 and an infinite collection of others. Of course, there is a bigger infinite set of numbers between 0 and 2, or between 0 and a million. Some infinities are bigger than other infinities. A writer we used to like taught us that. There are days, many of them, when I resent the size of my unbounded set. I want more numbers than I'm likely to get, and God, I want more numbers for Augustus Waters than he got. But, Gus, my love, I cannot tell you how thankful I am for our little infinity. I wouldn't trade it for the world. You gave me a forever within the numbered days, and I'm grateful.”"
5," *Audio book review.I promised myself that I would find time and a way to read this book BEFORE the movie released. I did this because I watched Divergent and DIDN'T read the book first and I still hate myself for that. I knew that this type of book just wasn't my first choice to actually read so I went ahead and got the Audio Book. My logic was: If I can't stand to READ it, I can stand to LISTEN to it C;I loved Hazel's voice, not the woman who was reading, but how the character thought and considered her actions. She sounded more like an adult (especially with the big words she threw around so effortlessly), then the 16 year old the author made her out to be.Gus was Gus. He was kind, sweet, thoughtful, and wanted to give Hazel the best of her days. Though, since Karma is a bitch, it was actually the opposite that happened. I can't really go into much because it's such a big spoiler.Hazel and Gus's love was so pure and sweet. Your heart broke, from the beginning for them, because you knew they had a shorter infinitely, then the rest of us. If you consider it, the relationship was hopeless from the beginning. I'm tearing up while writing this, but, MY GOD, this touched my heart...I HATED that ending. I believe that EVERY character I read about has to have an end. Be it dead, with a family, or just plain suffering in a hospital bed for eternity. I will never get an end for Hazel and (if you read the book) you'll know how ironic it is because it's the same dream that Gus tried to fulfill for Hazel.Final Conclusion: You start out the story thinking it'll go one way, but you get the rug pulled out from under you by the last third of the novel and boy, was I breathless when that happened.Audio Book Review:I loved the woman's voice for this (Her name is: Kate Rudd). I found it cute that she actually made an effort to change the severity/tone of her voice for me to actually realize that it's another character talking and not just Hazel day dreaming.Favorite Quotes:No quotes this time! I actually listened to this at night so even if I wanted to burn my retinas and write down the quotes I was just TOO lazy to preform the act C;"
2," read The Fault in Our Stars because my boyfriend's thirteen-year-old cousin loves this book, and I wanted to read it so we could see the movie together upon its release. I'm not going to rehash the plot because other reviewers have already done so. TFIOS was the first book I ever read by John Green. I liked his writing style; I thought it was fluid and easy to follow. I thought many of his descriptions were lovely to read, especially those of Amsterdam. I've read a lot of YA love stories by female writers, so it was refreshing to read a love story written by a guy. I definitely think this is a book that both male and female readers can enjoy.  Even though I really enjoyed the story and was very touched by it, I agree with some reviewers who have said that the main characters and writing can come across as a little pretentious. I don't think it's totally realistic for teenagers (or most people, for that matter) to quote whole passages of poetry and novels to each other in casual conversation, and I don't mean this at all condescendingly.Also, at times, I was a little annoyed by the main character, Hazel Grace. There were times she came across as having a pretty bad attitude and seemed to look down on others, as though they somehow couldn't measure up to her greatness. This, however, is somewhat of a double-edged sword because she IS struggling with something extremely significant, something of which would lower anyone's spirits. My only warning is this: readers looking for an in-depth look at a person's struggles with cancer is not necessarily going to find it here. Even though John Green does go into detail about the issue, the topic of cancer is pretty minimal compared to other things that occur in the story -- and he has admitted himself that he altered a few realities of cancer to do what he wanted with the story. My suggestion, as always, is to try the book out yourself and to go into it with an open mind. Happy reading!"
4," bought this book on a whim. I knew it was vastly popular so I was curious and wanted to see what all the hype was about.  I didn't even bother with the sample, just went for it.I should say I've never read a John Green novel, I knew nothing about him or his previous works, and I had no idea about this book minus the fact that it dealt with two teenagers who meet at a cancer support group and I figured it could go so many ways.After this I will be checking out all of his other works!  First, I had NO idea(again, completely clueless here) that John Green hails from Indianapolis, nor did I know the book took place in Indianapolis, but the small little bits of Indiana mixed into the novel made me love it even more as I too am a fellow Hoosier.I absolutely INHALED this book. It was a very quick read and I managed to read it in pretty much one sitting because I couldn't put it down.  First off, I adored John Green's writing style, it was witty and complex intermixed with just that right amount of humor to make it impossible to put down.This book, however, just took my breath away.  It was so nuanced and detailed. It had depth and humor at just the right moments, and it broke my heart.  At times I wasn't sure if it was an accurate portrayal of how teenagers interact, but then I reminded myself that Hazel Grace and Augustus weren't your average teenagers.  But to be honest, even if it wasn't 100% accurate, I didn't care.  I loved it anyway.  I fell in love with both Augustus and Hazel, but secondly I adored Hazel's parents.  I loved her sweet, caring father, and her always championing mother.This is one of those books I'm so glad I just took a chance on and it's one that I'm still thinking about days later(I finished the book in the wee hours on Saturday).  I think it is one I foresee myself reading again because I want to get swept up in the characters again.I can't wait to read more of John Green's books!"
4," The Fault in Our Stars Review (Spoiler alert) After finishing The Fault in Our Stars I was completely overwhelmed with emotion, this book was utterly amazing and I felt the need for some sort of review to acknowledge this piece of work. Now I haven’t written many reviews, so bare with me. I started reading this book on a plane ride and from the first paragraph I was so entranced with the humor and stunning sort of sarcastic writing, that had me nailed to the page at first glance. What really caught my eye in the beginning was how he introduced the character through a way that made you want to connect and feel what the character was feeling. To begin with, John Green uses lots of symbolism and metaphors, for example: he often refers to the cigarette between Augustus`s lips (20). I think the way Green pulls your attention is through the constant unexpected events, like when at first Hazel feels anger when Augustus is putting a cigarette between his teeth until he explains the metaphor behind it. John Green seems to have all these sayings and quotes that stick with you forever. I mean, are you really ever going to see a cigarette the same way again after reading this book? Of course not! He brings this story to life by these quotes and sayings, by his emotion and constant humor. Another aspect of this book that I noticed was John Greens constant ability to bring about an emotion, a feeling through every word being spoken in your head. I laughed and cried many times during this book. And talk about unexpected events! Who would’ve guessed that Augustus would be the one to pass? I sure didn’t. Another way that Green decides to use symbolism is through his constant reference to An Imperial Affliction. He shows us that just like a book our life can end just like that without any warning that they will never know what happens to Anna and they suppose she died. And life can end just like that, when we are in full swing it can happen, John Green was using this book as a symbol to tell us all of those things. I also feel the author is trying to portray that famous human beings, like the author of An Imperial Affliction, don’t always turn out to be what we think them up to be in our head. The author turned out to be a horrible drunk that was very rude and condescending to Hazel and Augustus, but we do find out that he had a horrible loss of his daughter when she was very young. This all does make a lot of sense to the way he is, but in Hazels mind he was this hero that wrote a piece of work to inspire people and change lives when really he was writing in pain and letting out all of his emotion onto the page, which in turn is very inspiring to us, the reader and Hazel as well as Augustus. Completely surprising us with this change of events and the story behind it all. What I also noticed in the book is that it really does end like An Imperial Affliction, we never really find out what happened to Hazel after Augustus died. We don’t ever hear an epilog or what her life turned out to be. The book just stops. But that is also the beauty of it, we get to have all these emotions built up and thrown at us through 313 pages and it just ends to let our mind wonder and explore our own endings in our head. This I feel is an amazing thing because our imagination can carry us so far. To tell you the truth, like it said in the book, I feel that this book is mine, like it has empowered me to write. It has empowered me to believe in love and believe in hope, to understand also that life can end on a dime. This book has made me want to live my every day to the fullest and love at every chance I get. I empower you to read this book if you would like to laugh and cry and just be completely overwhelmed with emotion until the very last page."
5," Warning: This review may contain spoilersI have been dragging my feet literally when it came to reading this book.  See, I thought this book was going to be too overly sentimental.  Plus, I have never read any book by John Green before.  I also thought this was going to be like A Walk to Remember by Nicholas Sparks.  I was right, in a way.  When I was able to purchase the audiobook (via an Amazon Local Promo) last week, I decided to listen.  Initially, I had thought I would be listening to the book over the course of a week while driving from work but it did not pan out that way.  I was able to finish it in less than 24 hours.The Fault in Our Stars is about two cancer teens.  One with terminal cancer (Hazel) and one in remission (Augustus).  Both of them met at a Cancer support group.  Both of them fell in love.  Naturally, when we are talking about cancer, this story does not end well…for both of them.I cannot stop gushing about this book.  This is just simply a work of absolute brilliance.  John Green really captured the feelings of being a teen and being terminally ill.  Not that I have been terminally ill but in my line of work, I am exposed to these sorts of things – being around the terminally ill, I mean.I love the overall pace and feel of the book.  And for a cancer book, it wasn’t really about cancer.  It was more about the love between two people complicated by cancer.  This is one of the reasons that I love the story.  The voice of the main characters Hazel and Augustus didn’t really sound like normal teenagers.  But then, they weren’t really normal teenagers.  I love their vocabulary.  Granting that not a majority of teens speak like them but I’d like to think that because of their condition, they are more mature than your regular 16 and 17 year old.I love the secondary story about Hazel’s favorite book “An Imperial Affliction” by Peter Van Houten.  I think that including this in the plot really made us see how strong Gus’ feelings towards Hazel is.  When he went out of his way to give up his wish so that they could go to Amsterdam to meet Van Houten.I also love the twists of the story.  I knew someone was going to die.  The question was: who would die first.  Initially, I thought that Hazel would be the one to go but then when Gus said that “he lit up like a Christmas tree” I knew that it wouldn’t be so.  I also loved how the author portrayed a very strong female character in Hazel.  Initially, she didn’t start out that way but as the story progressed you could see that she was.I love the reality that was injected into the story.  The incontinence, the vomit – everything that you see when there is terminal cancer involved.  Including the medical lingo that Green used.  I am used to hearing those terms and I thought those were incorporated to the story really well.  So it did feel very realistic.The story was written really simply.  I love that.  It was straight forward but it told the whole story really well.  Sort of like using a few words to adequately describe something.  Concise.I cried.  I did.  I could not help myself.  This was emotional but not in an overly dramatic sort of way but real.  I really empathized with them, even with Isaac.My favorite quote would be the one when Gus said, “Maybe ok can be our always.”THE AUDIOBOOKThe audiobook is narrated by Kate Rudd and I love her narration.  I love the changes in voices that she used, especially between Hazel and Gus.  When her voice breaks and cracks at the appropriate times is just brilliant!  I actually felt like it was Hazel talking to me.I liked the pacing that she used and I was able to follow the story without any problem at all.  I also think that her narration added to the overall effect of the book.  I liked that she sounded like a teenager trying to be an adult.  Since I listened to this book without pause, I did not get bored or get annoyed by her voice.  Overall, this was one amazing listen.  I would definitely find out more about the books read by Kate Rudd.Originally posted on my blog I Heart Romance"
2," When I first picked up this book I was on a bit of a dry spell with contemporary literature. I had read the beginning pages of Fault before but it never grabbed me immediately. Upon recommendations I decided to give another go at it, and I’m glad I did. The premise of the book is essentially a love story between two teenagers who have cancer. A lot of what the pair say are beyond their years, but I never felt it was impossible for them to speak such. There are many novels that give me a sense the author is pretending to be the characters, but fortunately it did not happen here. I was very clear who Hazel and Augustus are, and I almost felt a kinship with them. Perhaps it is because of that kinship I was also completely heartbroken the entire time reading it. In particular, I spared no tears reading the last part of the book, and the last time the waterworks happened was reading The Kite Runner five years ago.It is true that John Green is incredibly gifted with making sublime sentences that make your mouth water. So often while reading I marveled at his ability to create these vivid scenes in my mind, and I was completely jealous that I was not able to do the same. After I finished I reflected on the message the novel wants to present, and I wasn't sure there is one. This might be the one flaw of the book – the lack of a take away. It appears that this book is just a story, a beautifully made fluff piece, much like many Hollywood films we watch for enjoyment not for thoughtful reexamination of our lives.Despite that, I would still recommend reading this novel, if not for the superior sentences, then for the fact that Green quotes William Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar, T.S. Eliot’s “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,” and William Carlos Williams’ “The Red Wheelbarrow,” all of my favorites. So needless to say it certainly struck a cord with me. If you enjoy a quick read that you can savor, but is not life altering, then this is the book for you."
5," read The Fault in our Stars by John Green today. I often hesitate with ratings and reviews because the judgment of a reader towards a beloved, boring, or satisfying book is so inequitable. How does one compare Atlas Shrugged against Leaves of Grass, or rate The Upanishads using the same classifiers as one does with Gone Girl? How does our own subjectivity play out within a five point system? A book is capable of touching me on many levels. Who am I to say that certain levels are better than others? And yet, as a subjective person, I find some writing more meaningful to me than others. What I can state is whether a book touched me or not. I can assess whether a book surprised me, challenged me, left me with a sense of wonder, lifted me, seduced me, or simply passed time pleasantly. There are also books that cannot move me past the first few pages. How meaningful that should be to anyone else is uncertain. As an avid bibliophile, my proclivities in books somewhat define me. I often hold them close, not even singly, but en total, as a treasure that I would rather not discuss. The gifts within books reveal themselves to me the way a pyramid accumulates width and depth, stone by stone, yet within a larger scheme. Within this larger scheme, I can assert that this book is popular for a reason. In my own mind, that reason is valid. I am a sucker for some of the techniques used in it. On the other hand, I knew the story before finishing the first page. The sign of this book's largess is that the knowledge did not diminish the experience of the book itself for me. I would have preferred one character to have been further redeemed. I would have preferred this or that or the other, but it was not my novel to write. Yet, all novels become ours when we read them. Therefore I can say that John Green's novel was an enhancement. The Fault in our Stars enriched this reader, and I place a high value on being able to make that statement."
4," ‘But it is the nature of stars to cross, and never was Shakespeare more wrong than when he has Cassius note, ‘The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars / But in ourselves.’The contemporary genre in general has never been my go-to type to read. Personally I like to sit down with a book and open up onto another world. Not necessarily fantasy but I’ve never cared to read about real-life problems that humans have to deal with on a day to day basis. Depression, death, heartbreak and everything along those lines that manage to make life so dreadfully difficult. For this reason, I always avoided John Green’s novels and this one in particular because, who wants to read about a girl that’s dying of cancer? Apparently, me. This was my first John Green novel, yet I can safely say this will not be my last. And the one thing everyone wants to know: I didn’t cry. Okay, I didn’t BAWL but it did come pretty close and for me that’s pretty miraculous.‘You realize that trying to keep your distance from me will not lessen my affection for you. All efforts to save me from you will fail.’Hazel Grace Lancaster is a girl who doesn’t expect to live for very long at all. As she puts it so eloquently, “I’m a grenade and at some point I’m going to blow up and I would like to minimize the casualties, okay?” She knows she’s going to die, she knows it’s inevitable that she’s going to cause some pain, but she’s doing the best she possibly can to keep people at a distance so as to not cause any unnecessary pain. Then she meets Augustus Waters. These two meet in a cancer support group and they are two peas in a pod getting along so well so quickly and falling for one another equally as quick. While suffering through the harsh realities of life with cancer, these two add a flair of wit and sarcasm that manages to make the bleakest of subjects surprisingly funny. Regardless of the humor these two imbue into the story, those harsh realities make their expected appearance so as to cause heartbreak and great distress forcing us as the reader back into the tragic reality of the lives they’ve been given.‘You have a choice in this world, I believe, about how to tell sad stories, and we made the funny choice.’Hazel and Augustus are the stars of this show but there are several other noteworthy characters as well. Their friend Isaac recently underwent a surgery which made him blind but prior to that he was dealing with the loss of his long-term girlfriend. So after the surgery, Hazel and Augustus take him over to her house so he can egg her car. At one point, Augustus says, “Hazel Grace! Take a picture of this so Isaac can see it when they invent robot eyes.” I rewound that on my audiobook about three times because it was so ridiculous yet so touching how these three bonded together to be there for one another. It made me laugh, it made me smile and it made me sad because of their unfortunate circumstances.In addition to the strong friendships showcased, there was another surprising addition to this story and that’s a strong parent presence and relationship. It’s often seen in YA fiction the complete lack of parents but not only were Hazel’s parents present, they were a huge and necessary support group for her and it was such a joy to see. It was clear that Hazel’s mother was trying to make her daughter as happy as possible for the short time she had.“HAZEL! IT’S YOUR THIRTY-THIRD HALF BIRTHDAY!”“Ohhhhhh,” I said. My mom was really super into celebration maximization. IT’S ARBOR DAY! LET’S HUG TREES AND EAT CAKE! COLUMBUS BROUGHT SMALLPOX TO THE NATIVES; WE SHALL RECALL THE OCCASION WITH A PICNIC!, etc.”The Fault In Our Stars is a love story but it’s so much more than that. This is a truly heartbreaking and powerful tale. We’re given such a small amount of time to live as it is yet the characters in this story are given even less. Cancer is a thief, a robber, a purloiner of time. Living life to its absolute fullest is the only thing you can do and these characters did just that. I am highly recommending this book even for those of you who were like me and didn’t care to suffer through the heartbreak of watching fictional characters die. Looking past the heartbreak and suffering you’ll see a hopefulness and a zeal for life that is quite contagious. So, give it a shot, okay? Okay."

This show will be spoiler free.The Fault In Our Stars, or TFiOS as it's affectionately known by its loyal fan base, tells the story of Hazel Grace, a teenager with terminal cancer. In the first chapter she meets Augustus, whose own cancer is in remission.Hazel requires constant oxygen because, as she says, Her lungs suck at being lungs, while Augustus lost his leg in his fight to conquer the disease.The two of them immediately feel a magnetic attraction and swiftly fall in love, sharing discussions about life and philosophy, literature, art, and the nature of infinity.In particular they become obsessed with An Imperial Affliction, a novel about a teenage cancer victim by the mysterious Peter Van Houten, who long ago retired to the Netherlands.In an act of supreme cruelty, or brilliance, depending on who you ask, Van Houten didn't really end his novel, interrupting it mid sentence on the last page to indicate that the main character passed away.It's a bold statement about the nature of death and how it isn't all wrapped up in the end, which Hazel and Augustus can sympathize with.While that's very very deep and meaningful and Hazel and Augustus completely understand the message, Hazel has been obsessed with finding out what happened to the other characters after the novel's last page.After some unsatisfying correspondence with Van Houten, they decide to seek him out in the Netherlands to seek their answers.This story carried deeper significance to me than merely two star-crossed lovers brought together by their maladies. My father is a cancer survivor twice, and I lost my mother to breast cancer three years ago. So with that in mind, this book had moments that were difficult to get through.But as someone with personal experience, I can say that the depiction of cancer victims in TFiOS is excellently done. Cancer changes everything about your life except for the fact that, like the rest of us, you still have to live it.It's actually incorrect of us to describe people as cancer victims, because those are two words that do not define them. They are people who have cancer. People comes first.They are just like the rest of us in that they have hopes and dreams and fears and faults, and they just also happen to have this incredibly terrible disease.Like any major life experience, cancer shapes the way that Hazel and Gus see the world, but it doesn't define them as people. They are who they are for the same reasons as the rest of us--the way and place they were raised, the things they've seen and done, and the thoughts they've had about life.This is summed up best by their relationship. Hazel is not in love with Augustus because he, like her, has cancer. She falls in love with him because he is beautiful, inside and out, and their personalities mesh in a way she's never experienced before. His cancer has nothing to do with it, other than the fact that it's something they can both relate to.In the story, their illness does double time as a plot device. For the average American teenager, a spur-of-the-moment romantic trip to the Netherlands simply isn't feasible, but Hazel and Augustus are able to do it because of an organization similar to the Make a Wish foundation.In this way, John Green provided a believable solution to a problem that would otherwise require some sort of eye-rolling deus ex machina moment.I'd like to take a brief moment to discuss the dialogue in the story. In my review of Divergent I complained about how the teenagers would randomly spout philosophy incongruent with their general dialogue.In TFiOS, Hazel and Augustus are veritable philosophical machines, but it works because their disease has turned their attention inward, and they've become analytical about life, death, the universe and everything.A note on writing style: this was my first John Green book, and as I flipped through the editorial reviews in the beginning, there was a comment from E. Lockhart stating, and I quote, John Green is one of the best writers alive. And I was like, Psssh. Yeah. Okay.After reading the book, he might not be wrong.I debated my rating on this book because five stars means I would recommend it to anyone without question, but due to its emotional content I wondered if I would actually do that, considering how many of us have lost people to this disease.But in the end, it was just too good. I give The Fault in Our Stars five stars out of five.No book that I'VE read in the last decade has had this much of an emotional impact on me or done so much to communicate the reality of the terminally ill.The nature of my five-minute book reviews means I can't possibly do it justice within this video, so in summary I can only say that this book is important to all of us, not just those who are suffering from cancer, but those who are suffering from the other great side effect of death: life.Thank you for watching."
4," This book was so unrealistic I kept getting annoyed and couldn't enjoy the story. It a sad theme,we know from the outset someone is going to die from cancer. Hazel has cancer, carries an oxygen tank and needs special apparatus at night to help her breathe. Yet  one moment she is on death's door, the next she is flying off to Europe. She manages to get out of bed in the middle of the night, equipment and all I presume, without her parents noticing and drive to meet Augustus. She's sixteen I think and has been ill for around three years so not sure when or how she managed to learn to drive. Apart from us knowing she has cancer and the equipment she needs, she does not seem to be very inconvenienced by her illness. One of the characters becomes very ill towards the end of the book and that is the only realistic, unpleasant reality of cancer that we glimpse. Augustus is too perfect as a character, good-looking, charming, intelligent ,witty and so mature and.... completely unrealistic. Both Augustus and Hazel have been very ill teenagers and yet they are so mature and accepting of what is to come. Apart from the physical changes, they seem to have suffered none  of the psychological effects that cancer would have, especially on a teenager who would have so many other changes to deal with also. They certainly do not speak like teenagers, they are witty all the time and make comparisons with events from works of literature etc. They are obviously so well read they have a mastering of the English language way beyond most people. Yet Hazel left school at thirteen and as far as we know has only read one book, presumably Augustus missed some of his education also.If the characters has been a bit older I could have accepted them being so mature maybe. I liked the idea of this book but I think the story should have reflected the harsh reality of cancer a bit more (after all it was the main theme) and the emotions that they might have had to deal with. I'm normally quite an emotional person but this book did not move me probably because I didn't feel we were about to lose 'real' people."
5," This is a moving story of a couple of teen age children (a girl and a boy) afflicted with terminal cancer. John Green tells the story through the voice of the girl. It is very matter of fact and does not drip with self pity or sadness. But the narrative is so moving that if these pages do not bring tears to your eyes, your heart will have to be of stone!Death is not only inevitable but possible at any moment in our lives. However, we are evolutionarily trained to compartmentalize this fact and handle life as if we will live  forever. Only when facing a terminal disease and given a short time to live, do people honestly look at the meaning of their lives and contemplate what they would have done differently. Some then try to make the best of their remaining life while others wallow in misery or prayer. The situation becomes even more tragic when children have to go through this. In recent years due to various known and unknown reasons incidence of cancer has increased - even in children. Most of us seldom imagine (or can imagine even if we try) what will be going through their minds as they fight this deadly disease and handle  the pain of the disease as well as its treatment. But very clearly - John Green can.We have heard that sometimes the treatment is worse than the disease. This is especially true for cancer. And further, in many cases, hundreds of thousands of dollars are spent for extending the life of a patient by a few months. But how do we draw the line? These are very tough questions that our society will have to solve. And how do we handle the emotional trauma of the patients and their families, especially in the case of children and their parents?This book will make you ponder these questions, in addition to giving you a beautiful story to read."
2," _The Fault in Our Stars_ is the very best in YA literature where kids are treated like adults by the writer and yet still realistically tethered to doting parents; Children struggling to become their own person and parents who just wanted to enjoy [their child's] show while it was still in town.Here, the children are battling the emperor of all illnesses, the imperial affliction of cancer. So there is gut-wrenching suffering, but, more front and center are Green's well-informed allusions to literature and science and art, all we need to try to answer the eternal existential questions of what it means to be alive. There is no simple cliche lengthy battle with cancer, but instead a lengthy battle with human consciousness, the realization of the the universe's need to make and unmake all that is possible. Life for both 15 year old Hazel Grace and 17 year old Augustus Waters is termed a side effect of dying. Because their bodies have betrayed them, their brains are the focus, thus understandably, they are both bitter and cynical and angry at what fate has dealt them. But, what drives them and their story is a deeply intellectual compulsion to feel everything, answer the demand of the universe to be observed. The suffering is cut by brilliantly self-referential gallows humor, full of heart and youth and curiosity and longing for understanding and to be understood.It's a great love story and there's a mission, purposefully off to a rapid start because there's no time to spare in either of their lives, culminating in an at once disappointing but still utterly glorious magical time among elm seeds falling like snow.There is beautiful language throughout.Hazel remarking on Gus's selflessness: I liked the way his story ended with someone else.Speaking of the non-space but very real space they occupied when they were on the phone with each other, Hazel observes, I could hear his crooked smile.Friendships in illness: 'Hmm,' she said. 'Hmm,' I said.Gus's stubborn forthrightness: 'I'm in love with you, and I'm not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things.'And the refrain that'll stay with an observant reader a long time: It seemed like forever ago, like we'd had this brief but still infinite forever. Some infinities are bigger than other infinities.As for critique, I couldn't help noticing how very alike Hazel and Gus were, like two sides of the same coin, really male and female versions of the same character. I loved them both, but still wish there'd been some characteristics that made them unique. All the mentions of breathing hardware did tend to get repetitive and, though I felt the sorrow in what was happening, I kept wanting to feel more. No doubt, the emotions resonated, but could have resonated even more. (perhaps if the characters had been built with a smidge more layering) Nonetheless, I'll remember these kids and I'll remember this book."
5," This story made me cry, no doubt.But, besides the usual scarring that comes from the death of such a beloved character as Augustus, I was illuminated. The thoughts that cross my mind are no longer unimportant. I question anything and everything, and my way of thinking has been irrevocably affected by both Hazel Grace and Gus. I can only fathom a guess as to what it felt to loose the only person who meant the world to you, and I think the most stressing part of the whole situation was not being able to live a longer life with that person. Yet, this is what made their relationship so beautiful and perfect; that even though they knew that death would one day befall upon them, they lived their lives with no regrets. I wish I was like Gus, with the same sense of humor that, as quoted, didn't offend anyone. I wish I had his will and determination to put other's happiness before his own, even till his Final Days. The strength he had to keep living on that sloping roller coaster was admirable, even without a limb. Hazel is more relatable in the fact that she is a teenage girl, and that I want her philosophical ways of thinking about life like a slap in the face.What I would give for a sequel, or a second book about living and loving with cancer. I would continue to cry my eyes out and accept that life is indeed one big roller coaster. I thank John Green for this glorious book, and I cant wait to read the rest of his collection and purchase this book &lt;3I recommend this book to people who feel like their life isn't worth living, or people who are going through a hard time. This book is meant for everybody, but I think that people biting it would benefit from the wonders that this story has to offer. I really don't know what else to say, other that this is definitely the best book Ive ever read."
4," Today I am tackling one of the most emotionally draining books that I have read to date in 2014. My daughter introduced me to the book, and as we both have a love of literature I knew that she had made a good recommendation. She most definitely did!The Fault in Our Stars is a powerful, emotional, dynamic roller coaster ride from start to finish. What first grabbed my attention was Green's attention to creating characters that the reader could easily relate to. Hazel Grace Lancaster is not a typical teenager. Neither are her friends. When you have cancer, your life is no longer dictated by trips to the mall, the latest fashions, the next television fandom, the latest book series to be made into a movie, or any of the typical teenage concerns. Cancer is like a leash that leads you around. For Hazel she is constantly tethered to an oxygen tank. Grace would love to fly solo through life, waiting for that day when the cancer wins the battle. Her parents, however, want her to have more in her life than just them. They encourage her to attend a cancer support group on a more regular basis, thus she is introduced to the dynamic and funny, Augustus Waters. Augustus looks normal and healthy, he has charisma that makes him different than the usual group of attendees. When he compliments Hazel and draws her into a conversation, attraction is for the most part, immediate.The story is inspired by the following quote:The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, / But in ourselves, that we are underlings.This quote is from William Shakespeare's Julius Caesar. I will admit I found a different statement within the book, that seemed more befitting the title, but find this one equally intriguing.Green does a stupendous job of bringing together three teens who all have cancer, but still want to live life to the fullest. Each of them; Hazel, Augustus and Isaac; have different types of cancer, but when it comes to life they are all living the same day to day challenge of not giving up. The book is both humorous and poignant. The characters are the star attraction, buoyed by the words Green has strung together to develop a plot and story line that is not just about dying. Crying, that is something you should be prepared for. Stock up on tissue before you plan to read the book.I will admit I truly hated one character in the book, Peter Van Houten, the author of the book, An Imperial Affliction. The book has left a lasting impression on Hazel, and Augustus once he reads it. Together they aim to meet the author they both admire, but the man they meet is far from the person they had hoped he would be, he is a huge disappointment. I understand that he had to be the villain, but I really had an emotional hatred for the character. I highly recommend this book. I am also aiming to see the movie that is coming in June 2014. I admit a little uncertainty about the film, but am willing to remain open minded."
5," Okay.. I stumbled upon this book. I read the great reviews and bought it.  I got it and took it up to read before bed one evening.I read the first five pages or so and I slammed the book shut and exclaimed to my husband  You will NOT believe what this book is about! A young girl DYING from Thyroid cancer!  He laughed out loud and said you have GOT to be kidding! Only you would buy a book like that.. not knowing.You see the funny part is, I HAD Thyroid cancer and my mom died from it!  I am no stranger to it and it's not particularly  a subject I care to talk about too much.  That being said, I figured that this book came to me for a reason so I probably should continue on.. just not on that night. I finally did start the book and wondering every step if I really should read it or not.  I kept right on with it and got about half way through and thought it wasn't holding my interest enough or else I wasn't feeling it because I didn't want to feel it? Perhaps if I had been an innocent bystander, meaning not really knowing anything about cancer or Thyroid in particular, I may have felt differently? Anyway, I pushed on and I started to become interested and started having outburst of laughter while tears of sadness rolled down my face.  I have never read a book that did that to me before. It wasn't non-stop, but those times when I did do it made me continue on.  By the time I was 3/4 of the way through I thought I knew what would happen and I was pleasantly surprised.. for more than one reason. I could relate to the feelings of the kids.. having lost someone dear to cancer and from going through the utter terror and uncertainty myself... it was a mixed bag for me.  It was a very real book to me, even if most kids don't speak this way or that way... When I was finished with the book I was so very glad I read it...Just like Hazel, I was wondering how it ended after I closed the book... I wondered about it ...I don't want to spoil anything here.... it somehow gave me hope in some strange way... that somehow it all goes on, no matter how much you think it won't and no matter how much you HOPE it won't... meaning surely the world can't keep spinning without you. I think it was just very real and just how stinky life can really be sometimes. I had some serious laughs with this book... crying, sobbing laughs.  Do I think it was the best book I have ever read? No. Am I glad that this book found it's way to me, YES.  I am trying to convince my 16 year old daughter to read it.  She reminds me of Hazel, and her friend reminds me of Gus... I think she would enjoy it.  If you are on the fence, read it."
2,"’m sure that The Fault in Our Stars needs no introduction. It made a big splash a few years back when it was first published, won a bunch of awards and lots more praising reviews from many of its readers. Furthermore, it is now going to be a major motion picture event which will increase its audience exponentially. So, excuse me if I’m trying to “sell” you on a book that’s been pushed at you so many times before, but I would be wrong if I didn’t tell you how truly terrific it was.In fact, The Fault in Our Stars surprised me. I didn’t expect or thought I would enjoy it as much as I had, but I was curious enough to give it a chance, of which I’m glad. John Green delivers a beautifully poignant tale of teenage love, existentialism, and so much more. So don’t discount it simply as another tearjerker, about two cancer-stricken kids in love. The Fault in Our Stars is more than that; it is about living and experiencing life, even if only for a short moment, but then isn’t it always just a matter of time?  “What a slut time is. She screws everybody.”The Fault in our Stars tells a story of Hazel Grace Lancaster, a sixteen-year-old cancer patient. While attending her Cancer Kid Support Group, Hazel meets Augustus Waters, an ex-basketball player, who’ve battled a cancer of his own, and is now in remission. Augustus is honest and open; he wants to experience life, to live and feel, while Hazel, seeing herself as a ticking time bomb, shelters herself, minimizing the impact of the impending outcome of her disease. But, with charm and persistence, Augustus slowly wins Hazel’s attention and later love; their love story begins to unfold with a shared passion for a book…I wish I could come up with something profound and grand to tell you, but words escape me. I’m floored and touched by the emotional impact this book delivers. By it’s simple beauty. It is sad, angry, romantic, and cheerful, humorous, courageous, desperate and maybe even corny at times, but perfect in so many ways. The Fault in Our Stars doesn’t shy away from the ugly side of the disease, but also manages to find humor and light – excelling at this intricate balancing act.But as much as I loved this story and want to praise John Green’s writing talent, I don’t think this book is for everyone. Don’t expect a HEA – you have to embrace the eventuality of Hazel’s condition, even if it happens outside the “world” of The Fault in Our Stars. I know that many readers, myself included, yearn to know and want to be assured that the accepted Hollywood HEA comes, but there is a different lesson to learn here, and perhaps it’s more honest and important, than any “fairytale” could be…Recommended***For this and other reviews please visit Nocturnal Book Reviews."
4," This sorry took me into another world and made me see it differently as Hazel Grace has lived in. I am inspired because I never knew someone could live a life where one human being could feel loved drowning in pain. As her one lover Augustus Waters dies, I feel to my knees as he was apart of me and as Hazel Grace to a book she read over and over again and the author could ask such a question as Why do you care so much about a book? It's because you become the book as that is you as you are the narrator in the book that, that story is yours. Even though you never lived one page in the story, the story where at the end we don't even know when the girl will die or if she survives because one genius found a cure to her disease and you smile your hardness as if you will never get to meet such a brilliant author who never really was the narrator put portrayed a role as if he was . This story took me farther into the afterlife of most of my dead aunts &amp; uncles that died of cancer who fought like they could never fight before because they were so weak &amp; afraid if their guardian angels will fly them up to the gates of the almighty heaven. Oh as if anyone who reads this might think of me as some crazy book nerd. But actually this is my 3rd book I actually read all the to the end  . Just because this as the other 2 books it gave me a reason to live because it was if they were my little pages turn out into my life as everything said and done in this book could have me relate to the world I am living in. I am Abrinna but others call me Fashoo because I live 2 lives as Abrinna lives in a world were the reality is not reality. As Fashoo is a human being living in another human being controlling the ways of how this life will go and how it started but not how it will end because nobody knows how it will end therefore I am one human being living in another were reality is not real trying to control the the world with my unrealistic matters. I am going to write a book because I always wanted to. But I will never make a New York Best Sellers because I could never be a genius as you John Green and I hope one day you will take the time to read such a review as mine as I would not like to email you to send it to one person because I want the world to see that a human being like me is so indefinite in life and I have no clue what indefinite even means but  I love the word. My email is @fuzziwonder@gmail.com as a simple hello from you would amaze me for entirety ❤"
5,"mmediately, I loved this book, so much that I knew to take my time with it and handle all of its genius gently. It would have been easy for me to give this book 5 Stars, even only half way through it, but, I was patient. Now I just want to scream and let everyone know that they must read this book. Careful. It will knock you off balance. I was and still am captivated by the careful use of John Green's words and the manipulation of how those carefully chosen words approach the reader's emotions and psyche. Before I finished the first chapter, I was hooked by Green's raw, brutally honest, in-your-face, and intelligent writing style. There are so many rich and luscious sentences that I would love to stick in my pocket and pull out as needed. Here are a few quotes that I have neatly compartmentalized in my keeping-this-with-me-forever file. I've really cut it short for those who haven't read it.Sometimes, you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book.There will come a time when all of us are dead. All of us. There will come a time when there are no human beings remaining to remember that anyone ever existed or that our species ever did anything. There will be no one left to remember Aristotle or Cleopatra, let alone you. Everything that we did and built and wrote and thought and discovered will be forgotten and all of this will have been for naught. Maybe that time is coming soon and maybe it is millions of years away, but even if we survive the collapse of our sun, we will not survive forever. There was time before organisms experienced consciousness, and there will be time after. And if the inevitability of human oblivion worries you, I encourage you to ignore it. God knows that's what everyone else does.Because you are beautiful. I enjoy looking at beautiful people, and I decided a while ago not to deny myself the simpler pleasures of existenceI finished this book with these conclusions: A) Genius!, and B) Anything that John Green writes, I will read."
5,"f you don’t want spoilers for this book, I suggest you move on because there will be spoilers here.Now I think most of you in bookland have read this book already and there isn’t really much else anyone can say about it because its been talked about alot and there is even a movie coming out soon, but I’m going to talk about it anyway because I want to give me two-cents!I had to wait a rather long time after finishing this book to be able to start the review. I didn’t really have any words that made sense. I still don’t really have any words that make sense but here it goes.This book was really heartbreaking. This book had me on the brink of tears multiple times. Then at the end I cried. This book was really quite heart breaking.I go into this story knowing its about a girl who is dying of cancer. So in my mind the entire time I’m thinking its going to end with her dying because I have not read/listened/watched any reviews about the book cause I knew I was going to get to it eventually. So I was completely devastated that the person I thought was going to die the entire time is still alive by the end of the book and one of the only healthy people you meet at the beginning, my favourite character, the one most filled with life, dies instead. You also know that our main character is still going to die at some point probably not that long after the book ends.Hazel is a pretty good character. I can’t even begin to think about what its like knowing that your life has an expiration date that is years before most people an having to live with things constantly helping you breathe. Im sure that would make you grow up faster than most people, and make her kind of harsh and disconnected from everyone. She was the character I was suspecting and welcomed for this kind of story. The only thing I didn’t really like about her or the other child/teen characters is that they seemed a bit too wise at times. Just because they are dying doesn’t make them wise…I loved Augustus so so so much. He is really what made the book for me despite the fact I think his name is ridiculous. Pretty much all the lines that I highlighted in my kindle were from him and because I loved them. I think my favourite section of the whole book was when he was describing the swing set.“I must see this old swing set of tears immediately.”“That is one sad goddamned swing set.”“We gotta do something about this frigging swing set,” he said. “I’m telling you, it’s ninety percept of the problem.”I also loved the fact that they gave it to the person they gave it to because he said I just want them to go outside when he was talking about his children. And the book is full of funny lines like that which kind of makes it more heart breaking. Damn you good writing and characters, why must you be in such a sad book? My hear broken when I heard that Augustus was going to die.After I read the book I went straight away to go watched the trailer. I can’t believe how good it looks, I am so excited! I will read this book again and I plan on buying a paper version of this book so I can proudly display it on my shelf."
5," really love this book. Can't wait to see the movie so I can see if the movie can make me fall in love with the characters with the same ease the book did. I've never smiled so much while reading a book. Not inwardly being happy, but outwardly smiling the biggest smiles I'm capable of. I love stories that show what it takes to fundamentally change a person. A Christmas Carol does this. Scrooge is a mean and greedy old man. A ghost tells him that he is going to change him by sending three other ghosts after him. In the end, Scrooge is changed forever. Should I have said spoilers? Well, young Hazle was also changed. She had a certain outlook on life and her existence. And while there are no ghosts sent after her, forcing her to change, her transformation feels much more magical.I can easily say that this is my favorite book. I've been spreading the word to everyone I can. They need to read this book. YOU need to read this book.This book did make me cry. It didn't make me sad, but I held myself together because I'm a man!. Tears were steaming down my face, and my nose became clogged, snot threatening to roll over my lip. When you hear that, and you know that the book is about kids with cancer, you may think that this is a depressing story. Don't be fooled. Those smiles I told you about above. Those are the truth of this book. All the happiness I feel from the events of Hazel's experiences completely outshine the sadness I felt from her experiences. I hope that is true for the characters as well. And while I didn't write the book, upon reading it, those characters futures became mine once I finished the last page. And my characters will have sadness, but all the happiness will make it okay. They will think back and smile. Sad tears completely outnumbered by happy tears."
4," Let me preface what I am about to write by saying that I thought the book was beautifully written, among one of the best written books I have read in a long time.  The author managed to capture the emotion and the mindset of teenagers dealing with the normal events of life and, specifically, the difficulty of disease.  On many levels it was truly inspirational.That said, and I admit a personal bias, I would find it hard to recommend that my preteens read this book, and possibly even older children, because of the ever present weight of cancer in the life of the characters and their families.  The book really never had a moment of relief.  Yes, there were comic and intimate moments, but always infused with a relationship with cancer.  It seemed to me to be, certainly, very realistic, but that did not make it easier to read.So, I would have to recommend that parents make a careful choice as to whether this is a topic that their children are yet ready to handle.  For some, it may just be too heavy and, truthfully, too frightening.  Yes, it is the real world, but the question is, at what point do we want our children to have to face that reality?On a side note, again for the younger readers especially, the book does approach the very normal sexuality of teenagers.  It is not lewd or vulgar in any way, but it is something to consider.As for giving this 3 stars instead of 5, I can honestly say it was only because I am just not personally comfortable reading a book that is, from beginning to end, infused with the pain, the sadness, the heartache, and, yes, fear of disease and death.  In every other way, it would have earned my top rating, but, honestly, I read this book because my 12 year old granddaughter read it and asked me to do so (by the way, she loved it!).  Typically, for me, I would be unlikely to read a book or go to a movie with this being the topic."
5," The book, The Fault in Our Stars by John Green, is worth a five-star rating because it is so touching and entertaining for young readers. The book is about young love, cancer, and sticking with each other through rough times. The story involves two main characters, Hazel Grace Lancaster and Augustus Waters, who are younger than 18. The book is easy for young adults to understand. Along with some sad scenes in the book are moments of humor and happiness. This makes the book unpredictable and entertaining to read.I agree with a prior review that was written about this book, a review Will made from Tennessee in 2012. He wrote that the book contains honesty, humor and grace, and he recommended the book to young adults. I also agree with him because this book is not just about dying but also about truly living.My favorite character in this book has to be Augustus Waters. The reason is because he is such a caring, loving, and strong guy. He is recovering from Osteosarcoma and has lost his right leg. Augustus meets Hazel at a cancer support group and they fall in love. He invites her over all the time, drives her around even though he only has one leg and let Hazel become a major part of his life. Augustus took part in Make-A-Wish and went to a different country with Hazel to see their favorite author. Another reason he is my favorite is because when he found out his cancer had come back, Augustus decided to write their favorite author and ask if he could help write or finish Augustus’ letter to Hazel should he die.Most people going through what he is would never do half the stuff Augustus did to help make someone else’s life better. My favorite quote is “She is so beautiful. You don’t ever get tired of looking at her” (Green 313) said by Augustus. It sums up how much Augustus loves Hazel, how he really admires her and how he thinks she is beautiful in every way. The message in the book is important. I hope young adults choose to read this book because it is so moving. It can make a reader cry in sadness but also happiness."
3," An Open Letter To The Fault In Our Stars,So, thanks for taking my heart strings and turning them into a huge pile of scrap metal.  That was so nice of you book, super nice of you.  But who am I kidding, I refused to read you for years (literal years) which was one of the most ridiculous things I've ever done in my life.  Sure you demolished my heart, but you also brought so much laughter and joy and one of the best book boyfriends that I've ever read in my life to my door.  But let's not forget about Hazel and how awesome she was too.  Honestly, I have no complaints about you, at all.  Okay, the heart shattering wasn't cool, but I get it, so I'll let that slide.-The White UnicornWhy haven't I read any John Green books before.  This man is a genius with words and even better then that he's the master of dialogue!  Seriously, the conversations in this book were perfect.  They were real and they made you feel all the feelings in your soul.  It takes a really talented writer to handle dialogue like Mr. Green and I'm glad that I finally gave in and read TFiOS.  Sometimes being a rebel comes back to bite you in the butt, that's all I'm saying.TFiOS deals with cancer, but it's how Green deals with it that really makes this book something special.  He doesn't soak the book in depression, sure he dips it in every once in awhile, but that's to be expected.  The thing is that this book is full of insurmountable amounts of hope and laughter and snark and reality that will blow your mind away.  This book is hilarious, like hold your gut and gag on air funny.  These characters are witty as all get out.  It's really a beautiful thing, on so many levels.I also have to thank Green for creating one of my favorite contemporary male leads ever.  Augustus Waters is as close to perfect as it comes!  He's snarky, he's funny, he's got just the right amount of hero complex without it getting out of hand and he's the sweetest.  He was the perfect other half for our girl Hazel.  And I'm pretty sure that he's been stealing the hearts of girls all over the world.Speaking of Hazel, she's someone who I'd be friends with any day.  Being inside of her head for the whole book was really a privilege.  She was the perfect voice for this story.  She wasn't afraid to try to live her life as all of the side affects of dying were trying to get at her, but she also knew that her time would come at some point.  She had so much dignity as well as huge amounts of correctly used dark humor.But those two aren't the only people who will warm your heart in this book.  Hazel's parents are the coolest book parents I've ever read.  I loved that her dad cried so much.  And Issac was the best friend these kids could have had.  And how can we forget about Patrick and his ball-cancer?TFiOS is character driven to the max and it's executed so well that it still has a lot of action happening too.  Trips to foreign countries, blind video game playing and more exciting things get covered in the story.  Honestly, if you haven't read TFiOS, take a tip from me and dive right in.  Don't let the fact that you'll need a whole box of tissues make you miss out on this wonderful book!You can read this and many other reviews on my YA book blog  &lt;a href=http://thewhiteunicornfiction.blogspot.com/&gt;The White Unicorn!&lt;/a&gt;"
5," Having been a thanatology major (the study of death, dying, and bereavement), I am always fascinated with reading about how people handle death, whether those people are real or fictitious. No one ever wants to talk about or even think about the loss of a child (trust me, I lost a lot of people in my life when my daughter died suddenly). The protagonist in this novel, Hazel Grace, received a terminal thyroid cancer diagnosis before the novel begins, and she has not only accepted it, she is downright philosophical about it. The big fear that she keeps to herself is that she is afraid for her parents. What will become of them when they no longer have her to hover over and care for? Will they divorce? Will they even live through it? Hazel's circle of friends is mostly limited to a superficial BFF and other youth she has met in the support group her parents force her to attend.When she meets a fellow intellectual cancer patient, Augustus Waters, in support group, her life takes a turn. She opens up and shares her favorite novel (An Imperial Affliction) with him. The novel is the sole work of Peter Van Houten, a recluse who lives in Amsterdam and never answers his mail. Van Houten's novel ends abrubtly--in mid-sentence--presumably because its protagonist (Anna) has died. Hazel and Augustus bond over the novel and decide to go on a hunt for answers about what happened after the novel ended. What became of Anna's mother? Did she marry the Dutch Tulip Man? Did she survive the loss of her daughter? Did Anna die immediately or just become too sick to write?The journey for answers takes the pair (and Hazel's mother) to Amsterdam in search of Van Houten. They share their first kiss in Anne Frank's house, which is described in immaculate detail. I devoured this book and found myself wanting more. Like An Imperial Affliction, The Fault in Our Stars leaves us with questions, but somehow we believe everything will be okay.I would highly recommend this book to almost anyone, except perhaps for a parent who is grieving a child lost to cancer -- and even then, it might bring some comfort. The tender love story is beautiful and sweet. The frustrations over things the characters can't control is palpable. Isn't that one of the common problems for all of us? We want so badly to control our fate, and yet fate has a path of its own."
5," This book…. I’m not even sure I can review this book adequately enough. This will probably be one of my shortest reviews. “I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and  then all at once.” Before I started reading, I knew it was a book about kids who have cancer. Depressing, right? Wrong. Well, somewhat wrong. Of course it was sad, but there were moments of joy, laughter, and love. *I’m cheesy, I know* This isn’t a book about kids who have cancer, or who are dying from cancer.. NO. This is a book that shows how deep love can go when you’re truly living.Anyway, the book revolves around Hazel Grace Lancaster and Augustus Waters. The thing I loved most about this book is how real it felt. This book is a legit emotional roller coaster. I’ve seen a few reviews that remark on how the dialogue between Hazel and Gus doesn’t seem real for teens. But I think it works well in this novel because these teens have seen and felt so much in their short lives struggling with cancer. They had to stop being children earlier than they should because of their diseases. The love story between Hazel Grace and Augustus was one of the best love stories I’ve read in a while. Some people, once they are terminally diagnosed, try to live life to the fullest, and others decide that since they are dying they may as well get on with it. HG and Gus know they aren’t going to live long but that doesn’t stop them from loving each other. This story doesn’t end like a sappy romance novel, but I still enjoyed it. It isn’t your typical YA novel, either. These kids are dealing with more pressing issues than “who is going to be prom king?” They are dying, they have to think about death clothes and hooking up G-tubes and oxygen tanks and trying to keep their hearts beating and their lungs breathing! Gus wants to leave his mark on the world, be remembered by/for something, but Hazel could only care about being remembered by Gus. This was an emotional novel, but not one that left me feeling completely void of happiness. I recommend you read it, NOW! Okay? Okay."
2," This won't be the most in-depth review ever, because I'm currently bawling my eyes out.WARNING: this book contains sad material, and you are almost guaranteed to cry. If you are scared of death, I would suggest you read this. If you want to see what it's like to be someone facing death at every twist and turn, read this book. If you are scared of oblivion, read this book.The past day I have referred to this as: The Cancer Book. But I now believe that title is inaccurate, because this book is so much more. It will make you laugh, cry, contemplate the existence of everything and confuse your mind so much with its big words. But most of all, it will give you a unique perspective of the world. I shall, from here on in, refer to this book as The Changer Book. This book has irrevocably changed me.I could put the goodreads blurb in, but if you want that you can find it yourself. This book is about a kid. Yes, a kid. A 16 year old girl with cancer. Yes, cancer.This is the point you stop reading. You go, eeew cancer. Bad thing. I won't read this. If you stop there, you are an idiot, excuse my French.This kid has a life-threatening disease and Is skating on thin ice every. Single. Day. Think what it would be like to be connected to an oxygen tank, have a cannula attached to you, have your parents worry over you, not go to school, and be constantly right in front of death.If you made it through the last stop reading point, then this is the next one. You go: oh no, death. I don't want to die. Kids dying make me sad. I won't read this. If you stop reading, you are a coward. Take a chance. So many people actually &lt;i&gt;die&lt;/i&gt;  and you're afraid about reading about someone dying?!?This girl copes. She does. But her view of the world is interesting, the way she views her self is sophisticated, especially for someone of her age and stamina. Then she meets Augustus.Now, if the death and cancer didn't freak you, I'm guessing a love story will. That combination is a hard one to find in a good reader.As their relationship develops after their meeting at Support Group, Hazel develops as a person, as does Augustus. They grow and develop as the lean on each other, showing you the bright side of cancer, and what it's like to have someone not pity you.Hopefully, this will also be your Changer Book. I hope it changes your view of the world, life, and people with cancer or a disability. Think. I hope this book changes you."
5," This book has been on my TBR list for quite some time. I am so happy that we decided to pick The Fault in our Stars as the group read of the month. I think what gave me that extra push to read it was that I knew that my co-bloggers would be there and we could discuss about it afterward.Hazel and Augustus absolutely captivated me! My connection to these two amazing characters started from the moment they are introduced in the book, and I must admit that they are still very present in my everyday thoughts. I don’t want to give anything away about their story because you absolutely need to feel every single emotion that their beautiful love story will make you live. I read a quote a few months ago that stayed with me ''When reading, we don’t fall in love with the characters’ appearance. We fall in love with their words, their thoughts, and their hearts. We fall in love with their souls.'' This is EXACTLY how I felt about Hazel and Augustus. I laughed and cried with them. Oh, boy did I cry! Before I started reading it, I knew it was going to be a very emotional journey. This story is about two young people that meet at a cancer support group and fall in love. I got so invested in the story that I felt like I was part of it! I wanted to show my support and bring comfort to them just like I would with my loved ones. Their story is eye-opening. Hazel and Augustus talk about the way they see life with such honesty.Amazing work by John Green! His writing style is brilliant! Is it a sad story? Yes! I freakin’ balled my eyes out!!! But, what I will remember the most about this book is the inspiring story and the two beautiful young people that stole my heart. Reading The Fault in our Stars was a life experience that I will never forget! I can’t wait for the movie to come out and see Hazel and Augustus’ remarkable story come alive on the big screen. I’ll make sure to bring tissues with me. If I cry watching the movie trailer, I can only imagine what 1 hour + of movie will do to me. People who have not read this book have no idea what an emotional roller coaster ride this will be!I give, The Fault in our Stars, by John Green 4.5 inspiring, brilliant, realistic, honest, heart-rending stars!  I highly recommend this outstanding book!"
5," only cry occasionally with books. Normally it's not something I seek out, though I do welcome it if it happens. This book...ugh. I read it last night and through today, pausing my life. Here are some quotes from things I posted on Facebook while reading the book. They aren't exactly spoilers but they have a flavour of that, so be warned.The Fault in Our Stars. I feel like Karissa Richards recommended this before Tumblr did. A few pages in and I didn't need that heart anyway.Omg so other teenagers who were like me DO EXIST. DID. A touch pretentious and learned? Existential? Goofy? John Green, you are writing my high school self, except that I didn't have cancer.I can honestly say I have never written notes in a book like this on Kindle before.Also John Green is trying to kill me.JOHN GREEN STAHP. Also, note to Nicky Sparklepants, this is how you write tragic love.Oh. My. God. John Green also understands what it is like to talk to literary authors as a reader. I almost want to swear some kind of oath that I will never be like the an Imperial Affliction guy. Seriously. This is what a conversation between me and GRR Martin would look like.There has been ugly crying in the shower. And gasping. I taught myself to cry pretty a long time ago but this is nose-running, yelping, chest-aching kind of crying. I am not sure I remember the last time I cried like this but I think it was when my grandfather died. (Of cancer, as it happens.)Rational thought has veen cancelled for today due to facial rainstorms and John Green.So yeah. But is it *good*? Well, it's beautifully written, it's unsentimental in good ways but full of feeling and sincerity, it's honest, it's realistic, and it doesn't go for easy answers. In a word, it's brilliant. Buy it, read it, love it. I'm going to do that with all his other books now."
5," The Fault in Our Stars, by John Green, is a story that I will never forget.  It resonated deeply within me, and is a story that I connected with.  Hazel Grace, and Augustus Waters began to mean something to me. They weren't just fictional characters in a book. They represented real people, life, and situations. I saw myself in Hazel, and my mother in Hazel's mother. Mr. Greene did an amazing job of bringing these characters to life.What I loved most about this story was that even though it was devastating, and broke my heart, it also made me experience a wide range of emotions. I smiled, laughed, and swooned from the charismatic, charming, and one of a kind, Augustus Waters. Many truths were laid bare about Cancer, death, life, and love. Mr. Greene addressed what it's like to have a terminal illness, and how it affects the people around us. Certain medical terminology like Cannula, CPAP, PICC Line, and G-Tube, made me cringe, as it took me to a dark place when I was in critical care from Pulmonary Emboli. I related to Hazel Grace, because even though I didn't have Cancer, we both underwent many of the same procedures due to severe problems with our lungs.Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters really complimented one another. Hazel was raw, real, sarcastic, and genuine. Augustus was very positive, sweet, loyal, and romantic. Together, they shared the kind of relationship that many people dream of. They completely clicked, and just got each other. Yes, this story was sad, devastating, and heartbreaking. However, it was also real, beautiful, and full of life lessons. I highly recommend this story to people of all ages, male and female! I give The Fault in Our Stars, by John Green, 5 Unforgetable, Gorgeous, There will never be another story like this, filled Stars! This story is a priceless gift, and a book that everyone should read!"
5," read a lot of books. In fact, I read more books than most people around me would even believe. And, despite being an emotional person, I have never, in all my days and years of reading, read a book that made me cry. Not because I've never read emotional books, or they've never really moved me. They have. But all that emotion was on the inside, never externalized at all. So you can imagine my surprise to find tears running down my face at the end of The Fault in Our Stars. The characters are so real and so in love, yet it is hard to say it's tragic. When you only have a short time to live, the fact that you find that love at all makes the time you have that much more special. Any life is short. Finding the things and the people that make that time meaningful is really what makes that time worth it. The shorter the time you have, the more important it is to find the things that make that time worthwhile. Not to leave a mark or some significant achievement, but more like, are people glad that you lived? That's the message Hazel Grace's dad is giving her at the end. Are you glad you loved him? Are you glad he was here, even for the short time he was? Then his life was well lived and worthwhile.I've read some of the negative reviews (all after I read the book) and I would like to take a moment to respond to some of them.The characters aren't real teens. My answer? Get over yourself. If you only want to read about people who are just like you or your friends or the people you know, then you are missing the point of reading in the first place. Granted, I have not been a teen for some years now, but When I was, I knew several teenagers who talked similar to this. I have a cousin who is fourteen and her friends tell her she's intimidating because she talks about existential crisis and such things. Yes, there are educated, witty teenagers, not just the mall hanging, slang slinging cardboard cutouts that you see or read in most teen fiction and movies. And if you want a more qualified opinion than mine, look up the review titled From a teenage survivorSome complain about obvious metaphors, well, I say what kind of deranged idiot can't just read a story for a story? Why do you have to try to tack on all this extra meaning to what he's saying? If it means something more to you, great. But how do you know that what you got from it is even what the author intended? Ten different people can read the same line and get ten different meanings from it. Are you so arrogant that you are convinced that what YOU got out of it is the only thing that is right and is exactly what the author meant? What if he didn't mean it to be a metaphor at all? As I've said before, get over yourself.This book was excellent and I highly recommend it."
5," “There will come a time when all of us are dead. All of us.There will come a time when there are no human beingsremaining to remember that anyone ever existed or thatour species ever did anything. There will be no one left toremember Aristotle or Cleopatra, let alone you. Everythingthat we did and built and wrote and thought and discoveredwill be forgotten and all of this will have been for naught. Maybe that time is coming soon and maybe it is millions of years away, but even if we survive the collapse of our sun, we will not surviveforever. There was time before organisms experienced consciousness,and there will be time after. And if the inevitability of human oblivionworries you, I encourage you to ignore it. God knows that’s what everyone else does.”-Hazel Grace Lancaster, The Fault in Our Stars  What is it that I can possible say about this book? First off, it is true when I say this is the absolute best book I've ever read. I tought I'd seen literature at its peak, but not until I read this novel did I truly see what it means to be a purely fantastical author. Yes, I'd heard so much hype about TFIOS, but it wasn't until yesterday did I pick it up off the shelf of my school's library and actually read it.  Engrossed, enthralled, captivated, stunned.  What words can I say to describe the book I've just finished? Mr. John Green, you have a gift and talent like I've never seen before. I am thoroughly astounded at the absolute marvelous writing in TFIOS. Just because you hear a book is great doesn't mean it actually is. But this one time I can agree with everyone--The Fault in Our Stars is irresistably spellbinding.  Words are just words. Meaningless scribbles of ink or graphite on papaer. So why then, are books so enthralling? They are nothing more than pages of marks on paper.  I'll tell you why.  It is the one who writes the book that is able to turn those mere marks on paper, those words, into something else. It is a girft to be able to create a world of emotions, images, thoughts, feelings, out of words. Because when you are truly lost in the book, lost so far into it that you forget you aren't in that world with the characters themselves, the author has succeeded.  So many times I forgot TFIOS was just a novel, just bounded pages of a flurry or words. Mr. John Green, you have managed to undoubtedly succeed in creating a beautifully encaptivating, raw, honest, and emotional world out of your book.  Mr. John Green your words inspired me. They made me stop and think. The endless and deep quotes you have put into TFIOS thrilled and disturbed me at the same time. There is such a raw, honest truth behind those words that it makes me shiver. I was deeply surprised when, nearing the latter half of the novel, I began to cry.  Why did I cry?  I cried with joy.  I cried with pain.  I cried with amazement.  I cried because The Fault in Our Stars was the best book I've ever read. Mr. John Green, I congratulate you on being the first author to make me truly cry in reading your novel. As a sixteen year old teenager, TFIOS was written exactly at my level for others my age. I am pleased to have been utterly captured by your work of genius.  It's so amazing the complexity of humans and our emotional minds. TFIOS perfectly captured, molded, and blended those raw, dazzling emotions we all experience, and merged them into not just a novel, but a work of art we should all read someday.  Thank you, Mr. John Green, for showing me what a truly great author looks like. The Fault in Our Stars inspired me, made me shake my head in wonder, and think,  Wow. So this is what writing at its utmost finest looks like."
5," As a cancer survivor, and a survivor of the many complications of that cancer, I have read many cancer books. Books that glorify the ordeal of suffering  through illness, that make healthy people feel guilty for not being as strong and admiring the ill for their indomitable victorious spirit throughout this suffering. These books are frustrating, because they are misguided views for both parties.  This book is sincere and honest, as expected from a John Green novel, but this book is so perfect. Being sick is awful. You experience constant pain, severe physical pain. You throw up and other people have to clean you up because in your weakened form you are incapable of doing so. You lose your independence, your dignity. You are completely aware of your affect on the people you love most, how much your suffering causes them so much pain, and how taking care of you takes over their lives, and you know there is nothing you can do.  You suffer losses when you beat the cancer, and sometimes those losses are evident on your person. And people gawk and stare and pity you, seeing you as a less fortunate, giving you no credit for not just giving up on yourself and surrendering to illness. It is messed up. This book portrays that perfectly, but it hurts you, my friend. You will sob. But it is a beautiful book. There is so much truth and the emotions are captured perfectly. I don't know John Green so perfectly manages to capture the mind of a 16-year old girl, but let's just appreciate that he does. I had to put this book down for breaks in the four hours I read this book, because I have had the exact same thoughts as Hazel Grace and I needed to wipe my tears.  So I did worn you, but read it. Their story needs to be heard."
5," Let me start by saying that this is the first John Green book I have read. After reading just ONE of his books I feel confident saying that he is a literary genius. He is so in tune with today's young adults that it's scary. His wording is eloquent without being too technical. His insight is so unique.It's no secret that this book is about cancer. My father was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma 14 years ago. I'm able to keep track of that date fairly easy because I was pregnant with my oldest son at the time. I attended every-single-chemo-treatment....and it was brutal. Now I realize how selfish I was to think it was hard ON ME. Imagine how hard it was FOR HIM. Ugh....I'm an idiot. I now feel guilty for any time I debated about going, HE HAD NO CHOICE. That's what this book is about. John Green has somehow mastered the mind of a cancer patient.Hazel is seventeen. She was originally diagnosed with thyroid cancer, and it has metastasized in her lungs. She has been in and out of hospitals her whole life. She carries an oxygen tank and sleeps with a BiPAP machine. Her cynical view of life is a peek into her mind. She is a realist who tells it like it is. In short, I love her.Augustus Waters is also seventeen. He had a touch of osteosarcoma at age 15 1/2. He lost a leg from it. As he puts it, I'm on a rollercoaster that only goes up, my friend. And thus begins my love affair with Augustus Waters. He is handsome, witty, and loves video games. He is unique for a young man, he likes to read and has a strong belief in symbolism.These two meet in The Literal Heart of Jesus (a description of the basement in a church where the cancer support group meets). It's word use like this that makes this book bearable to read. If there weren't little injections of humor it would be too depressing to get through. Hazel and Augustus go on a journey that shows us how capable the human spirit is of resilience and unconditional love. They are only teenagers and they show us how to accept each other for our faults and our attributes. If these kids on the verge of death can do it, why can't the rest of us?I could go on for awhile about this book, but there's no one better to narrate it than John Green. It is a tear jerker, but will also make you smile in LOTS of places. Not gonna lie. I cried....A LOT. But it was a good cry, and I'm glad that I read it.It is poetic.Profound.Insightful.Read it."
5," The biggest thing I didn't mind was that the teenagers really don't talk like modern teenagers. These characters were supposed to be really literate and savvy. No problem with that. However, I did find them to be self-centered and entitled, which was not a side effect of cancer, but of their suburban upbringing. If they thought their lives were tough, what about the kids whose parents and insurance can't pay for expensive, experimental treatments? What about the kids whose parents' marriages break up over the stress? What about the kids who die almost immediately after diagnosis before their loved ones and the world really got to know them?However, it was a romance well worth reading about. It was about two people taking charge of their own destinies and dealing with their fate the best way they could. It was about taking a chance on love. It was about making decisions that otherwise wouldn't be made without a cancer diagnosis. It was enlarging one's support system and really being able to rely on the original ones. It was about how differently people react to the same situation.It was cathartic for me because I lost a sister too young to cancer as well. I got to a point in the book where it hit too close to home, but I pushed on because it reignited those feelings that are sometimes dormant. For me, it's like my pain is more like a paper cut, almost imperceptible but reading this made those bucket of tears come out. However, it ends optimistically, as a really heavy book like this should. In fact, it left me mesmerized hours and days after I read it. I found myself wanting to read or see a movie about an equally sad story mainly because I can release my pain through experiencing the pain of another.Can't wait to see the movie! I will go into it with no expectations and understand it is a different medium than a book. I will not get angry that it's not exactly how I pictured the characters and situations in my head nor that they had to cut out crucial scenes to fit into a 90-120 minute format."
5," Well, first things first.One: this book didn’t make me cry. I don’t know if there’s anything wrong with me for not ugly-crying or wailing at a decibel that would make puppies howl, but I didn’t cry. Everyone else said they cried while reading this book. I didn’t. I was sad, I was heartbroken, I felt despondent, and I kept wishing against all odds that the inevitable conclusion could somehow be avoided. But I didn’t cry. Is that a bad thing?Two: I didn’t connect with either Augustus or Hazel. Both are great characters with depth and they’re flawed as heck, but I just couldn’t connect with them on any level. In stark contrast, I absolutely loved, loved, LOVED Hazel’s parents, and Isaac. My heart bled for Hazel and Augustus, but I just couldn’t form a bond with them. I have no idea why, but it is what it is.The aforementioned points aren’t complaints. They’re only observations. The Fault in Our Stars was every wonderful thing I didn’t expect. I’ve wanted to read TFIOS so many times. In fact, every time I read a glowing review about it, I desperately wanted to pick up this book and start reading it. Alas, I was too chicken. For some reason I didn’t want to get drawn into the suffering of a terminal patient for whom there is no hope. During the very first chapter, though, I came to realize that this is not such a novel at all.No matter that I only connected with two characters (and not even the MCs), TFIOS is a phenomenal story. Whether it makes you cry or not is not what’s important. What you take from it after you’ve closed the book, is what is important. Though both Hazel and Augustus share a deeper insight and understanding about the disease that is progressively ending their lives, they are two very different people. Yet they don’t let their differences stand in their way of falling in love...and what a beautiful, evocative, romance they have!  But keep in mind that this is not just a love story. It is much, much more than that.The Fault in Our Stars is unprecedented in its uniqueness. Every theme explored in this novel gave me something to think about. It was written with compassion, an appropriate lightheartedness, and a profound understanding of the fragility of life. John Green is a marvelous author, and though I’m sure I might not enjoy all his novels equally, I’m so glad I was finally convinced to give this book a chance. You’d be too."
2," Hazel Grace Lancaster :“I’d never been anything but terminal; all my treatment had been in pursuit of extending my life, not curing my cancer.”“I’m like a grenade, Mom. I’m a grenade and at some point I’m going to blow up and I would like to minimize the casualties.”Augustus “Gus” Waters :“To be with him was to hurt him – inevitably. And that’s what I’d felt as he reached for me: I’d felt as though I were committing an act of violence against him, because I was.”The Fault in Our Stars revolves around the story of Hazel and Augustus, two 16- and 17 year old cancer patients who meet at a Support Group. Hazel has terminal cancer which spread in her lungs, forcing her to walk around with oxygen supply. Augustus is a cured osteosarcoma patient who had his leg amputated.Hazel and Augustus quickly become friends and more, deeply connected on a spiritual and intellectual level, especially through a book (An Imperial Affliction written by a certain Peter Von Houten). This book (fictional, of course) is an essential turning point in The Fault in Our Stars, because Hazel and Augustus desperately try to get in touch with the author in order to ask for a sequel, as it is the story of a girl suffering from cancer, which abruptly ends in the middle of a sentence.The Fault In Our Stars affected me deeply. It is not just an average doomed love story between two cancer patients. It is a reflection on life itself, on the meaning and contribution to it.How can you leave a mark when you are destined to leave the world at such young age?Or is it necessary to leave a mark in the first place, or is the footprint you will have left important in depth or in spread?Will your life have had a purpose other than hurting the ones that came to love you?Is there a deeper meaning at all related to the ordeal of cancer?And there's where Hazel Grace is different from Augustus. Whereas Augustus is concerned about leaving a mark, doing something heroic, Hazel Grace doesn't want to hurt and leave scars in the mind and life of her parents - and finally in Augustus' too, which is why she considers denying herself falling in love with him, in order to avoid casualties.Hazel Grace and Augustus are philosophers of the modern world. I am not quite sure John Green gave them maturity for their age as well as a strong mind. They are seeing things in a clearer, less obstructed way, perhaps clearer than anyone in a healthy state of mind might.“Because there is no glory in illness. There is no meaning to it. There is no honor in dying of.”The problem, is not suffering itself or oblivion itself but the depraved meaninglessness of these things, the absolutely inhuman nihilism of suffering.It is also a reflection on how cancer patients, especially at that age, could see the world around them – the way they probably hate the pitiful looks and the thought-inspiring speeches emanating from non-cancer patients, as well as the “conventions” around this disease (ie. in our memories, cancer patients are never moody or weak etc. – they are always strong, brave, full of life until the end, when actually, the patient itself feels like sh…)In the acknowledgements, John Green specifically asks not to investigate further on the origin of the characters in this book and wants The Fault in Our Stars to remain a work of fiction. But somewhere deep inside, the feelings he relates to and his writing seemed so immensely truthful, that I am sure he is very close to this topic… Or made a lot of research on the subject and has an extremely good sense of empathy.Even if the characters in the book wouldn’t have like me saying this – they were strong. Until the end, and greatly inspiring. Because despite of the metaphysical (and sometimes pessimistic) reflections is this book, they manage to take full advantage of their time and still find the ability to dream, laugh and love.I wish for every cancer patient to be as serene as Augustus and Hazel Grace are…All in all The Fault in Our Stars was a wonderful, tear-threatening, thought-provoking, anger/pain/joy-inducing and affecting read, which I highly recommend."
5," Okay, John Green prefaces this story with a disclaimer: don’t try to divine whether any facts hide inside this story—such efforts attack the idea that made-up stories matter.  Fine, BUT:Green also coined the phrase: BBTTR (books belong to their readers) which I feel trumps the above disclaimer, so, this review will examine why The Fault in Our Stars might be, in part, an allegory for John Green and his novel Looking for Alaska—and why I enjoyed it MORE because of that.(SPOILERS ABOUND - for both books)Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters are two cancer kids who share a star-crossed love.  Not any fault of their own, but the tragic alignment of fate, these two will never live long enough to grow their love into adulthood.  But wow, do they make the most of their little piece of infinity.  Their highlight: a wish-come-true trip to flower-petal-confetti-covered Amsterdam to meet the author they bonded over, Peter Van Houten.  (Enter John Green)Here’s the set-up: Van Houten wrote a novel (Hazel’s favorite novel ever) about a girl with terminal cancer, Ana.  Ana narrates her story and just as the book is about to climax with Ana’s mother’s wedding, the book ends midsentence implying that Ana died or became too sick to continue writing.  The ending is never resolved, and poor Hazel Grace is dying (pun intended, I’m shameless) to learn the fate of the remaining characters—she needs answers!  (Enter Looking for Alaska)The overriding theme in Looking for Alaska is the ambiguity of life.  Halfway through the book, the title character dies alone in a car crash: the question becomes did she kill herself or was it an accident.  The reader never finds out.  Visit John Green’s website and you will see that is a big fan question: what happened to Alaska?!  Green’s answer: he doesn’t know.  And that is the point: sometimes in life we don’t get answers.  Sooo…When Hazel and Augustus show up on Van Houten’s front step, all I could think was: she can never be allowed to find out!!  And, staying true to form, Green has a brilliantly pompous and aggressively alcoholic version of Hazel’s dream-author meet them at the door.  Not only do they NOT learn any secrets post-Ana, they walk away with a hard truth: don’t meet your heroes.Pushing the topic further, Green actually has Van Houten show up at Augustus’s funeral (this part definitely made me cry) to try and apologize to Hazel and tell her how Ana’s story ends.  But Hazel, wiser now about the ways of life and death and disappointing heroes, sends him away, ultimately embracing (even if she isn’t literally aware of it) Green’s maxim that BBTTR.So, here are some of the many beautiful things I’m taking from this book and that now belong to me:1. Their ball-less group counselor.2. Augustus’s love of violent video game themed novels (Spoiler: the good guy always survives).3. Isaac’s trophy-smashing fit before his eye-surgery which Augustus gleefully encourages.4. The orange-themed trip to the bone-sculpture where Augustus invites Hazel Grace to Amsterdam.5. Their dinner on the canal at Oranjee where everything tastes like heaven and champagne that was like6. tasting the stars.7. Their first kiss at the Ann Frank house, celebrating the life Anne Frank lost and the lives the two of them were trying to live to fullest.8. Their imperfect love-making which was actually perfect.9. They honest way that Hazel acknowledges that leaving a huge blazing mark on the world isn’t as important as leaving a mark on someone you love.10. Okay.Given my (wild) assumption that Van Houten and Ana are allegories for Green and Alaska, I secretly hoped that Hazel would follow suit and end her story midsentence, just like Ana.  She doesn’t, not exactly, but the book’s final words are (like life) abrupt and beautiful.Best Lines:  “My third best friend was an author who did not know I existed.”“Without Pain, How Could We Know Joy? … This is an old argument in the field of Thinking About Suffering, and its stupidity and lack of sophistication could be plumbed for centuries, but suffice it to say that the existence of broccoli does not in any way affect the taste of chocolate.”“Witness also that when we talk about literature, we do so in the present tense.  When we speak of the dead, we are not so kind.”“That’s why I like you. Do you realize how rare it is to come across a hot girl who creates an adjectival version of the word pedophile? You are so busy being you that you have no idea how utterly unprecedented you are.”“As he read, I feel in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once.”“Easy comfort isn’t comforting.”“I’m in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we’re all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we’ll ever have, and I am in love with you.”“Sometimes it seems the universe wants to be noticed.”“She walks lightly upon the earth. Hazel knows the truth: We’re as likely to hurt the universe as we are to help it, and we’re not likely to do either.”"
5," have been putting off reading this for a while now because I wasn't sure if I was ready for the ugly cry that I was sure it was going to cause, but now I'm wondering, why did I wait so long?!  The story opens up with Hazel Grace Lancaster, a 16 year old who originally had thyroid cancer but it has since moved into her lungs.  Her mom is worried about her being depressed and not having any friends, so she forces her to go to a support group every week for cancer survivors.  The group itself is extremely depressing, but she goes and stays quiet, occasionally communicating with Isaac.  One meeting there is a new boy, a hot boy, and he keeps staring at her, but why?  After all the treatments she's undergone, it has taken a toll on her body and she feels she's not all that attractive, but he seems to think different.Augustus Waters, 17, doesn't really need to go to these support group meetings, but he's there to support his best friend, Isaac, who has already lost one eye to cancer and may lose the other.  Augustus had cancer himself at one point, osteosarcoma, but he beat it...lost a leg in the process, but he did beat it.  He is immediately drawn to Hazel and can't keep his eyes off her.Hazel does her best not to let Augustus, or anyone else, in.  She feels that she is a grenade that is inevitably going to blow up and hurt everyone that cares for her, so she tries to keep the damage to a minimum - she doesn't want to let anyone get close to her.  No matter how hard she tries, Augustus finds his way in to her life, and into her heart.I absolutely LOVED this book and every single one of the characters.  I knew what was going to happen (just not who), and I was prepared to bawl my eyes out, but surprisingly I didn't.  I did cry, my heart broke in two, but the characters themselves made it better somehow.  I especially enjoyed the writing style and how the characters were kind of smart-assy and sarcastic all of the time, exactly my kinda people.  This was a beautiful story of love, support, and accepting the inevitable.  One of my favorite quotes from the book - What a slut time is.  She screws everybody.  Ain't that the truth..."
4," The Fault in Our Stars by John GreenGreat art, be it writing, painting or music has one thing and one thing only in common. It should make the perceiver feel something, anything. John Green did this for me. He made me take notice of his universe much like Hazel Grace is observing hers.On the surface it might seem that the plot of this story is about star crossed lovers. Young love snipped short. And it may be the plot on the surface. However it is much more. The true plot line can best be summed up with a quote from the tv series House Md. She thinks she can die with dignity. Nobody ever dies with dignity, they die in misery and if they are lucky they lived a dignified life.I spend the previous two weeks clearing out the house of my parents, my dad passed away more than 10 years ago. My mom less than three months.For a few months now I have been struggling with the very cheesy but apparent question -- what is it all for?  Why?  All that is left after two lifetimes exceeding a total of 150 years is....us. Me, my sister and brothers. This us, this we in our infinite universes, in the way we live and what we do with our lives is all that an accumulated 150 years has produced. Us. Faults, faulty human and scarred by life.Us. We are all still struggling with our loss and I can identify with Gus who needed to hear what he will remembered for. He wanted to know if he would leave a legacy, a scar or be a human hand grenade. Hazel is the one who observed. Who tread softly - who pondered and felt what she could while she could. So at the end of this book with the indignant death ever present in the plot.This book with it's theme wrapped up within legacy, this book made me feel. Made me watch my family cry, smile, even laugh. It made me feel and maybe, maybe if I am lucky my legacy would be light, would not be that of a grenade. Maybe it would be like a breeze. In an infinite universe, I can only hope.WaAr.http://www.amazon.com/Fault-Our-Stars-John-Green-ebook/dp/B007Z8ZKS2/ref=sr_sp-atf_title_1_2?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1391850647&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=the+fault+in+our+stars+kindle"
5," Seeing that a book's plot involves cancer is enough to turn even the slightest of hypochondriacs away.  Add to that the fact that John Green's The Fault in Our Stars is in the Young Adult genre, and most people over the age of 16 would probably move right past it in the bookstore.  But take it from someone in her 30s who just finished the book and loved it (and is a mild hypochondriac): this is a book you need to read.The plot concerns Augustus Waters and Hazel Grace Lancaster, the latter of which is the book's narrator.  They both had/have cancer, only Hazel's is a bit worse.  She reminds us regularly of her condition via her trips to the hospital, her bleak outlook on her future, and her oxygen tank (which she has named Philip), which must be attached to her at all times or else she struggles to breathe.It's at a cancer support group that she meets Augustus Waters, a former basketball player with a fake leg who once battled the cancer that stole it.  Augustus is instantly smitten with Hazel, but Hazel hesitates to entertain his advances because she knows she doesn't have a whole lot of time left.  Augustus is more of a seize-the-moment kind of guy, haven't looked death in the face and all, and he continues to pursue Hazel, even if it's just to be her friend.Hazel and Augustus trade their favorite books (he reads hers, she reads his), and they end up traveling to Amsterdam to meet her favorite author.  While this may sound like it's steeped in improbability, it actually works rather well with the story, and it becomes an experience to remember, that much is certain.Another entertaining character in the book is Augustus and Hazel's friend Isaac, a poor kid whose girlfriend dumps him when she finds out that he has to have his other good eye removed (after he lost the first one to cancer).  Isaac, however, has a great attitude toward his cancer, and he takes it all in stride.  He's even able to continue to play video games that work via voice prompts.  Just don't let your spiteful little brother come in the room and scream a command for your character to die.What makes this book so magical is that it can make even the most hardened of readers both laugh and weep.  The dialogue is more true to life than that found in a majority of books out there today, particularly in the young adult genre (a genre that this novel transcends), which has a tendency to either sugar-coat life or patronize the reader.Incidentally, The Fault in Our Stars will be coming to a movie theater near you in June.  Because Green was on set himself to supervise the film's production, the flick sounds like one to look forward to, and one that won't let us down by crapping all over our imaginations with a less-than-stellar adaptation.  With a touching read that's incredibly well written, heartfelt, and deliciously cynical, any author who can evoke the emotions you feel from this book deserves to have his work turned into a movie."
5," Here's a young adult novel about 3 teenagers with cancer, two of whom fall in love.  This premise may sound particularly unappealing, but think again.  Yes, it's a little weepy, but there's way more to it than that.  Our narrator is 16-year-old Hazel, who has terminal thyroid cancer that has spread to her lungs, forcing her to tote an oxygen cart around with her everywhere.  Augustus is her 17-year-old love interest, who has a type of cancer that most people survive, but he has already lost a leg to it.  Finally, there's Isaac, who brings the other two together at a support group meeting.  The author handles all this with such a deft hand and with such witty and intelligent dialog that I didn't even mind very much when he rather predictably turned the tables on us.  He never lets us forget that these characters have cancer, while at the same time making us love them for who they are—typical teenagers in many ways but wise beyond their years because they have to look at the world from a perspective that most of us don't have to experience.  The back story is Hazel's favorite book, a novel called An Imperial Affliction, also about a young person with cancer, that ends in the middle of a sentence.  She and Augustus manage to gain an audience with the author in Amsterdam in the hope that he will enlighten them as to what eventually happens to the characters in the book.  The big question, though, is this:  What's the point of loving someone who is about to die?  Given that death is inevitable and often unpredictable, we have to cherish every moment with those we love, and the author makes this point quite eloquently, without heavy-handedness.  He imbues his characters with a gentle thoughtfulness that draws our admiration and our compassion."
5," This is a book that I've had sitting on my kindle for a while now. It is one of those that I really wanted to read, but knew there would be tears and sadness. So, I kept putting it off because who in their right mind willingly goes into reading something they know will make them ugly cry like there is no tomorrow?! But then I saw the movie trailer and I realized, there is so much more to the story than just the sadness of it.So, I finally caved and started reading it. And yes, before you ask, I DID ugly cry something fierce. Reading about someone having cancer period is upsetting, no matter the age of the person. But when it is a child, it takes on a whole new level of grief. Especially of you are a parent. You never want to think something like the C word could happen to your child. But it can. And it does for so many.Despite the difficultly of the subject matter, I am glad I read the book. I know it sounds crazy to say that after admitting I shed many tears, but reading it meant I got to experience Gus and Hazel's story. THAT made the tears worth it. They are characters that will quickly steal your heart. For me, it wasn't because they had cancer, it was in spite of it. They were so wise beyond their years at many times. But also very much still teenagers.Now that I have read the book, I am a bit scared to see the movie when it releases. Although the trailer for it IS what got me to finally give in to reading the book, I am scared it won't live up to what I imagine in my head. I will probably wait it out to see what initial feedback there is from my fellow book lovers.If you have been putting TFIOS off, I highly recommend taking the plunge and reading it. Yes, there will be tears. But truly Gus and Hazel are worth every single one of them that you will cry."
5," Hazel Grace and Augustus are teen cancer patients who meet at a support group for cancer survivors. Hazel Grace's lungs are so poor that she walks with an oxygen tank and nasal cannula during the day and has to sleep hooked up to a machine that drains fluid from her lungs and helps her to breathe at night. Augustus has lost his leg to cancer. His best friend, Isaac, lost his eyesight to cancer. I loved the character of Hazel Grace. The literary teen role model police might have some issues with her, but I think she's very real in the sense that she is a typical angst ridden teen. She gets frustrated with her parents. She secretly resents the healthy looking cancer survivors in her support group and wonders why they get a miracle while she doesn't. She's not really fighting cancer like the euphemism suggests. She's already resigned herself to the fact that she doesn't have long to live and that cancer is a battle that she can't win. All the medicines and machines do is buy her a little more time.  Time that she learns to value over the course of the book. When it starts, she's living each day preparing herself for the fact that she's going to die soon. That's not really living. Toward the end, she starts to actually and literally live each day. That's what I loved most about this book. It's a cheesy sentiment, but that age old question of Are you dying to live or living to die? (2Pac song lyric!!) is profoundly true, in my opinion.I readily admit that my opinion of this book is based primarily on how it made me feel and it's ability to make me feel rather than on any technical aspects of how well it was written. The book probably does have issues that a more discerning reader might find fault in. I can understand why some say that there is too much purple prose or that the characters are flat or that the teen voices of Hazel Grace and Augustus seem a little stodgy and off. Despite that, I'm still inclined to say that if someone had the ability to read this book in it's entirety and not feel any empathy toward the main characters, something may be wrong with them."

Dutton Juvenile. Kindle Edition.I hesitated many times to pick up this novel, at first, because everyone was commenting that even though it was a profound, unique love story, it was going to be a tough reading; that one has to be prepared to cry. I had just finished reading “Me Before You” by Jojo Moyes (I cried many times), and I was still debating whether I was strong enough to plunge right away.I took courage, started and let me tell you that it wasn’t what I was expecting. The story was not really about their sickness but rather about their ordinary, normal life with unique circumstances. It portrayed how people with cancer lead a normal life as much as possible and did the best they could everyday. “You’ll . . . you’ll . . . live your best life today.

5," This book was great. That being said, there are spoilers in this review, so don't read it if you haven't read the book. Just read the book, truly.I loved Augustus and Hazel... real, fictitious, wonderful characters. I cried, as my friends told me I would, but not as much as I cried at the deaths of my own characters. I'll admit, as an author, I put off reading this because I was afraid your depiction of death would be better than mine. I'm not saying mine was better. I'm just saying I shouldn't be comparing myself to you because of course death of a character I gave birth to would be harder. I appreciated the Van Houten character. While I'm not an alcoholic, I see bits of myself in his crazy ways... although he had good reason. I do not.Anyway, I guess this should be about the book more than about how I feel after the book. Or should it? Maybe so. We'll go with that. I knew the spoiler before going into it, so it was never a question of who or what, but when. That was enough to keep me cautiously enthralled in the story. Hazel was refreshingly smart and quick-witted, a rarity among the books I've read recently. Thank you for depicting her as a strong and honest human. I adored her. And Augustus? Our time with him was not long enough, which means you, Mr. Green, did your job well. He, too, was wise beyond his years. I write characters like that, too, so I have a great appreciation for them. I thought their love story was beautiful, tasteful and true. Maybe it wasn't factual, but a) I have no experience with cancer, so I don't know, and b) it's FICTION. We get to suspend reality for a bit. How grand!Thank you, Mr. Green, for this book. This is the kind of literature people should be reading. You elevate the genre. You've done well. You've made your mark. You'll be remembered. Okay?"
2," Michelle's Review: (scroll down to read Meghan's review too)I must begin by saying that my 17 year old daughter Meghan, requested this book for Christmas. She started reading it as soon as she unwrapped it, and finished in a day and a half. Surprisingly, my 13 year old non-reader daughter Payton, read it after her sister, in 2 days. WOW!! That in itself was a HUGE feat and I just knew that I had to read it. I am extremely happy that I did.The two young characters in this book are Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters. These children both have life threatening, although different types of cancer. Hazel and Augustus are beyond wise, beyond their time, although down to earth, normal life living teens.The two start off as friends and that friendship turns into one amazing, phenomenal love story. Augustus would do anything for Hazel Grace. He would give his life for her. Augustus knows that the one thing at the top of her list, her dying wish is to meet her favorite author. What Augustus does to make her wish come true is exuberant. It's extraordinary and he thinks of it as just making her happy.Augustus does what every man who is on love would do. That is to make Hazel Grace happy and to see her smile. I am not going to lie ... This story is heart breaking, yet a heart felt read. I HIGHLY recommend that everyone read it. After you have read it, pass it onto a friend and let them read this beautiful, feel good love story.If I was able to, this book would be rated a 10 by me. Please read this book, you will be very pleasantly surprised by the intelligence of these children and the incredible love that they feel toward one another. I know that it has been out for quite some time, but I am glad that I finally broke down and read it. I dare say this is my favorite book of 2014. Even though the year has just begun, I must say it's going to be very hard to beat. Well done Mr. Green!!Meghan's Review:The Fault In Our Stars is a tear jerking story that involves two brilliant teenagers, Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters. Hazel and Grace met in a support group meeting for cancer patients. It was the illness that brought them together and it then grew into a beautiful and powerful romance. Hazel doesn't like to be called Hazel Grace, but accepts it as long as it is Augustus that is saying it.One of their lives were deprived due to the illness that took control of their body. Augustus's love for Hazel Grace is so strong that he used his only wish to fulfill her life long dream. His wish took them on an adventure to Amsterdam, where they had their first kiss. This is where they realize that what they feel for each other is true love.Author John Green is brilliant. He writes his characters as very intelligent teenagers. He incorporates real life dilemmas that most people can relate to. The message that John Green portrays is to love the people in your life and not take life too seriously, or for granted. You just never know what tomorrow holds.This story is so great that I didn't want to put it down and I hated that it was over. The only thing I didn't like was the ending. I needed closure and didn't feel that I received that.I recommend this book to anyone, young or old. It will capture your heart. Be prepared with a box if tissues because you will need it!!"
5," “My thoughts are stars I cannot fathom into constellations.”So... I wasn't sure whether or not I wanted to write a review for this book because, well, it's The Fault in Our Stars and it was beautiful, sad, gorgeous and real. Also my first John Green book and so many people had read it already and I don't usually read this genre — realistic young adult fiction — at all, especially not this topic, but I have to say I was very surprised by how much I ended up loving this book. So I really need to say THANK YOU to my friend Em for gifting it to me.“As he read, I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once.”Ah, where do I start? I was really impressed by the exquisite and stunning writing of John Green. But it was more than that... it was also the characters and not just the main ones, Hazel and Augustus. Although, of course they played a pretty big part. I just mean that the main characters as well as the secondary characters made this book its perfect whole.Also I loved Hazel and enjoyed reading in her point of view and how she slowly fell in love with Augustus. It was something special. And Augustus? Well, he was something else. I would lie if I said I didn't fall a little for him too. Such an amazing characters. I also liked his friend Isaac, though I felt real sorry for him most of the time. Also characters worthy to mention would be Hazel's parents. I don't know why but I really liked those people!“The world is not a wish-granting factory.”And then there's the story. This beautiful and sad story. It's more than just a cancer story, it's a romance and damn it if I wasn't totally swept away by Hazel and Augustus' love story. But all good things come to an end and yes, I did cry (which I don't usually do with a lot with books) so that says a lot for me and how into this book I was.“That's the thing about pain, Augustus said, and then glanced back at me. It demands to be felt”Funny at times even though a sad but beautiful story, The Fault in Our Stars really did something for me. I loved it, even if it's not my usual genre or topic. The book altogether was something gorgeous. The writing was stunning and the characters each special in their own way. I can't press how much I would recommend this book to anyone who hasn't read it yet. I mean it. Read. It. Now."
5," only downloaded this because it was selected for the book club I attend. This is in no way a book I would have chosen myself, despite being a best seller. In fact, a book being a best seller has very little weight in gold to me.I. Love. This. Book. I have read so few books twice, but already I want to reread this one. What do I love about it? The simplicity of the story, because after all, isn't life utterly simple, depending on the viewer? Hazel Grace indeed views life (and death) to be almost painfully simple. I don't believe in spoilers in reviews, but I will say the realistic dark undertow and turn of events is almost refreshing. This is not a feel-good story about romance. These are children dying, and families dying (in a sense) with them. This is about children who are merely buying time, and the prices they pay just to better their odds of living another year, knowing they will never grow old or have children of their own. They're struggling to make peace with their deaths, as well as the reality of what happens afterwards (here on Earth, I mean.) This is about human nature, both in its glory and in its wretched artificial sweetness.Easily my second favorite aspect of this book was how the author captured human characteristics perfectly and with such perfect balance. There are people we love, people we hate, people we love to hate and those we feel bad for hating. The main character, Hazel Grace, is not concerned with leaving her mark on the world as so many people are (myself included). She is concerned with minimizing damage done by her death, going so far as calling herself a grenade. She sees the pain caused to others as other cancer patients die, and she sees families torn apart. She also sees how artificial people can be, the deceased gaining renewed interest in those who had otherwise long since forgotten them during their battle with cancer. (How we have an aversion to sickness, but nothing like death to bring about an onslaught of long lost friends.)This book is cheeky, funny, sweet, and sad. It's very cynical, blunt, dark, and honest. It's relatable, insightful, disgusting, and romantic. This book is wonderful.(I would also like to point out, this book was very well written. It is surprising the number of books that get released with ample amounts of spelling and grammar mistakes that, if the author couldn't catch, then surely the editor should have. This piece of work was quite refreshing in that regard.)"
5," 3.5 starsThis book left me breathless and at a complete loss for words. I don't know how to even begin to put my thoughts into words, but I'm going to do my darndest. Going into this book, I knew it was a cancer book. I was made sure I was prepared for the emotional warfare that John Green was about to bestow upon me. I had a good supply of Kleenex, a pillow to cry into, ugly comfy clothes, and lots of chocolate. You guys, I knew this was going to be emotional, but I had NO IDEA just how jack up I would be in the end. The book wins the award for Best Ugly Cry Fest. I was a complete wreck. No other book has made me cry this hard.Okay, now that I've discussed my snotty, ugly cry, I'll talk about the book. Okay? Okay. (*sniff sniff*)Augustus Waters and Hazel Grace are two fictional characters that I will never forget. As professional sick people, both have had to stare death in the face at such a young age. They are remarkably mature and have an interesting outlook on life (however, short theirs may be). Augustus buys cigarettes, but doesn't smoke them (a walking metaphor). Augustus makes cancer jokes, but the reality of it all is anything but funny. Hazel Grace's lungs work the way they're supposed to, and Augustus has one leg. Both characters take this horrific, gut-wrenching situation and somehow make it less foreboding and depressing. See, the funny thing about cancer:Cancer is not all that bad really, it just wants to be alive.Yes, cancer is the antagonist in this tearjerker. You have been forewarned. If you are one of those people who avoids Nicholas Sparks's books because someone always dies in the end, I beg of you to read this book. I'm not saying anyone dies, but the journey these characters take together is wonderful. If anything, the writing alone is reason enough to read this book. As I read, I felt like I was getting an education at the College of Sentence Artistry taught by professor John freaking Green. I say this in a non-self-deprecating way: there is no way on God's green earth that I would be able to craft a sentence like John Green. The man is a genius.This story and the characters made me feel. By the end of the book, I was gutted, emotionally raw, and strangely happy. Even with all the talk of death, I was left with a feeling of hope. Augustus so desperately wanted his life to mean something, to leave a big mark. But Hazel helped him realize that perhaps he already had left his mark. He fell in love with Hazel Grace and helped her and many others live their life to the fullest. Hazel and Augustus lived beautiful lives, despite being hunted and haunted by death.Why are you looking at me like that?Because you're beautiful. I enjoy looking at beautiful people, and I decided a while ago not to deny myself the simpler pleasures of existence.Though the subject matter of this book is doom and gloom, it is surprising funny (or maybe not-so surprisingly funny if you're a John Green fanatic. The man is hilarious). Augustus's quirky view of his own life and illness was what made me smile. Augustus's and Hazel's banter back and forth had me laughing out loud and envious of their wit and comedic timing. And if all this praise isn't enough to get you to read this book, there is Venn Diagram humor.I didn't tell him that the diagnosis came three months after I got my first period. Like: Congratulations! You're a woman. Now die.Kissing someone so that you can get a free trip is perilously close to full-on hooking, and I have to confess that while I did not fancy myself a particularly good person, I never thought my first real sexual action would be prostitutional.Green has written a love story, but TFioS is so much more. It's a story about tragedy and what you choose do with it. It's a story about two people who have been dealt a crappy hand who choose to forget about winner and just play the game."
5," This is the story of teenagers who fall in love while battling cancer. They have lives that have irrevocably changed by this terminal illness which is heart breaking kn a real life sense. But low and behold this is a fictious book. In my mind I thought wow we have mature young adults who can articulate themselves. And then they kept talking and I quickly changed my mind. They used sarcasim non stop which I found unrealistic is 90% of the situations it was used in. I dont know where this book went wrong for me , but I found myself just wanting it to emd because of the monotonous attitude in the book. I just knew what was going to happen Nd became very bored which is the last thing I want while reading a book. It was unbelievable to think that this girl who said she was a homebody and never talked to anyone to just randomly see a guy who stares at her smiles then invites her over? Yeah sure...... Hazel made herself out to be akward in the beginning but then she had no issues with this guy his friend or his family and relating to them. It just seemed incredibly forced to me. The suthor brought in Hazel's one girl friend which was a complete waste of space it did not contribute to the story what else besides attempting to possibly show that she told her friend she was leaving so she could be alone.... which made no sense because her motherwas at the mall watching her... well Mr. Author that was obviously an oversight on your part. Her favorite author also added no dimension to the story what so ever. Hazel made herself out to seem mature but then she was incredibly childish when it came to meeting him and wanting answers about a hamster......Well I will stop my rambling but I could go on and on with more examples of inconsistencies and realistic behavior in young adults with cancer.... I wish I could explain my feelings better than that but after finishing the book my is at that place where I am just so confused on all the good reviews."
3," This was the first book I've read in many years that wasn't in the fantasy genre. I do not regret reading this. In fact, I couldn't put it down. I read the entire book in a single day. It was that good.The characters feel real and are very likable. The romance doesn't feel flimsy or forced; there is real chemistry between Hazel and Augustus, which is rare in novels with young adults as the main characters. They may be young in age, but they are old souls due to their life experiences from fighting cancer and everything that comes with it. I don't want to label this book as a young adult novel because I don't feel like it was written for young adults. I feel like it was written for anyone and everyone, yet the vernacular and philosophical musings seem aimed more at adults than youth. Just my opinion. I, an adult, thoroughly enjoyed this on an intellectual and philosophical level I couldn't have attained in my youth.This book made me laugh and made me cry. Unfortunately more of the latter. Again, I do not regret it. As someone dealing with chronic physical pain and health problems I related to these characters and their plights. The author shines a light on the ugly and lesser known side of physical suffering as well as the emotional turmoil and pain that accompanies it. Yet there is beauty and life within this book about dying. The relationships and conversations between the characters are often funny and thought provoking. It begs you to take a step back and look at life in a different light. Notice the universe, if you will.The author doesn't waste words. It might seem slow paced to some if you're used to a book with more action, but for what it is I feel it is very well-paced and draws out more emotion from the reader. It drew me in and made me feel for the characters as if I knew them in real life.I highly recommend this book."
2," met John Green before I had read any of his books, on a humid summer day, at a book festival in Philadelphia. I was dating this girl, and he was one of her favorite authors. She desperately wanted to see him, but she had some silly work obligation that she felt too guilty to get out of. A Knight of Infinite resignation she was (yes, I snuck in a Kierkegaard reference, for you nerdfighters), though I'm sure she grew out of it. I wanted her to grow out of it faster. Which is to say I wanted to sleep with her.I was feeling self important as 26 year olds are wont to feel, and this was increased both by the humidity and the fact that the average attendee earnestly awaiting their signed copy was about 15. I bought Paper Towns and an Abundance of Katherines and asked them to sign it for her and proclaim me a pirate king. You have doubtless done stupid things to get laid, and this was one of mine. John refused to say I was a pirate king, but displayed remarkable patience at dealing with my exasperating younger self.The point of this story, which you should rightfully be wondering, is that John Green has a conscience, and an adherence to the truth that comes through in his every word. He will be silly, he will err, but something happens when that man puts pen to paper, and it is something that prevents him for lying.I picked up this book after dreading it for months. I googled the synopsis, and read parts of it backwards, like the coward that I am. If you have ever known someone battling cancer and illness, the pain is so great that the threat of it, and the sheer weight of it, seems unbearable. I didn't think the truth of it could be captured so well, and I'm convinced Virginia Woolf would have been pleased by this rendition of sickness. The sheer beauty and joy of the book is so great that you will perhaps identify with the parents the most, for having the opportunity to glimpse into the lives of these characters, and you will be hard pressed not to notice, care, and soften towards other people in its wake. Which is the true spiritual test of great literature.Please, please, read it."
5," “That’s the thing about pain,” Augustus said, and then glanced back at me.“It demands to be felt.”The Fault in our stars has been a book that I’ve been hearing wonderful things about. When I finally had the chance to actually read for leisure I quickly brought this one up. After reading it I must say that although a wonderful story I was not blown away.Hazel is a 16 year old girl who has been living with lung cancer for three years. Since she is not able to attend school her mother insist that she join a support group with other children that have cancer. But Hazel despises the idea of having to sit in the sessions and hear over and over the same stories from their leader.The day that Augustus accompanies one of the group members to session, Hazel is captivated by him. When she finds out that Gus is actually one of the few that is survived the “illness”, she admires his courage and charisma. But most of all, his determination not to let his situation make him bitter and angry.The two quickly find a friendship and love in their relationship that none thought possible.But then tragedy strikes for one of them.“You gave me a forever within the numbered days, and I'm grateful.”Hazel and Augustus aren’t two normal teenagers. No matter how much they want it, they both are battling a sickness that is incurable. Experiencing the POV of a teenager suffering through this sickness makes this a heartbreaking read. No matter how much you want to fall in love with the characters and for them to live HEA you know that this story just doesn’t end that way. Nonetheless, The Fault in Our Stars does make you fall in love with the characters and takes you on a sad but beautiful journey. There were parts that had me tearing up and many that had me smiling.Now there is the argument that the theme of this book has been done many times over and didn't have anything unique in storyline. Sadly, I agree, only because at the end of the book it just didn't feel like a book that I would read again. Although I liked it, I was bored after a certain part and couldn't connect with Hazel on any level throughout the book. The other characters I did connect with, particularly Augustus. I loved everything about him and his character was the easiest to connect with.Overall, a wonderful read. I would recommend that you read it and experience it for yourself.Happy Reading!"
5," Every once in a while I read a book that hits me so hard it knocks the breath out of me. This was one of those books. It took me some time to collect myself enough to sit down and write this review, because John Greene is simply a genius, and I can only hope to do his book justice with these few paragraphs.Sixteen year old Hazel Grace, because of a miracle drug, has been able to fight cancer and live longer than anyone expected her to. She lives day in and day out with the knowledge and the fear that her condition could worsen and cut her life short. She’s also not a regular teenager since her normal routine consists of medical treatments and attending a cancer support group. It is at this support group that she meets Augustus Waters. Augustus is immediately smitten with her and the two of them start a friendship that throughout the story blooms into a romance.Augustus Waters also has cancer, although he has been “NEC” (No Evidence of Cancer) for a few years now. As a side effect of his ailment, he lost part of one leg and now walks with a prosthetic. As a former basketball player and as a result of his charismatic personality, Augustus has no trouble making friends and being liked. Although it’s apparent that Hazel and Augustus very much like each other, Hazel is cautious about not starting a relationship with him. Since she considers herself to be sicker than him, she doesn’t want to be the “grenade” that explodes and leaves shattered hearts on everyone that loves her. As a result of a chain of events in this story, Hazel and Augustus end up traveling together to Amsterdam to meet the author of a book that Hazel idolizes. During this trip their relationship begins to transform as the harsh reality of their condition begins to hit them head-on.I recommend that you read this book with a box of tissues in hand, because not only will you will fall in love with the characters and will suffer with them through their hardships, but you will also fall in love with their love. The level of emotion that this book brings out is very deep. You do not have to be a cancer victim, survivor, or even to have known someone with cancer to understand and feel what they are going through. It is painfully realistic and delightfully uplifting at the same time. A combination that in this case is pure gold. 5 stars all the way."
5," A very interesting approach to the story of a modern young woman in the throes of cancer, surrounded by her support system consisting of those suffering from varieties of the same death sentence.  It is a young adult novel, which I don’t often find myself reading save for this being a choice in a community-wide read that I am on a committee for.The best part of this book is it’s semi-sweet cynical humor found without - a very morbid, realistic view of life at the end of life and at the beginning of life, the young narrator brings us along her journey of love and self discovery, all the while trailed by the expiration date they all must face eventually.I liked the pacing and the friendly language, but the true art in this piece is Green’s portrayal of the narrator and how she tells the story.  Brilliantly written and engaging for young audiences - and I could easily see how this did (and continues to do) so well.  I have a few complaints about the believability of a few things - namely the way the characters used profanity (didn’t seem as natural where it occurred to me, for some reason) and also the author’s work who is a centerpiece to the novel.  He was a believable character, but the work wasn’t for some reason - i.e. as a writer I don’t see someone writing a book that doesn’t have an ending even getting published, and the plot outlined in the book is significantly less believable in the language it is written, even though the one in your hands as you read is believable.While I saw the ending coming from a mile away, I could see how everyone who read it reviewed it as an absolute tear jerker.  There were some gorgeous lines interspersed in the overall piece of popular fiction, but it was a good read, and I will be recommending it to the rest of the committee."
5,"t took me a million and one years to finally pick up The Fault in Our Stars. Honestly, I think I put it off for two main reasons: 1) I thought the cover was boring, and 2) I just wasn't into cancer books. But after reading and LOVING Maybe One Day (an amazing and heartbreaking cancer book), I knew I had to give The Fault in Our Stars a chance.I love how such a big part of this book was the characters connecting with a book. It's like a book inside of a book! Hazel and Augustus really bond over her favourite story and dream about meeting the author. I didn't quite expect that element and I love how it turned out.  It gave Hazel and Augustus something to enjoy and strive towards together, and that really helped them build their relationship.Isaac actually ended up being one of my favourite characters. He's Hazel and Augustus's friend and he had to get his eyes removed because of his cancer. I just wanted to hug him so many times throughout the book! He's such a sweet guy.I kind of feel like an idiot for not guessing the ending (because in hindsight I guess it's obvious), but man, that hit me like a freight train. That's when the tears came! I won't say I was drowning in tears, because I wasn't. I've cried harder over other books. But a few tears did some and I was laying in bed sniffling somewhat pathetically. I think part of me is a little disappointed that I didn't cry more (which might be weird), but oh well. Not every book can turn you into an ugly cryer.I think the one thing things I didn't love about this book were the characters. Both main characters (Hazel and Augustus) were a bit... pretentious. They're the kind of people that over analyze everything and meticulously pick apart common slang, phrases, and traditions. It was a bit funny at first, but it got a tiring after a while, and in general, I'm not crazy about people like that. I've encountered a few before and they drive me a bit nuts with their, Oh you poor, naïve mortal, you can't speak as well as I can attitude. I found myself skimming a few of the long, pretentious, let's analyze the heck out of this paragraphs.And, similarly, I never really saw Hazel and Augustus's relationship as love. Hazel and Augustus had a great, great relationship, but I mostly saw it as friendship. I didn't see a lot of sexual chemistry there. They were definitely two people of the same mind, and in that sense they fit together wonderfully, but that was kind of it. No sexual tension, no chemistry, no romance. And I would have been totally okay with that, had Hazel and Augustus not constantly called their relationship true love and an epic love story and things like that. I think I would have clicked with it better had it just been a wonderful friendship, rather than forced into a romance.I didn't completely hate the characters though. I loved how kind and selfless Augustus was. If you remove his pretentious side, he's really an amazing guy. He goes above and beyond for his friends, and that really shined throughout the book.Overall I do think that The Fault in Our Stars is a great book, and it's easy to see why so many people adore it. It's not one of my favourites, but it's certainly worth a read and I recommend that everyone give it a shot!"
2," This book is both tragic and funny.  John Green is able to blend the two into such a beautiful story of teenagers in love.  The story involves Hazel and Augustus who meet in a cancer survivor group.  The two of them are typical teenagers who are nervous around the opposite sex, text rather than talk on the phone, and think adults don't understand them.  But, they are also not typical teenagers.  Both are cancer survivors and Hazel has lungs that don't work right and force her to drag her oxygen tank with her everywhere.  Hazel is 16 and takes college courses after getting her GED.  Augustus is 19 and was once a star basketball player until he lost his leg to cancer.  The two of them speak in metaphors and quote books while making jokes about their cancer status.  You can't help but find their relationship absolutely adorable, charming, and yet, heartbreaking.As I was reading the book, I was at first surprised that it was labeled as a YA novel.  There were plenty of words used in the book that I didn't know.  Also, the theme of the book was a bit adult at times.  It is written for ages 14 and up, but I would recommend it for maybe 16 or even 17 and up.  I know that our son who will be 14 in 6 months wouldn't get this novel at this point in his life. The story is told from Hazel's perspective and her vocabulary is abnormal from most 16 year-old girls.  She is quite intelligent and well-read.Hazel won me over immediately with her witty banter and the way she was completely literal and straight forward regarding her cancer, how she felt, and what she was thinking.  Hazel said the things most of us thought and wanted to say and made me laugh numerous times. One of my favorite lines in the book is when Hazel is about to leave on a trip, she looks down her blouse and says to her lungs, Keep your sh*t together.The story of Hazel and Augustus will elicit varied emotions as you travel through the pages.  No, they aren't typical teenagers because they have already lived a life most of us will never live.  Keep that in mind as you turn the pages and struggle with their conversations.  Don't let that take away from the underlying message of the story and the relationship Hazel and Augustus have in a much too short story.  Keep a box of kleenex close by.THE FAULT IN OUR STARS is currently be made into a movie which I am super excited about.  It's tentatively scheduled for June 2014 in the US."
4," For novelist John Green, it seems as though the fourth novel is the charm. The Fault in Our Stars is the fourth book written by the author, and received by far the most positive public reaction of all of his books. The novel rose to #1 on the Amazon.com and Barnes &amp; Noble bestseller lists in June 2011. Quickly rising to the number one New York Times Best Seller, teens all over the nation became captivated by the story of Hazel Grace Lancaster, a teenager living with cancer.Warning all readers! All emotions, from laughter to tears will be provoked while reading the story of Hazel. John Green manages to portray a sorrow-filled story in a humorous and thought-provoking way.  Hazel Grace has the mind of a regular teenager; however her body is not as healthy as a typical one. Diagnosed with Stage 4 thyroid cancer at a young age of thirteen, along with tumors in her lungs, she has learned to live with treatments and the frightening life of a cancer patient. Phalanxifor, a new drug on the market, has kept her alive for four years. Now a seventeen year old, Hazel is forced to carry an oxygen tank around. Hazel is definitely not a typical teenager due to both her illness as well as her frighteningly morbid view on the world  Green keeps the readers smiling through the perspective of witty Hazel. Both her brutal honesty and realistic view on life capture the reader from page one. As Hazel introduces herself, she describes her experience at a support group for teens with cancer which is boring as hell. She explains that she Didn't want to take the elevator, because taking the elevator is a Last Days activity at Support Group. Hazel is able to depict such a morbid scene in a refreshing way that opens a door of comprehension into a world that all audiences may not otherwise understand. The true beauty of the story is when Augustus Waters, a happy-go-lucky survivor of cancer meets Hazel. A whole new kind of romance is introduced to the world of literature. Hazel and Gus immediately hit it off, and continue in a relationship of deep understanding. The book follows the plot of these two teenagers in love, and with a beautiful balance of dry humor, romance and thought-provoking perspectives on life, John Green draws the reader in, creating literature that will make a difference in lives of many young Americans.  Green portrays a romance based on support in times of tragedy. It is hard not to melt over the true affection that Gus has for Hazel. The book shows the difficulty of loving someone who does not know how much time they have on this earth. The unconditional love that these two share in times of tragedy will captivate you. I'll fight it. I'll fight it for you. Don't you worry about me, Hazel Grace. I'm okay. I'll find a way to hang around and annoy you for a long time. Not only is this romance extremely meaningful, but the fact that both teens have survived cancer for so long provides life perspectives that provoke self-reflection. As Gus so perfectly and simply says, The real heroes anyway aren't the people doing things; the real heroes are the people NOTICING things, paying attention. All readers will be forced to think about life in a larger perspective, and notice the heartbreaking truth of love in a mortal world.  To read this story is to have one's perspectives changed forever. This must-read has been called a blend of melancholy, sweet, philosophical and funny by The New York Times. It also states that the book stays the course of tragic realism. It is impossible to put this unique book down. Once you do, the loving and thoughtful story of Hazel and Gus will stick with you for quite some time. A captivating and emotional read, The Fault in Our Stars is one of the best young adult novels in the market today."
5," knew it would leave me hanging like that AIA book. Now I am like Hazel, wanting to know what happened next. If she died too like Anna in AIA. I hate you, John Green for ending it like that. &gt;:( Whatever.And as much as I really wanna hate John Green, I don't. Not really. Like the AIA book (this book is just a fictional book and doesn't really exist, it was just mentioned in TFOS book), I know that it just feel right to end like that. It's appropriate. Although it just leave me wanting to know what happened with the other character... I'm okay with the ending.The Fault in Our Stars got really high praises from almost everyone I know from Goodreads. My real life friends (those who had already read the book) says that I would love the book and will cry like they did. Well, yeah I was expecting it to be so epic. WHAT? Put yourself in my shoes and of course you'll expect something high from it.Did my expectation meets the book's praises from everyone? Well, yeah! But not that much. I mean, first part of the book, I'm waiting for the crying part. And got nothing. But that's okay. I told myself, it's just the first part, of course there's no crying yet. Middle part, still got nothing. Although I'm quite satisfied with how the story is developing.I love Augustus, love Hazel, I like them together. I like how they try to be with each other even with all the sickness they both got. So yeah... Slightly last part (maybe between the middle and last part of the book), I got a bit shocked. Because well he relapsed. I guess that it is a possibility even though they cleared you at first and still clear for a long time.Also, I don't like how Gus told his friend (forgot his name) and Hazel to make an Obituary for him. It just breaks my heart. Still does whenever I think of it, like right now. I'm a bit teary eyed remembering how and what they wrote for him in case he dies. I would never be strong enough to write about my loved ones for their funeral. I would never be strong enough to tell them to write one, in the first place.But that last part? I freakin' cried. WHY?! Why... It's just so sudden. I turn the next page, on the next chapter... HE DIED?! WHY?! JUST. LIKE. THAT. I was like. WHAT?! :((( and then I love the letter he made for the author of AIA. It was really for Hazel. How he felt for her. It's just so... heartbreaking. Because he's gone and all that. And I feel what Hazel was feeling while reading the letter.I feel like there's more to the letter when it got cut off. Yeah. It ends with the letter. But I really feel that there's still some message left. I do think it was cut because Hazel dies too. Yeah. Sad. :(I don't really like reading books where one of the main characters die. That's why I never read Nicholas Sparks books anymore. But anyway... The plot of this TFOS is really good. The characters are well created, well-thought.It shows what happens to people who have cancer. How they feel. I know it might not be what they REALLY think because they might lose hope... but this book is about learning to live while you can. Hoping that one day you'll be okay. That SOMEONE is still there to love you unconditionally. Who support you without question asks because they love you so much. It's not just about the person who got cancer. It's also about the people around them. Their loved ones trying to cope, it might always be rough... but again... Don't lose hope. I know it is hard. SO hard and SO EASY to just give it all up. But if you could still can... DON'T.I might be interpreting the book wrong... but that's how I felt after reading it. So that's just my opinion and you are entitled to yours too. :)"
5," My friends told me I had to read this book.  That it was one of the best they'd ever read, that I'd fall in love with the characters, that it'd leave me feeling broken and sad, but that I'd love it just the same.  And so, I put it off for quite some time because I don't really enjoy being sad.  I also don't like to physically borrow books from the library because they aren't mine, and the ebook of this one was just too much money, in my opinion (at no point do I think ebook prices should be comparable to the paperback price).  But then there was a sale and the ebook was only $3.99 on Amazon, so I scooped it up and, one Friday evening not too long ago, started reading it.Initially, it didn't pull me in.  I wasn't in love with the characters, the plot was like so many I've read before, and I just didn't see what everyone was talking about (and I do mean everyone).  Hazel didn't tug on my heart strings--in fact, she was presented in a way that made me dislike her.  Catty and unforgiving, she jerks her parents around and has all but given up, even though she has a second chance at life.  I couldn't understand her.  Augustus was interesting, but he seemed unreal, almost forced to me, and I sighed and thought this was going to be one of those instances where I just didn't feel the same as the whole world around me.And then, at some point while I was reading (and I honestly can't pinpoint it), I became irrevocably attached to the characters.  Augustus seems to bring out the best in everyone around him, and Hazel's snark stopped getting on my nerves and I began to love her, and all those around her.  They jumped off the page and became real.  And then, as John Green has a tendency to do, he ripped out my heart and left me blubbering for hours into the night, blowing my nose, soaking my shirt in tears, hiccupping for breath.  The Fault in Our Stars is just that touching, and it truly left me breathless.  And while I didn't fall in love with the story right away, I definitely did fall in love with it.  My friends were right, as they usually are.  This is an amazing novel and I highly suggest you read it if you haven't.  I just hope the movie rendition does it justice, because this is a very powerful piece."
4,"...just...all the feelings.When I first heard about this book I was so excited for it, it sounded like an excellent story and I couldn't wait to get my pre-order in the mail. Then I started reading reviews and seeing people rave over the book on twitter and I got anxious. See, a lot of times when a book has crazy hype and everyone loves it, I end up not really caring for the book. I don't like not liking everyone's favorite thing, but it's just usually how it works. John Green has such a passionate and devoted following and I didn't want to let anyone down by not liking the book. So when I got it in the mail, I promptly put it on my shelf and went about reading every other book first. Then one night I was feeling brave and decided I was finally going to give it a go. I should also tell you that I am actually a ghost while writing this, because I am dead. This book absolutely killed me, but the good kind of killed (there is a good kind, I swear).I don't even know if I can really review this book, because every time I think about it all that comes to mind is WOW, what, what what?, *sob*, *swoon*, etc. I fully expected a book about a girl with cancer to make me feel things, because that is what stories about dying people do, but I never expected the level of emotion that this story evoked. And not just sad emotions, there was plenty of humor, happiness, and anger thrown into the mix. I'm pretty sure Augustus Waters is one of my favorite people (real or fictional) of all time. That boy is just so cool. Also, sweet and completely adorable. For a while I wished that the book was written from his point of view, but ultimately I really liked seeing him through Hazel's eyes. The best scenes were when the two of them were together, alone or with other people, bantering back and forth. I loved their personalities when they got together and they both had a wicked sense of humor.After finishing the last couple of pages, I reread them, then just stared at the book for a little while. I was so completely blown away and so grateful that I finally took the chance on this amazing story. This is definitely one for the reread pile and now I have the extremely hard task of choosing which John Green book to follow this one up with. I have this sneaking suspicion that no other character is going to live up to Augustus, but I guess that's alright by me"
5," avoided this book like the plague because the subject matter seemed way too heavy.  Don’t get me wrong, I love a novel filled with angst and sorrow but this would be too much for even me to handle.  I had been told by fellow readers that it’s a book that MUST be read.  With a heavy heart I decided to find some courage and tackle this book with an open mind.“As he read, I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once.”The Fault in Our Stars in an incredibly well written and thought out book, filled with memorable characters and a heartbreaking plot.  There’s even a twist that I did not see coming and I welcomed it with open arms.  Mind you, I think I needed therapy and some Xanax by the time I was done but it was definitely engaging.  The first few chapters did seem a little slow for me but it wasn’t a bad thing, I believe the author was setting up the foundation of a profound story of love and loss.“Sometimes, you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book.”This is the story of a two teenagers battling cancer.  Not only do they become friends but they ultimately fall in love and the journey they embark on is one that will move you to tears.  As I read this book I felt like I was running out of time because I wanted them to experience a life without cancer, without the worry of the doom and gloom that was constantly nipping at their heels.“What a slut time is. She screws everybody.”The writing is absolutely stellar and incredibly clever.  The dialogue between Hazel and Augustus was filled with wit, sarcasm and amazing insight on life.  I really don’t have the words to describe what this book did to me.  Could I re-read it?  Probably not because it’s way too heavy but I highlighted a number of quotes that I don’t want to forget.  Yes, the writing is that good.“You realize that trying to keep your distance from me will not lessen my affection for you. All efforts to save me from you will fail.”I don’t know much about John Green but I’ve become one of his many fans and I will definitely be reading more books by this talented author.  He’s written a truthful story about what’s it’s like to have a terminal illness and how it impacts those around you.  While this is a tough book to read for many different reasons, it’s a story that must be read and one you won’t regret."
5," There is always that one book you want to read, but leave it at the end of your TBR for many reasons. Whether it be that everybody and the mother is telling me I have to read it, or it's a book that just happens gather enough followers that it ends up showing up on every blog that you check. Hyped books can go one of two ways, you can either kick yourself for putting it off for so long, or it would somehow feel like a let down.We meet Hazel Grace, a sixteen-year-old with terminal thyroid cancer. Her mother thinks she's having an episode with depression, so her doctors suggest going to group therapy. This is where we meet the charismatic Augustus Waters. We take a trip into this phenomenal book and jump into the lives of Hazel and Augustus. It's amazing how these set of characters know nothing in life is ever set in stone, yet we get to live right along with them.I've put off reading TFiOS for over a year but not because I didn't want to read it, but because I just never really felt like I was in the mood to read it. In my mind, TFiOS was one of those books that you had to be somewhat depressed to read it. Honestly all I heard when somebody pitched it to me was,You are going to bawl your eyes out! It's so sad, but I loved it! You can see why I put it off for so long. If you find yourself having the same thoughts as me, I can say you can cross them out without any worries. I found myself laughing so much more than I originally thought. I kept waiting to be hit by something else, but all I felt was absolute joy! Yes, there is heart wrenching moments, they essentially capture the essence of the entire book. Without them TFiOS wouldn't be complete. Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters will be characters I treasure forever.BLog: [...]"
4," pretty much knew that this would be a somewhat sad read going into it, but based on the glowing reviews, I decided to join the masses who enjoyed The Fault in Our Stars so much.  The audio version is read by Kate Rudd, who did a fantastic job.The story is narrated by 16 year-old, Hazel Grace Lancaster, who was diagnosed with stage IV, thyroid cancer at the age of 13. She's survived cancer thus far (3 years), but she has had to endure experimental drugs, and now carries a portable oxygen tank with her everywhere she goes.Depressed (who wouldn't be?) and taken out of her regular school during her treatments, she is encouraged to try a support group for cancer kids.  It is there that she meets, the handsome 17 year-old Augustus Waters, and the two engage in various philosophical debates, and one thing leads to another -- before long becoming more than just friends. Hazel is obsessed with a book about cancer called, An Imperial Affliction and she encourages Augustus (Gus) to read it, so she can get his opinion on the ambiguous ending.Without giving away too much about this novel,  I'll just say that this book is very much about being a teen and dealing with cancer, in addition to dealing with the other challenges healthy teens face.  It's about making the most out of the circumstances you've been forced to deal with.  It's about love, life and death, and the delivery is just so well done.The story is full of beautiful passages. I ended up highlighting  these in my eBook edition after hearing some of them on audio.........................The marks humans leave are too often scars.There will come a time when all of us are dead. All of us. There will come a time when there are no human beings remaining to remember that anyone ever existed or that our species ever did anything. There will be no one left to remember Aristotle or Cleopatra, let alone you. Everything that we did and built and wrote and thought and discovered will be forgotten and all of this will have been for naught. Maybe that time is coming soon and maybe it is millions of years away, but even if we survive the collapse of our sun, we will not survive forever. There was time before organisms experienced consciousness, and there will be time after. And if the inevitability of human oblivion worries you, I encourage you to ignore it. God knows that's what everyone else does. Sometimes, you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book.There are infinite numbers between 0 and 1. There's .1 and .12 and .112 and an infinite collection of others. Of course, there is a bigger infinite set of numbers between 0 and 2, or between 0 and a million. Some infinities are bigger than other infinities. A writer we used to like taught us that. There are days, many of them, when I resent the size of my unbounded set. I want more numbers than I'm likely to get, and God, I want more numbers for Augustus Waters than he got. But, Gus, my love, I cannot tell you how thankful I am for our little infinity. I wouldn't trade it for the world. You gave me a forever within the numbered days, and I'm grateful.Almost everyone is obsessed with leaving a mark upon the world. Bequeathing a legacy. Outlasting death. We all want to be remembered. I do, too. That's what bothers me most, is being anotherunremembered casualty in the ancient and inglorious war against disease.So, I guess we are who we are for a lot of reasons. And maybe we'll never know most of them. But even if we don't have the power to choose where we come from, we can still choose where we go from there. We can still do things. And we can try to feel okay about them.The Fault in Our Stars is a story that you'll think about for a long while. It's such a touching story, one that reminds us once again, that --- life, indeed, is hard and often unfair.  I enjoyed this book a lot and can't wait to see the movie in 2014."
5," Where to start? Perhaps by the fact I thought I would hate this book with all my guts... It contains all the patterns of a book I would usually hate: cancer kids, struggling through life (which means the author kind of used this cheap escape route so he would get people to like the book, out of pity or such). I thought from the start one of the characters HAD to die (which is terrible in a book, because you're giving away one of the turning-points even before the reader finished the first chapter), unrealistic characters (it is very hard to find a teenager, let alone a bunch of them, with such an insightful perspective of life, though I could admit, may be one of the side-effects of dying) and I assumed I would find a desperate cry of hope of a life that clearly does not give a crap.However I found myself quite surprised as I went through the book and slowly started to appreciate the effort of the author. Although his writing would certainly appeal most female teenagers, as well as the physical description of the main male character, I could see the deepness of each of them as they developed. I found that the author was treating the subjects of death and how people deal with cancer with a sarcasm I didn't think I would find. As if he was making fun of his own work. He is surely then, aware of how people deal with sicknesses and this type of books. How people deal with that kind of pity that isn't really there because sickness isn't happening to them.So, I understood that it takes a lot of effort to write about such sickness with such insight. I thought it was easy to just spread that kind of shame around without much need of concentration. But this is a hard topic, it's hard to read about it, and it's hard to analyse it, let alone write about it.If you're worried about the cheesiness and perhaps what I mentioned above, don't. I could see how some people might get annoyed with it, however I'm asking you to give this book a chance. Leave aside the most apparent things in the book and look for the deep things in it. Maybe most people will only see the most unessential parts of it, don't be one of them. These flaws are present in the most superficial way possible, but the thoughts and the point of views, the experiences and the conclusions the characters reach, are up to you level of understanding what this book means. It makes you think. It makes you understands certain things, it makes you fall in love with the characters, it raises awareness and it's definitely thought-provoking.It leaves you with a tight knot tied up your throat, and to that I tell you, only the best books can give you that feeling."
5," Everyone knows what this one's about since I was too chicken to bring myself to read it for months. It's about Hazel who is living with stage 4 thyroid cancer, is on oxygen and is just trying to live her life like anyone else  She meets Augustus at a cancer support group her mother forces her into attending. He is in remission from the cancer that claimed his limb and is attending group to support his buddy Isaac . Augustus is charming and beautiful and he invites Hazel to hang out with him. She does the smart thing and agrees. They have a lot in common besides cancer and begin a doomed but beautiful romance. But the book, of course, is so much more than a young adult romance.I'm giving this one a 4 and 1/2 because I felt that some of the conversations didn't feel real. They seemed super thought out and I could feel the author putting these words in their mouths and it pulled me out of their world here and there. I know several brilliant teens and they do not speak this way. And no they are not dying from cancer (thank God) but I don't believe that would change their essential way of relating to one another. They may write this way on Tumbler but their exchanges in real life are never as lyrical and thoughtful and insightful as those between Augustus and Hazel Grace. That's my only complaint and it's really a minor one. This book is as heartbreaking as all of the reviews promise. How could it not be? It's a book about kids living with cancer AND their parents are present (what a novelty in YA) adding another level of heartache to so many scenes. I knew it couldn't possibly end leaving me all warm and fuzzy because it is not that kind of book but it's also funny and smart with some gorgeous prose. I'm glad I finally broke down and listened to it but I'm never going to do it again. My heart couldn't take it.Narration Notes: Kate Rudd narrates all of the characters in this novel. Her voice is youthful and full life and she does a wonderful job with Hazel as well Gus and their parents. . The only fail for me was her narration of Hazel's friend Candace who puts on a false British accident (in the book) that the narrator didn't translate very well. Candace just sounded like a dotty, snotty old biddy. Fortunately Candace has such a miniscule role in the book that it's hardly worth mentioning and real nitpickery. But that's what I do."
2," Oh yes, leave it to me to be one of those left behind who haven't read The Fault in Our Stars. I'm sorry. In my defense, I am not keen over reading realistic fiction. I feel like I've already had my fair share of reality that books should be otherwise more ethereal. But there are also times that I need a break from the fantasy world and so, here came the opportunity to read something different...I'm going to keep this short since I'm sure a lot of you have gone through the tons of reviews that this book has received.I was surprised about the normalcy I found in Hazel. For someone who was diagnosed with Stage IV thyroid cancer, she comes out as just any typical teenager (except for the oxygen tank and all, of course). She's witty and spunky. Cleary, not what I expected. Some would imagine that people with cancer or any form of life-threatening diseases are likely to be sad and depressed, but Augustus and Hazel show otherwise. And I'm glad about that.It was a big mistake to read this book in public. You see, my fiancé's younger sister had a fashion show, which we promised to watch, the day I was halfway through with the reading The Fault in Our Stars. Being so engrossed in the story, I couldn't put it down. So while waiting for the show to start, I decided to read through. When I reached the heart wrenching scenes of Augustus, boy was I in an embarrassing state. I kept stopping and tearing my eyes off the book every few paragraphs just so I could keep the tears at bay. My fiancé just kept smirking and shaking his head every time he looked at me (the dude got so used to me crying over a book that he finds it normal... wow! Thanks a lot.)The Fault in Our Stars is the very first John Green book that I have ever read. And I'm happy to say that I am definitely reading his other books after this one! It's no question why The Fault in Our Stars has captured the hearts of so many readers. The story may be simple but a very thoughtful one at that. [SPOILER AHEAD!] How ironic is it that the John Green ended the book the way Van Houten, the author of AIA (can't say what that is since it's a key element in the story), ended his own book in the story?"
4," often saw this book being read around campus at the time I decided to give it a try. I figured, I should see for myself if it's worthy of the hype. And now I can say, indeed it is.The Fault in Our Stars is the first John Green book I've read so I had no idea how he writes. The story was different for me than the other books I've read with the same underlying theme - inevitable death. First, I liked Hazel's pragmatic view of life. She didn't want cancer to be her life but rather just a side effect of living. She tried to live normally as possible even if she needed to carry a small oxygen tank around in a cart because her lungs weren't strong enough to breathe on their own. I liked that aspect of the book because it's not, as the characters would call those types of books, a cancer book. Secondly, I liked Augustus Waters a lot. He's one very likable character overall. He's light and witty - his personality fits very well with Hazel's. I enjoyed reading the book because their friendship just seemed so natural and it progressed beautifully for me. It's not so much as them trying to find consolation with each other because they're both cancer kids; it's them enjoying each other's company because they have the same perception of how they should live their life.The only factor that caused me to rate this book a 4 out of 5 was the rather unrealistic way in which Hazel and, most importantly, Augustus articulated their thoughs. No teenager talks that way! It's not like I didn't enjoy it - I did on some level. Because I have a soft spot for guys who can speak the way Gus did (dorks are the bomb). But at the back of my mind I always felt like all their dialogues, if set in a different scenario, would otherwise sound too unrealistic. I know it's a work of fiction but I also want a way for me to be able to connect to the characters all throughout.  I mean I loved the characters but at some point in the story, their dialogues were too much.Having said that, I'd still encourage you to read this book. John Green was able to draw my emotions in. Even if I didn't always enjoy the way the characters spoke, I still felt like their story's real.  The way they casually talked about death and afterlife with such acceptance and normality was heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time. I laughed with them. I cried with them. Overall, it's an experience that you just have to go for."
4," This book seriously ripped my heart out of my chest and although I'm happy I finally read it to see what the hype was all about, there's no way I could knowingly put myself through that kind of heartache again over a book!John Green is an amazing writing and The Fault in Our Stars is proof of that. He wrote about cancer like he was an actual doctor and after I read that he lived in Germany for a couple years and researched/corresponded with numerous doctors on the subject (to the point where even his made-up medicine was entirely believable and I wouldn't be surprised if people who got cancer actually asked their doctors about this drug, only to be told it doesn't exist), I had to wonder if writing this book was as cathartic of an experience for him as it was for those who read it.Hazel and Augustus (Gus) are lovable, witty, thoughtful and sweet with one another in a way that isn't overly romantic.I'm in love with you and I'm not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things. I'm in love with you, and I know that love is jut a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable and that we're all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, and I am in love with you.There were parts I was laughing, but mostly they were endearing and provoked a guarded smile out of me, because they came sandwiched between knot-in-throat inducing moments.I think forever is an incorrect concept, I answered.He smirked. You're an incorrect concept.I know. That's why I'm being taken out of the rotation.There was A LOT of parts that cut me straight to the bone and caused tears to fall out of my eyes. They couldn't be bothered with the slow descent down my face and went with the all-too-metaphorical free fall approach instead...'You know how I know you're a fighter? You called a ten a nine.But that wasn't quite right. I called it a nine because I was saving my ten. And here it was, the great and terrible ten, slamming me again and again as I lay still and alone in my bed staring at the ceiling, the waves tossing me against the rocks then pulling me back out to sea so they could launch me again into the jagged face of the cliff, leaving me floating faceup on the water, undrowned.'This book is so philisophical, I could have imagined it being on the syllabus in college, bringing out class-length discussions on The Imperial Affliction alone, the book Hazel and Gus idolize in Fault, which is really just the adult writer in John Green contrasting with the younger, but still deeply-philisophical viewpoints of Hazel and Gus.There is religious ambiguity in Fault. At first, I truly thought all the views on death were atheist, but I discovered there is double meaning in a lot of what John Green writes and he constructs his sentences purposefully and carefully for the reader to determine their own meaning at times. Other times, it is the admitted unknown of what happens next:I believe the universe wants to be noticed. I think the universe is improbably biased toward consciousness, that it rewards intelligence in part because the universe enjoys its elegance being observed. And who am I, living in the middle of history, to tell the universe that it - or my observation of it - is temporary?More importantly, The Fault in Our Stars is about being remembered and leaving a mark. Why are some remembered, while others are so easily forgotten after they die?The book was turned to the page with Anne Frank's name, but what got me about it was the fact that right beneath her name there were four Aron Franks. Four. Four Aron Franks without museums, without historical markers, without anyone to mourn them.Everything about this book was bittersweet. Hazel's brave reverence in the face of impending death, however vaguely ominous it may be, was so powerful that I thought, 'So this is how I would feel if I was going to die tomorrow?''I would probably never agin see the ocean from thirty thousand feet above, so far up that you can't make out the waves or any boats, so that the ocean is a great and endless monolith. I could imagine. I could remember it. But I couldn't see it again, and it occurred to me that the voracious ambition of humans is never sated by dreams coming true, because there is always the thought that everything might be done better and again.'The Fault in Our Stars was excellently written. Having to see what all the 'fuss' was about, I bought the book and allowed it to collect dust on my shelf for six months before I gathered the courage to dive into it, knowing it would probably break my heart, which it did.You don't have to like the book to admit that John Green is severely gifted at what he does, and it would be smart of you to read this cautiously. It's ridiculous to allow yourself the comforting state of denial you'll inevitably cling to as you read chapter after chapter, ignorantly assuming there's no way he'll go there, because he can and does. He knows where to hit you where it hurts. I kinda hate him for it, but can't help but admit that The Fault in Our Stars left it's mark on me, that's for sure."
4," John Green established himself as a vlogger, thus he has garnered experience with criticism. He was blunt when he said this had nothing to do with anything that has happened to him and this brutal honesty flows onto the pages through Hazel Grace Lancaster and throughout the novel.Hazel is a cancer patient to the point that the cancer has spread to her lungs and requires her to wear oxygen. What starts as a drag in having to attend a support group turns into a connection with the guy who becomes the love of her life: Augustus Waters. Augustus is in remission, but the disease left him with a prosthetic leg. Their condition does not hold either of them down from using the leftover wish Augustus had to visit Amsterdam in order to convince Peter van Houten, the author of Hazel's favorite book, to tell them what happens to the characters in the novel. While van Houten does not turn out to be what he seems, the connection between Hazel and Augustus becomes very lovable for this generation.The reason this novel can be classified as perfect is because it does a perfect job capturing the attention of its age group, which I would say would most likely be 16-25. Aside from that, the characters are just so real. I am not just referring to Hazel and Augustus, but also their parents (Hazel's over-emotional and Augustus' witty) and Isaac, a blind friend of Augustus that comes off as being a cheeky foil.This novel grabbed me to the point that I finished the last 150 pages in three hours and this is following high endorsements from just about everybody within the English department that told me and every other reader they had to grab this. Their positive emotions are well intended, so pick this up!"
4," had heard how great John Green's The Fault in Our Stars was since it initially hit bookstore shelves. I had a stack of books to be read that was ridiculously tall so I kept pushing aside the idea of reading this book. Until a digital edition became available through our library.I don't think at the time of checking it out I knew yet that it was young adult fiction, and I don't think I would have cared had I known. A good book is a good book. And I wasn't disappointed.The story of Hazel Grace Lancaster, Augustus Waters, and their friend, Isaac, is brilliantly drawn. Creating sensitive young souls caring strongly for one another is not always easy. John Green has done a masterful job of creating his characters as well as the backdrop for what turns into an amazing love story.Hazel and Augustus meet at a youth support group for cancer patients. The attraction is instantaneous. Smart enough to understand that cancer always looms over its victims, in remission or not, Hazel and Augustus, with the help of Isaac, strive to make the most of every moment.Their conversations and dialogue seem overly mature for their chronological ages, but then confronting your immortality likely matures you faster. None of this detracts from the greatness of Green's writing. His use of language, scene, characterizations, and interaction between his characters is exquisite.The Fault in Our Stars simultaneously made me laugh, cry, giggle, angry, sad, and overwhelmed by how much feeling Hazel and Augustus put into coping with their illnesses while loving each other immensely. Truly a love story I never expected in a YA novel. Kudos to John Green for showing us how to love one another."
5," originally posted here:[...]All. The. Feels&lt;blockquote&gt;“It would be a privilege to have my heart broken by you.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;Much has been said about The Fault in Our Stars, being John Green’s most popular book, and I say listen to every person that says how good it is, and that they may be tears. I first read this book way back in 2012 not knowing what I was getting. And I would like to quote the upcoming movie tagline that this is one sick love story. Out of all of John Green’s books, this is the most romantic one, but this is also the most heart-wrenching. I was certainly unprepared for the pain of this poignant tale.&lt;blockquote&gt;“I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;This is one of the books that gave me one of the worst hangovers leaving me undone yet moved. I shall now start to use the word “love” a lot. I love love love Hazel Grace and Augustus, and I ship them hard. I usually want the guy for myself, but Hazel and Gus deserve each other. I love how they brought up that they shouldn’t be defined by their illnesses. I love how they are such imperfect characters, yet managed to be perfect in this story and even called each other beautiful. I love their relationship with their family and their friend, Isaac. I love how Gus calls her Hazel Grace that makes it so endearing, and Hazel calls him Augustus. I love it all, and I’m not sorry. I love how intelligent and witty the writing and the characters are. I adore how this book can make one laugh, think, cry, and love, and how it stays with me to the point of almost quoting the book when thinking about love and life. This is truly a masterpiece that deserves to be read and read again and again and again."
5," This heart-filled novel discusses the everyday struggle of a young teen living with cancer and trying to fit into the real world. This book has opened my eyes as to how grateful I should be about the life I have. John Green was influenced to write this novel because one of his closest friends was diagnosed with cancer. John Green, who is one of my favorite authors, tells this story by making the reader feel as they themselves were going through what Hazel the main character was going through. This romantic fiction book shows that even though a person has cancer they can have a beautiful love story also. This book is one of those books that can be read over and over again and will never get old.Hazel Grace was not like the average teenager. Things suddenly changed for her when she met Augustus Walters and she then started to feel alive again. Hazel thought of herself as a grenade and she did not want to get to close to anyone or else she would blow up (die) and leave them to suffer. Hazel meets the boy of her dreams to only have to push him away for his own good.  The overall meaning is to enjoy the life you have. Life is short and you should spend it being happy and that is what Hazel realized.  I noticed throughout the novel as I got more in depth I grew to love Hazel more and more as a person. She seemed so nice and deserved the world but instead she had to live each day struggling to catch her breath. Towards the end of the book John Green throws something unexpected which changed everything. When I was reading the novel I could not believe what was occurring. I would highly recommend this book to anyone it is too good to even put into words. It is no shocker that this book has now been created into a film."
5," think this book was too built up in my expectations. It was readable and nice and short but I wouldn't have been too bothered if I lost it halfway through. It's just a teenage love story. Nothing particularly exciting, profound or surprising here."
5, read this because it is highly recommended for teens and my daughter was also reading it. It is interesting and has a good story but the concepts are probably not appropriate for anyone under 13 or 14 unless they are a pretty sophisticated reader.
5," This is a book I won't read twice... It was incredible, well-written, touching, poignant, and I could go on forever.  But I felt like my heart was being ripped from my chest with almost every page.  It was terribly, tragically, powerfully beautiful."
2," The story of Hazel &amp; Augustus, teenaged cancer survivors, whose wisdom and sarcasm make then two of my favorite characters ever. I lovely story about good and clever people dealing with the worst and the best that life can dish with grace and humor."
5," My girlfriend really wanted this book and it was 20 bucks in the bookstore, so I looked on here and the hardcover was half off. I got it for a great price brand new, shipped very quick and in good packaging and its perfect. She is happy, I am happy."
5," Wonderful writing, thought-provoking concepts, unique perspective. I loved the characters, the dialogue, the philosophical discussion within the book`s content. I finished this book in under 36 hours, the fastest I have read a book in quite a while."
5,t was a rough journey. But I was happy to make it with these two exceptional people. I cried till I bled but it was well worth it... Will I read it again? Maybe if I can ever get my heart back into my chest just to have it ripped out again. haha &lt;3
5," Honestly, I am not a sucker for love stories and chick-flicks or romance novels, but I would recommend this book to anyone looking for an outstanding book to sit and read for hours.John Green creates a beautiful love story in his novel, The Fault in Our Stars, which we readers can connect to our own lives. Many of the same issues that appear in the book are seen in teens’ love lives, minus the cancer that plagues both of the main characters, Hazel and Gus. The book had me hooked from the first minute, and I did not even watch the movie prior to reading this book.The love story in the novel lies between Hazel and Gus, and the lovers resemble teen relationships today; being there for each other when in need, watching movies together, traveling together, but both have cancer, and met at a cancer support group. The relationship between these two emphasizes the power of love and its ups and downs. In addition, the novel opens people’s eyes, or at least mine, about the harsh realities of cancer. On page 57, Gus states, “‘Pain demands to be felt,’” which can directly tie to his pain from cancer or pains other people suffer from the reality of their loved ones’ battles. I already knew much about these realities, for many people close to me have fought the gruesome battle, and my grandfather, also known as Papa, lost his battle last Christmas. My mom was always there for him and she was always beyond stressed out, and losing Papa was excruciatingly devastating for my whole family. After reading this, I connected the book’s sorrow to my family’s sorrow. Cancer has a way of taking its victims, but people should always remember their loved ones and cherish the moments shared. Definitely a must-read novel."
5," This was a book world that I found myself immersed into immediately. The voice in which Hazel tells the story felt extremely real to me. She was in some ways wise beyond her years, and yet she was completely adolescent, as she should be in others. Hazel is a sixteen-year-old girl who is miraculously still alive; she was diagnosed with stage IV thyroid cancer when she was thirteen. This isn’t to say that Hazel is cured of the disease, within the first chapter you are able to see the constant battle that she is in. I was completely invested in her story.She attends a cancer support group, and that is where she meets Augustus Walters. I absolutely loved the dynamic between Hazel and Augustus from their first meeting. I loved that their characters were just not one or two-dimensional, and either was the story. There were many moments in The Fault in our Stars where I found myself laughing out loud, rolling my eyes in agitation with Van Houten, or crying over what the characters have to endure.***“People will say it's sad that she leaves a lesser scar, that fewer remember her, that she was loved deeply but not widely. But it's not sad, Van Houten. It's triumphant. It's heroic. Isn't that the real heroism? Like the doctors say: First, do no harm.”***Much of the young adult genre is filled with novels about young girls, fashion, boy-drama and can easily be construed as being shallow. This isn’t to say that there isn’t a place for lighter reads such as this in the young adult genre, but for me it is books like The Fault in Our Stars that motivates me to continue reading books in this genre. This was my first book by John Green, and I am definitely intrigued to read more."
5, This is such a tear jerker but one of the best books I have read in years - I would suggest all to read this before watching the movie and is a good book for teenagers- to great grandma's- Would love to find more books like this- So worth the money
5," know that one of the reviews said that the teenagers depicted in this novel were unbelievable. I get what he is saying, but I still really enjoyed this book! The book is thought provoking, tragic and truly humorous in parts. It is worth the read."
5, am still emotional as I just finished the book. This story is so well written. I am just speechless. I was in love with the characters from page one. What a perfect blend of comedy in tragedy.  I don't know if any other book will live up to this.
5," could write all day about how marvelous I found this book, but I'll just let everyone else do that. I want to say that although a sad note is put on this book for the first few pages, this will make you feel all of the things. I know I felt them."
2," wasn't sure what to expect when I picked up this book.  By the end I felt I had taken a journey with the characters and gained something positive from the experience.  This novel made me laugh, cringe, and cry... I could not ask more from a book."
5,"t is funny and sad and tragic and, dare I say it? Hopeful. Hopeful for those left behind.  Seriously well written.  Loved all the characters - they were so real.  As a parent, this got to me on many levels. Just read it...you will be glad you did."
5," The Fault in Our Stars was one of the best books I've ever read. John Green's characters are great. Reading the book brought me surprises and feelings I didn't know a book could bring. I totally recommend it, specially if you like John Green. DFTBA"
5," This is a big ugly cry book.  I think this book has been around long enough that you know what is going to happen, at least you think you do.  It is a book about teens who have cancer, not a big leap to guess someone is going to die and it is going to be sad.  Okay you can prepare yourself for that right, wrong.Hazel grace has been terminal since she was 13.  She knows she has cancer and she knows she is not going to survive it, the only question she really has is how long can she fight it.  Her parents want her to get out, fearing she is falling into depression so they force her to go to a teen cancer support group.  The only thing that really changes about this group is the flux of people, the sad thing is you usually only quit coming when you die.The last thing Hazel expects to find in this group is a reason to look forward to the day.  Until one day Augustus shows up at the group to support a fellow friend.  Hazel is attracted to Gus immediately but what she never expected was the connection they share.  Gus lost his leg to bone cancer but she is a survivor, something Hazel will not be able to do with her cancer.  All Hazel wants to do is minimize the pain and sorrow she causes when she dies.  So she informs Gus that they can only be friends.  Gus's response, OKAY!Gus knows he will fall for Hazel and doesn't care, he is an amazing guy.  I really cannot say enough about these characters and I don't want to give too much away in case you are one of the very few people who have not read this book.  All I will tell you is that you must read it.  Yes it is sad, and tragic, but it is also beautiful and it will touch your soul.  I will never forget these character's story."
5," Couldn't put it down. Read the whole thing in one day. I laughed, I cried. I love that Hazel isn't all poor me. She's tenacious and sarcastic and wonderful. Now I don't think I want to see the movie because I feel like it could taint it somehow."
5," This book made me laugh and cry and everything in between. At first, I didn't really like the characters and they seemed far-fetched, but then it became this  beautiful love story that just seemed so real. Great book, that always left me thinking."
5," was required to read this book for school, and the emotions you have while reading it are so strong. The amount of thought and work in this book has not gone unnoticed. This book is really great.I just wish it wasn't so depressing xD"
5, This book is a must read!!! It made me laugh and cry all at the same time.......John Green put everything in such a good way that it blew my mind &lt;3. You will NOT be disappointed in buying and reading this book.Its definitely not a waste of money.
5," read it in a day....couldn't put it away. Cried most of the time.A beautiful lovestory. Humor, philososphy, lots of love and loving and cruel reality.How do you cope with dying? Will you leave your mark or will you leave scars?"
5," read this book in one day, definitely could not put it down.  It was beautifully written, and touched my heart.  It has lingered in me since I closed its covers. I have re-read the last few pages several times, to absorb the beauty of this book."
2," read this for our book club. It is a well written interesting perspective of a 16 year old cancer patient. Thought provoking and gut wrenching. Laughed and cried. Brought up good conversations and lots of questions about life, death and illness."
5," The Fault in Our Stars, by author John Green, is a truly magnificent work of art and a redeeming effect of modern literature. While I am not ordinarily a fan of the Young Adult Fiction genre, this novel has found its place among my list of favourite books all-time. It tells the story of two young people both suffering from their own flavours of cancer and their journey in finding, loving, and subsequently losing each other. I laughed, I cried, I longed to punch lead male protagonist Augustus Waters square in the jaw on account of his pretension. (I don't care how smooth, romantic, or attractive he is claimed to be- were Gus real, he would not last five minutes in a room with me without suffering a fantastic black eye. Does the word sesquipedalian remind you of anyone?) I fell easily in love with the characters- who were young and human despite their profound wisdom- and cursed into the wind once finished, hoping my cries would reach this novel's sadistic author in the state of Indiana where he resides. Reading this book is an extremely masochistic activity which I would advise to no one without prescribing first a plethora of tissues and a pillow or two to bury one's face in.All jesting aside, The Fault in Our Stars has had a great- and I'll dare presume lasting- effect on me and my now-feeble mind. The way Hazel, Augustus, and Isaac viewed their world has changed the way I view my own, and, despite the fact that my heart has been ripped clean from my mortal chest, I am glad that I took the time (the time being, of course, one very long Monday night due to the fact I couldn't put the damn blue devil down) to read it.Here's to you, John Green.Here's to you."
5,"ve read a few other reviews, and I've found that there is a wide difference of opinion amongst readers.  I'm leaving a review, if for no other reason than the fact that I seem to be the only one who had never heard of John Green before picking up this novel.  The people who didn't care for this seem to be pitting it against his other works.  This is something that doesn't apply to me and my experience with this story.I think the characters were terribly endearing, and also really realistic.  Not every teenager thinks and speaks the way that they do, but there are a fair number who do.  And, in my experience, kids with cancer or other such illnesses are much more mature than their peers, simply because they are dealing with things that no kid should even have to know about, and they don't get the opportunity to experience that sense of carefree invincibility that most of us do as children.  I don't know how anyone can read this and not fall in love with the main characters in this book.What really made me a fan of this book was that it was such a fast read, and I rarely put it down.  It isn't like there are cliffhangers at every turn; that would be a case of I couldn't put it down.  In reality, I just didn't want to.  And, it completely changed the way I look at people with terminal illness.  It isn't like I had previously thought badly of them or anything, I just really hadn't been inside their heads.  I don't know where the author gets his knowledge of such things, but it seemed very genuine.When all is said and done, this is a very sad book, which seems weird since I spent lots of time smiling and laughing throughout.  I highly recommend this to everyone!"
5, love this book it's so sad but sweet and I love it! It made me cry! It's so good though. It's a book well written and it's awesome and romantic and some of the scenes were a little iffy for me but that's ok because it just made the book better.
5," gave this book 5 stars because, well, to be frank, it is quite incredible. It is well written and makes you fall in love with the characters. I cannot express, truly, how much I loved and enjoyed this book. Grab your tissues and get to reading!"
5," That word ^^ is one that will be etched onto your heart forever, after you read this book. You'll see why, I promise. This book was so emotionally deep, and so real. It left me in tears, and I can proudly say, I am in love with Augustus Waters (:"
5," haven't smiled so wide or been moved to tears from a book in a long time. The characters, Hazel and Augustus matter. And their love story is quirky and wonderful. I am sad it was all over so soon...I could have  kept on reading for much longer."
5," The main characters in this book are teenagers who are living with cancer. I was hesitant to read it at first because I thought it might be too depressing, but not at all. This book is so well written and I was so eager to read through the pages."
5,ll keep this short and sweet. This was the first book I ever finished in 1 day because I simply couldn't put it down. It made me both laugh my ass off at parts and bawl my eyes out at others. Super emotional. Super awesome. Just read it people.
5," Also reviewed on my blog! http://sassyanddangerous.blogspot.mx/Please do remember that this is MY PERSONAL opinion. If you can not handle a semi harsh opinion, then feel free to close this out. Also, originally, I gave this book no stars, but with Amazon, I have to give it a star.At first, I thought, damn, what is all the hype about this book? Maybe I should read it too. Worst. Idea. Ever. The writing was so freaking cheesy I thought I’d cry, the romance was too fast paced, and the way the author portrayed his characters made me cringe and want to bash my head into the wall.My opinion on the writing;The writing was very dull, cheesy, and just didn't intrigue me at all. It was predictable, and it was slow and dull. It was like reading Twilight all over again, but instead of reading about an attention biatch and her freaky vampire boyfriend, I was reading about Bella's boring twin sister and a one legged pirate. I could go on and on..My opinion on the characters;Hazel: To me, I found her very, very dull. The way she interacted with her family, with Augustus and other people, it bothered me. She acted like she was a grown woman stuck in a sixteen year old's body. I wanted to smack her with the freaking book itself every time she opened her mouth. After the first twenty pages, I kept asking myself, “Is this what people are calling a good book?” Don’t even get me started on when they first met. What kind of person goes to someone’s house after they just met them? An IDIOT. Like hello, she even said so herself that he could be a murderer or a rapist! Plus, they are only teenagers. How can a sixteen year and a seventeen year old fall in love with each other in just one month?The hostess’s eyes lit up as Augustus and I walked toward her. “Mr. and Mrs. Waters?” “I guess?” I said.What?! All I could do was raise my eyebrows and wonder why the hell couldn’t a simple yes do? And why didn’t the hostess’s actually confirm it was them? Either you are Mr. and Mrs. Waters, or you're not.Another thing that bothered me was when Hazel and Augustus were texting each other and when she continued to just say “Okay”, even after he playfully said to stop flirting with her, she continued. Everything about her bugged the frick out of me.Augustus: I liked Augustus a lot more than I did Hazel. He seemed like a cool, funny guy. Although, he sometimes came off as dull and some of the things he said made me roll my eyes.He’s seventeen years old (remember that, I’m going to bring it up in a minute) and he speaks like he’s a freaking Shakespeare. His metaphor, the way he talked about death and especially the way he told Hazel he loved her..it made me stop and wonder, what kind of girl would find him all “amazing and poetic?“I'm in love with you, he said quietly.Augustus, I said.I am, he said. He was staring at me, and I could see the corners of his eyes crinkling. I'm in love with you, and I'm not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things. I'm in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, and I am in love with you.”To me, that is not romantic whatsoever. It felt like he wrote it down and rehearsed it in front of a mirror twenty times. I can barely go up to someone and say hello without stuttering and this guy already has a freaking speech in less than two seconds.“There will come a time when all of us are dead. All of us. There will come a time when there are no human beings remaining to remember that anyone ever existed or that our species ever did anything. There will be no one left to remember Aristotle or Cleopatra, let alone you. Everything that we did and built and wrote and thought and discovered will be forgotten and all of this will have been for naught. Maybe that time is coming soon and maybe it is millions of years away, but even if we survive the collapse of our sun, we will not survive forever. There was time before organisms experienced consciousness, and there will be time after. And if the inevitability of human oblivion worries you, I encourage you to ignore it. God knows that’s what everyone else does.”*Josh Hutcherson What? gif*Yes, cancer is a terrible, sad disease, but this book, it's just not believable for me. And for people to cry over such a poorly written book, it's mind boggling. I'm hoping the movie will be better than the book."
2,"ll start this by saying that I don't review things often (almost never unless I can just leave a score and be on my way), but I had such high hopes for this book that instead continuing to wait in my library queue, I gave in and purchased this book for my kindle.I'm a sap and I'll admit it.  Most of my bookshelf is filled with blood, guts, and all things Stephen King, but I love a good romance book (especially Nicholas Sparks style).  I went into this book expecting a good cry and hoping for a good, simple love story. Nothing about this book was simple or easy, but I will admit that I did get the cry session I expected.  Even though I knew the twist from the beginning of the book, I did cry for probably an hour reading it.  I love when a book can make me feel so emotional, but...*SPOILER*I hated this book.  I was angry at the end.  I felt like the characters in the book, chasing something that I never quite felt like I got.  When I reach the last sentence, I was wondering where the ending was.  Really?  Hazel tried to find out the ending to the novel for the whole book and she never got it? Instead of the conclusion she craved, she recieved a eulogy?  Did she die soon after the ending or did she linger for a while thanks to her meds?  This might not bother most people.  After ruining the entire book for my husband (only with his encouragement), he had no problems with the ending.  It bothered me though.Also, I'd like to know where in the world there are teenagers that talk like Hazel and Gus did in this book? Maybe it's because I'm a speed reader, but I like dialogue that flows easily and is believable.  I don't want to have to stop my reading to suss out the meaning behind what the character is saying.  I don't want to have to look up words or references while reading.  I read to escape, to get lost in a fantasy.  Once I allowed myself to just plow through the book and not worry so much about the bull, I was able to finish the book but I just hated how it ended.  I just didn't feel satisfied.  I was really looking forward to reading this book.  Maybe it's my fault for jumping into another trend without researching beyond the basic plot summaries listed on webpages.  I've watched what cancer does to a person firsthand, and I wanted to feel more of a connection to this book and these characters.I was going to give this book a 3/5 simply because I did have an emotional reaction, but ultimately I think that was because of my experiences with a loved one with cancer and a lack of sleep while reading this book.  I gave it a 2 because 2= didn't like it, and I just didn't like it."
1," agree with what some others have said - this is by far John Green's best work to date, and that's saying something.I read this in one sitting, was up half the night and went through a half a box of tissues. You WILL cry. And not just because this is a book about teenagers with cancer (it is) and not because John Green uses emotionally manipulative author tricks to pull the cry out of you (he doesn't - thank you John - 'cause I hate books that do that). You will cry because of the masterful way that John Green weaves a story full of love. You won't just cry when people get sick or when they talk about death (you will). But you'll maybe cry during tender parts where the love between Hazel and Augustus (Gus) is so real and so huge and so beautiful that you are filled with such appreciation for it that all you can do is cry. And you'll cry because Hazel understands the suffering of her parents and the love her small family has for each other.But you won't just cry. You'll laugh too, sometimes maybe even out loud. John is his usual super-smart witty self and the repartee between Hazel and Gus is funny, sometimes wicked and darkly funny. And then you throw Isaac into the mix and the three-way conversation is delicious.Many loved Green's Looking for Alaska. I did not love that book. I liked it fine, but honestly I felt that it tried too hard and was pretentious. That book made me a fan of John Green, but not a mega fan.The Fault in Our Stars tackles some of the same issues as Looking for Alaska but with so much more maturity and grace, that I can hardly believe it is by the same writer (except that it most certainly is - Green's unique voice is here and is certainly familiar to Green fans). But Green has had time to mature, both as a writer and a person, and I don't think you could ask for better treatment of such a tough and emotional subject as Green's tender hand in The Fault in Our Stars.Given that the book deals with death, and the inevitability that one feels from the start that a death will happen (it is a book about cancer after all), the book appropriately discusses the big questions: Is there a God? Is there more to us than just our bodies? I got the sense that John Green argued this theme with himself by way of three characters: Hazel, Gus and a cynical author Peter Van Houten. There's little to no attempt here on the part of the author to tell us what to think or provide some grand answer (though perhaps through Hazel's father's simple yet profound statements on the topic we get as close as we can to an answer). And to address a topic like this and not provide grand statements and answers takes a hand of restraint on the part of an author. I think this hand of restraint can only be exercised by an experienced author at the top of his game.My only fault with the whole book is that Hazel does not sound like a 16 year old girl - she sounds like John Green pretending to be a 16 year old girl. But just a few pages in, you'll forget that she sounds like John Green because you're so invested in her and Gus and the other characters that you'll forgive this one little fault.If I could give more than five stars I would. This is a knock out of the park homerun of a book.Thank you John Green for writing it."
2," chose this book to join the bandwagon with the movie release, and I'm glad I did. I enjoyed it, couldn't put it down, and cried...even when I told myself I wasn't going to. I'm glad I chose to read this and am looking forward to see the movie."
5," absolutely loved this book from the minute I opened it. It was so engaging and i just couldn't get enough, I wanted more. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves to get a little teary eyed over a book. John Green is an amazing author."
5,t's a wonderful book filled with emotions and hope.  The book is well written and have a fine dose of humor and drama.  I would think that John Green's daughter wrote the book instead of him because It sounds a lot like a teen.  I just love it.
5,"t's real. It's moving. A great read for young adults (high school age). I have teenagers of this age and the author seems to have captured that age's dialogue, angst, and viewpoint. Warning it's a book that once moving cannot be stopped easily."
5, This book plays with your emotions. I found  myself literally sobbing by the end. The writing  is so eloquent. John Green deserves every bit of praise he gets. I hope he finds a way to make adorable evolutionary advantaged puppy sized elephants.
5, The book has a way of flowing so that you've been reading for hours and the book is almost finished but you feel like it has only been a few minutes. John Green has a way of making me view life in a whole different way with every book he writes.
5, This book. What could you say about something so touching. I loved every minute of reading. My best friend has had a terminal illness since she was in 5th grade. She is a fighter. And will continue to be. I strongly urge that you read this book.
5,"m biased when it comes to stories like this. I don't have cancer, but I do have an illness that will one day kill me. I can understand the emotions Green wrote about better than a lot of people.However, I just couldn't connect with this book. The two main characters seemed like two halves of the same coin. Yes, teens can have deep, thoughtful discussions about life and death and what it all means. But they don't always use big words and extreme metaphors to do it. They don't sound like 30 year old trapped in teen bodies. I get that these are Green's characters and he can write them how he wants. But I think I would have liked reading these teen's words if they spoke like teens. You can have the same meaningful talks without coming across as slightly pretentious.I'll admit to not crying once during this book. I didn't even tear up. Maybe that makes me heartless, but there was just something missing and I think it goes back to how the characters thought and talked. They weren't teens in my head. It wasn't a teen romance centered on teens with cancer facing death. Facing a terminal illness makes you grow up a lot faster than anyone else, it's true. But it still doesn't make you an adult. It makes you a teen with some of the worst cards life can deal.The whole plot around Van Houten just felt unrealistic and forced. This book could have been just as thought provoking without the trip to Amsterdam. You don't need a huge trip to someplace special to have the same impact on readers.For all the hype that surrounded this book, I felt extremely let down. It wasn't what I thought it would be and left me feeling a little more annoyed than sad."
2," Disclaimer: I will not be censored for voicing my opinion. Also - this is the review you WISH you'd written...I started this book off not with five stars, as I do for all others, but with three. The narrator is a sixteen year old nitwit with so little reverence for either life or death that one quickly loses hope for this novel's redemption. Hazel is so mean-spirited and devoid of compassion that one wonders how this novel ever became a bestseller, let alone a movie.So about the character of Hazel - she mentions Aristotle and Cleopatra as if she knows a thing about either one, let alone any of the philosophies she spits out, and the whole novel comes off as merely a cancer-laden Twilight. She wonders why no one eats curry for breakfast. To her I would say, There IS a place where people eat curry for breakfast. That place is called India. Now shut up.Augustus says of Hazel, She is funny without ever being mean. What a lie! She attacks everyone around her.The novel does have a saving grace, however, in the character of Peter Van Houten, who explains to Hazel what it is to be a writer, and that not all questions can be answered in absolutes. However, Hazel treats the man horribly, and I feel like that is an understatement.John Green is obviously a very smart and talented writer. But alas! His skills are utterly wasted on teenage dialogue-filth-ridden dramas. And to him, I must also ask, Is this the price of fame - to write things like this? If it is, then good for you. But as for me, I will have no part of it.P.S. Unhungry is not a word that any self-respecting author should be using."
3," loved this book. And that sorta surprised me. A friend recommended it to me and she just raved about it. She said how it was so good and that I'd laugh and that I'd cry ... I told her to stop there because I'm not all about crying when I read. I love a good story but I don't usually want tears to go along with it if I can help it. I asked her what it was about and she said Well it's about these kids with cancer. But it's really funny! To which I responded That doesn't sound enjoyable at all! Ok, so fast forward a couple of months and I decided to check it out anyway. I was drawn in right away because it was so well written. I just really enjoyed the dialogue of the characters. It WAS funny. Hazel's narration and thought process was funny. Augustus was written to be funny. So, yeah, it was funny. But cancer is involved so ultimately it has its sad moments, too. I didn't give this book the full five stars simply because I felt it ended too soon. I don't want to spoil for those who haven't read, so I'll just say at a certain point in the book it all seems to move ahead super fast and ends quickly. With the characters written well and the dialogue flowing the way it did, there was plenty of room to just let the story tell itself a little bit more. It's a fairly short book so adding some pages wouldn't have hurt it at all. I'd still highly recommend it though. You can knock it out in a couple of days. And then you can say you read the book when the movie hits next year. Oh and I'm not sure that it matters, but I actually just checked this book out at my local library. Then I purchased the Kindle edition for $3.99 (pretty fair price - it was $9 or so when my friend purchased it.)"
2," A deeply emotional while funny story of teenage terminal cancer patients.The book centers around Hazel, who is forced to walk around with an oxygen tank and who knows that she has a limited time. Another patient, Gus, has lost a leg, and his cancer is in remission, while he also has an 80% chance that he'll beat it.Gus was a natural athlete and walks with a slight limp. Always joking, he's the type of person that you want to be around. He likes Hazel who doesn't want him to be burdened with someone who's going to die. Especially because she knows that his former girlfriend was also a cancer patient who passed away. Little by little they get to know each other, and share their likes, all the while making jokes between themselves and others about cancer and death.Hazel loves a certain book, which was the only book written by an author who now lives in Amsterdam. The book ended abruptly and it was a philosophical book. She gets Gus to read it and Hazel only wants to be able to go to Amsterdam to meet the author and ask him what happened to the characters.Through a make a wish type of organization, she had used her wish to go to Disney World, but Gus tells her that he's using his wish for the two of them to go to Amsterdam to meet the author.The journey of what they go through on a daily basis, the experience of seeing friends both passing away or losing limbs, and not knowing how much time is left,is wrenching, but the light hearted attitude of these teenagers is uplifting. The parents of these children also go through pressures and sometimes, the parents don't make it as a couple themselves.Very good and the subject is presented extremely well."
4," read The Fault in Our Stars on its recommendation by my 14-year-old granddaughter. I highly recommend it for teenagers.  The characters are stellar role models.  May we all raise children who value learning, literature, poetry, and kindness."
5," thought this was a wonderful book.  The author had an amazing perspective into the lives of teenagers struggling with issues way beyond their years.  It was creative, funny, heart-rending.  I'm a middle aged woman and I thought it was great."
5,"ntriguingly painful. I can never presume to feel something similar to someone with a terminal illness, but as always, the variations of John Green shine through his characters with thought provoking prose leaving me misty eyed and empathetic."
5," What must I say. From extravagant writings from the perspective of an average teenager, John Green has done the impossible. To write a book as a character of the opposite sex and maintain a reliable interest into the book, I say job well done."
5, THIS BOOK COULDN'T BE MORE AMAZING OR PERFECT IN ANY WAY. I'M JEALOUS OF ANYONE WHO IS READING IT BECAUSE I WANT TO EXPERIENCE THE MAGIC ALL OVER AGAIN. I FEEL BAD FOR ANYONE YOU HASN'T READ IT BECAUSE THIS BOOK IS LITERALLY LIFE. PLEASE READ.
5," chose this rating because this book was pure amazing. A love story, but still a tear wrenching novel. I loved it's deep tone, and quiet happiness. I would read it over and over if I could. But I don't enjoy crying my eyes out too many times."
5, John Green does not sugar coat the horrors and reality of dying. This book was tragically beautiful and the love that Gus and Hazel share is greater than any ever written. This is a magnificent book that I would highly recommend to any reader.
2,"t is such a beautiful story about a girl who has cancer and thinks shes going to die soon. U may think that romance stories Are corny, but you need to read it. Great story for teens or pre teens. May be to hard to understand for little kids."
5, haven't read a book like this in a long time. There were moments when I had to stop and pause and try to digest what the writer was trying to say. Needless to say I'll be reading this book about as much as Hazel read An Imperial Affliction.
5, This book is great and very said loved it. It's a very good book and it makes you to not stop reading it once u get started on it and get into it. I would recommend this book to anyone who lives heartfelt and sad but very interesting books!!!
5," ripped through this book and read it anyplace I possibly could! It made me laugh, cry (really it did), and really think life and death. After seeing how completely amazing this book is I will definitely be purchasing other John Green books!"
5," Very good reading, and its touching we sometimes forget about the people who are suffering or dying with diseases but in the midst of their suffering and their last days they can find things to smile about as they transcend to the other side."
5," Wow. It was almost painful to read this yet a great comfort at the same time. I love his honesty, quirkiness, and sick humor. If you have been or are chronically ill you will GET the nuances, the sick jokes, the small asks that are big feats."
5, completely adored this book. The remarkably imperfect characters are difficult to forget (not that you'd ever want to). I feel that The Fault In Our Stars is a strongly realistic and honest portrait of the struggle between living and dying.
5, this book was the greatest book i  have read in fourteen years. i was laughing one moment and sobbing the next. it was a roller coaster for me. i really enjoyed the characters in this book and their view on life. i highly recommend this book.

However, she is intrigued by his words as he shares his story.Augustus Waters lost his leg to cancer and uses a prosthetic but he did not lose his spirit in the process.Augustus catches Hazel off guard when he compliments her and asks her to come over to his place to watch a film. He manages to convince her and not scare her away with his driving skills or lack there of.The two connect over her favorite book An Imperial Affliction but the book ends abruptly leaving the reader with many unanswered questions. Augustus is determined to do whatever he can to get Hazel the answers she seeks. Even, if it means the two traveling to Amsterdam to get them.Life is a gift that can be taken at any moment. Make every moment count. In the end we all will be someones memory.I LOVED this book! I was pleasantly surprised at how  close the film adaption is to the book! Of course there were a few differences  off and on. However, I have not seen a film adaption so closely in-sync with the book in a VERY long time. WARNING read with a box of tissues near by. These kind of books do not normally make tears stream down but this book squeezed my heart and touched my soul.*Checkout and follow my blog:http://wicked-blogs.blogspot.com"
5," The Fault In Our Stars by John Green. This book is about, as we all know, a teenager named Hazel Grace, who at a young age was diagnosed with cancer. Her mom continued trying to convince her on going to a support group at a church, to socialize more,  who there she met a young boy named Augustus Waters. Since the first day a connection was made within them and they grew closer together as time went by. The more they spend time together, the stronger their feelings became. Augustus knew that he was in love with Hazel since they day he got to know her and he never doubted that love, and although Hazel knew she felt the same, she wouldn't admit it because she was too scared to hurt him, due to her diagnosis. They went threw many challenges together, their lives are completely rewritten, and from there on, nothing's ever the same.Even though I had already seen the movie before reading this book, I thought it'll be nice to get to see the story at a different point of view. I chose this book because John Green is one of my favorite authors and I have been reading every single one of his books lately. I really enjoyed this book and I know that this is one of the books I would come back and forth to it. I loved how there's a little bit of everything, happiness, sadness,  ect ect.Honestly, I would say that my favorite part would be the time when Hazel and Augustus met. The reason to that would be because they just clicked, they trusted each other since day one and from there on they never got apart. Whoever has read this would agree with me. The Fault in our Stars is such a beautiful story and I would recommend this to everyone because I know they would enjoy it!"
2," This book is so well written and a so easy to read, the words truly flow. Any reader that reads the first chapter will fall in love with the main characters,although, I was caught off guard where the book took me as I read it. I could not help but laugh at some of the unlikely antics these lovable characters pull  off without any hint from the author, John Green, that these antics were  sending a very strong message, to be understood at the conclusion of the book. This book should be available in middle schools on up as a mandatory read. Although, the title may be misleading, it is not a chic flick in the form one would expect, nor is it about anything scientific. This story could happen to anyone and the storyline sends so many messages to all ages, over and over in every single chapter. Although, I cried big tears, I also laughed and even felt some angry emotions as I read the book. The ending did suprise me, although I felt the book would end  with sadness. I was so shocked at how the book did end. I felt a true loss and after reading the first time, I had to start over, and read the book a second time.This book is fiction, it is so well written with  a great storyline, This scenerio  could happen to anyone at any age anytime. I wanted a happier ending, there are so many messages throughout the book . A few of the messages are very spelled out , with so many ways to take them,but in the same story, there are many unwritten messages as well, that will make one think,accept andmaybe even make you look differently at how one looks at life in general. The title actually does not tell the story, but it certainly describes the story in every single chapter."
5," chose this rating because this book was sheer perfection in its purest form.  I mean, I basically drove my friends crazy when I was babbling incoherently about this book. I finished it in one and a half days, because sadly I cannot sit all day in my blanket cocoon reading this gift to the world. I love  this book with a burning passion.  So it starts out with Hazel Grace Lancaster, a sixteen-year-old girl who's lungs had a panic attack and can't bring themselves to work on their own because they don't know how to keep their shit together.  So she goes to a support group for people like her (suffering from cancer but 'fighting strongly the entire way through'), because her mother thinks she's depressed and needs to get out of the house more.  During one of the group's meetings in the Literal Heart of Jesus, she notices the angel himself, Augustus Waters. Augustus Waters, the boy who lets the thing that can kill you sit on his lips but doesn't let it kill him. Hazel falls in love with him like you fall asleep. Slowly, then all at once. I'm sorry, I'm using a lot of stuff from the book but that's basically me showing that I do in fact love the book with every piece of my Literal heart.But then the most devastating thing happens. HE DIES DIES HE DIES OKAY. I was sobbing when I was reading all of his heartbreaking suffering that led up to my breaking point. But I will confess that I highlighted the entire letter that he wrote for Hazel. I have nothing more to say, I have let about twenty per cent of my emotions flow out, if I let myself write out everything that I want to write I my end up writing a novel of my own."
5," Sad . But wonderful.made me feel things about life,how short it is.how little time we really have.Tell people you love them all the time.because we never no how long we have.and if we live to be old how wonderfully blessedWe are."
5, loved his use of language and the creativity of his made-up language which helped to ease the seriousness of the topic. I would recommend this book to absolutely everyone. It's made me want to check out all. The rest of John Green's books.
4," There are few books that make me cry after a second reading, but just about every John Green book pulls at your heart. I'm picky about my favorite novels, but I knew this one was on my list within a few pages.Buy it. Read it. Share it."
5," thoroughly enjoyed this book and fell in love with the smart and sarcastic characters that were brought to life in it. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. Heavy material, but the story and characters are just so engaging. Loved it."
5,ve read several of his books but The Fault in Our Stars remains my favorite. Whether he is writing female or male characters their voices are always so genuine and relatable I get sucked right in and can't put it down! Highly recommended!!
5, thought this book was a really interesting way to look at cancer - it was hard that the main characters were teenagers suffering but I liked the perspective it brought. It was easy to fall in love with the characters and be on their sides.
5, understood Augustus and Hazel and felt so much of what they were going through. The story has a sad happiness. I loved the humor along with the unusual witty takes on life and cancer. Truly a great book and I will recommend it to everyone.
5," John Green is an amazing writer. He has inspired me to write books; and this book has inspired me even more.It's a beautiful story, it had me in tears. When it ended, I screamed of sadness.Keep it up, John, you're great. &lt;3"
2," have read An Abundance of Katherines, Looking for Alaska, and Paper Towns, and this is John Green's best book yet. I loved it. This book will make you smile, laugh, and cry. It's witty and an enjoyable read. I highly recommend it. DFTBA &lt;3"
5," am going to write this quickly before my indignation subsides.Hazel`s consistent theme throughout the book was, the fact that you have a horrible disease doesn't obligate you to seek immortality or achieve some heroic act. The simple fact that a book was written about her, from her perspective, negates her whole point. I don't think she would be very happy being obligated to provide hope for people that don`t have any.The ending that parallels Von Houten`s ending was predictable and irritating.The point - to slam home the fact that the dead don't know how the rest of the story ends and we should feel the finality that they do.Augustus would be mortified (his words) if he knew that instead of a grand historic act we were forced to witness his indignities.Guess what? Survivors don't get some lightning flash of inspiration that tells us we were saved because; we could cure cancer, save some baby from choking, invent something that negates global warming, world peace. Some times they just continue on living an ordinary life.If Augustus survived and read all of his indignities paraded before a grasping public he would be pissed and probably smash a few trophies. No one. NO ONE wants to read in print the ramifications of any illness, accident, and all that comes with it. First hand experience an email with updates about me and the word anus used more than once.The entire book I felt like I was invading their privacy and reading about someone who would not have wanted a book written about her.If you like to cry and feel helpless go ahead and read this. Spoiler Alert: If you are going through a similar struggle and maybe a teenage virgin go ahead and read it and give yourself hope that you too can lose your virginity to the love of your life before you get too sick.It's time to go take more pain meds and possibly talk to the doc about upping my ant depression meds. And before you comment berating me or agreeing, I seriously do not care so save yourself the time."
5," After all the buzz about this book, I finally decided to read it. Wow, what a disappointment. The dialogue didn't feel real to me at all. The characters weren't believable. And the ending was obvious. I don't understand the love for this book."
1," bought this book after seeing all the hype surrounding it and the movie and was so dissapointed, hated it and wished i had started with any of his other books, the story just never went anywhere, and im still struggling to get through it."
1," could not put this one down. I started and just had to keep reading til the end. Augustus, what a sweet heart! The book is highly emotional and plays on all feelings. You feel happy, sad, grief, laughter, everything. Great Job John Green!"
1, This book is an intimate look into the emotional and physical lives of teen cancer victims.  The writing and insight are exceptional.  One can't help being drawn into the triumphs and tragedies of the characters.  It is an exceptional read.
5," laughed. I cried. I laughed again. I cried again.I finished it in one sitting. I already knew what was going to happen, it was inevitable. The things that happened in between were just sweet, comforting and unconditional love."
5," This beautiful, heart-tugging, mind stretching Young Adult novel centers hauntingly around cancer-stricken students, especially focusing on Hazel Grace and her cancerous lungs and the Augustus (Gus) who befriends her.  They meet at a cancer anonymous center in an old church, where Gus, who has beaten cancer but lost a leg in the process, mesmerizes Hazel who slowly falls in  love with him.  Their parents are very supportive.  Hazel has read a certain book numerous times that ends abruptly without a conclusion.  She and her male friend make use of his  Cancer Wish to make a trip to thepicturesque Netherlands, with her mother, to visit the reclusive author to find out what happened to the characters in the book after the alleged death of a child with cancer.  There are numerous thoughts about the meaning of life, youth angst, and generous quotes from various famous authors.  The novel is both sad and emotion-wrenching but also inspiring through the unquenchable spirits of the characters, whom the author John Green has fleshed out well..  Have some tissue handy--you who are prone to tears! I guarantee that the reader will find it almost impossible to lay the novel aside once he or she starts reading it. I was so impressed by the fate of the characters that I immediately ordered two more of John  Green's works:  Looking for Alaska and Paper Towns, the latter a popular mystery.  All three titles are Kindle e-reader versions.  A final note: Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort, the brother and sister Tris and Caleb in the book and film Divergent, by Veronica Roth, co-star in the film version of The Fault in Our Stars that is due out in theaters later this year."
5," (Long review- So I'll save time by saying this is one of my all time favorite books)So I bought this book earlier this year, along with 8 or 9 others (I had all of spring break to read them and I wasn't going to waste any time). Unfortunately, this book, being one of the first that I purchased, was at the bottom of my stack and I wasn't able to read it. Skip forward a few months and I noticed it on my Kindle, still sitting there, unread and silently screaming to be read. Me, being me, picked it up at 9:30 that night, prepared to read a few chapters, and then go to sleep. Lo-and-behold, 1:30 rolled around and I was caught. Physically my eyes couldn't strain open anymore, but mentally I was begging my eyes to remain open, just for a minute longer. Unfortunately, my eyes and I don't agree on these types of things and I was forced to go to sleep... However, the moment I awoke I was reading again. I finished the book at around 9am. Tears rolling down my face as I slowly turned the pages. My family all wondering what could have possibly happened to elicit a response of this nature.As far as the book goes? I couldn't recommend it enough. It takes a topic that most of us are familiar enough (we may not know someone that has a terminal illness, but we can empathize, to a degree) with, and brings it around to a whole new level. Before this book, I didn't really think about death, it just wasn't something that I ever thought I would worry about. This book, however, changed that opinion real fast and in-a-hurry. Bravo John Green, you did something that I didn't know was possible, you put a new book at the top of my permanent reading list!"
5," read this book at first because many of my friends urged me to do so. But after reading the first couple pages I really got into it. And I loved every second of it. This was an amazing book, and I hope you find it as I found it: perfect."
2," Honestly, through the beginning of this book I was pretty disappointed, being kinda bored. But then I fell in love with it, and I couldn't put it down. I cried, from the beautiful way he'd talk and ahhhh yes I definitely recommend it 100%!"
5, This is one of those books that you begin reading and just can't put down. John Green's writing draws you in and makes you feel like they are your new friends! I've recommended this book to so many people. It's one that will stay with you.
5," This book is amazing, really well written. Some of it can be a bit hard to understand and requires reading it slowly, but overall it's excellent. John Green is a terrific writer. The package itself arrived on time and in perfect condition."
5," Loved it, it makes you laugh, makes you worry, makes you think about life and apppreciate what we have, it also breaks your heart but at the end is a story of pure strenght and will to live each day the best you can. I highly recommend it."
5," choose to read John Green books because he understands the human-ness that we all try so hard to see. Reading his stories isn't about escaping or about hiding, but rather about finding out about the human-ness of it all and embracing it."
5," This was one of the greatest books that I have ever read. It is a privilege to be able to explore the minds of two incredible characters. John Green is an excellent writer, and I hope you all have the privilege of reading this masterpiece."
5," This was easily the best book I have read in years. Green 's selective choice of poetry  made me literally speechless. The plot left me begging for more, and I am not ashamed to say that I cried several times throughout. Cliche perfection."
5," Where do I begin... **spoilers**I don't understand why millions of people (maybe they are mostly teenagers) like this book. I have never heard a sixteen year old or seventeen year old talk the way the two main characters do. Very unrealistic. There were a lot of section in the book I thought were drawn out and could have been shortened. Like when Hazel goes shoe shopping, or the long talk with the author. It reminded me of the architects speech in The Matrix. The ending was very predictable and I wasn't shocked at the end, but at the same time was wondering if there would be a twist to make me like the book more, but it never came. I didn't like how the death of Gus was just thrown out there. I would have thought that if the 2 characters were that in love with each other that Hazel would have been there with him when he died. I didn't like Gus sending the pages to the author. I wanted him to hide them for Hazel to find. I did like the breaks in the chapters and it was a quick read for sure.Does John Green write beautifully? Yes. One of the saving graces of this book, but besides that, I don't see the buzz. I probably won't be reading any more of his books. I wanted to see what the hype was about this book, and I was disappointed. I hope teenagers that read is book realize that love doesn't happen like that. It's not insta-love. Especially at that age. The whole pre-sex part was creepy and uncomfortable. The kissing in the Ann Frank museum I found weird and disrespectful.The book didn't make me cry (maybe I'm cold hearted), and I couldn't relate to the characters, cancer or not. Maybe if the characters were older I might have liked it more, but didn't."
5," Wow! It is almost 4 in the morning and I barely finished reading this masterpiece! I avoided reading this book for a very long time because I don't typically like reading sad books because, well, they make me sad. However, I just couldn't resist after so many great reviews and I'm forever grateful that I listened.The Fault in Our Stars is incredibly well-written. I laughed, I cried, I swooned, I cried and cried some more. I also feel as if I learned new things about myself and can now view certain situations from a different perspective than I would have prior to reading this book.As someone who witnessed my mom suffer from cancer and knowing she only had 6 months to live, I can completely relate to the families of these cancer patients. It's the most difficult experience I've ever endured in my life and having to be strong and put on a brave face for the one you love takes a tremendous amount of strength. Especially when you see them looking worse and worse everyday. My mom was one of the lucky ones who survived past the 6 months and is now 12 years in remission, but she came incredibly close. So close that it never ceases to amaze me how she's still alive.TFIOS had me reliving everything but with a different mindset. Augustus Waters is the most profound and mesmerizing character I've ever come across. His words have seared their way into my memory and I will be taking his words of wisdom along with me everywhere I go. No longer will I complain of the little unimportant things, because there are so many things to be grateful for. As Augustus said, I'm on a roller coaster that only goes up, my friend."
5," was so hesitant to read this book, especially after watching the movie trailer because I knew tears would be inevitable. And man, were there tears! In fact they haven't stopped. Not because of the sadness of the plot but because of the sheer beauty and brilliance that is John Green's work. I am so happy I read it, even though it caused a slew of emotions. Honestly, that is what makes it an excellent book. Despite how much I read, very few books get to me like this one did and in fact the only other that brought unstoppable tears was 13 Reasons Why.I normally don't quote books but this is too good not to:Sure, I fear earthly oblivion. But, I mean, not to sound like my parents, but I believe humans have souls, and I believe in the conservation of souls. The oblivion fear is something else, fear that I won't be able to give anything in exchange for my life. If you don't live a life in service of a greater good, you've gotta at least die a death in service of a greater good, you know? And I fear that I won't get either a life or a death that means anything. ~Augustus Waters, The Fault in Our StarsIn a nutshell, that is Augustus (aka Gus) Waters- his incredible strength and character and how he was with Hazel, and even with Isaac and that darn Peter- well fictional character or not- the world needs more Augustus's in it. Heck, the world needs more Hazels in it too, just maybe with less suffering but then again their struggles and battles made them who they are.Everyone needs to read this book. I can only hope that the movie comes close, though the clips I have seen quoted the lines almost exactly."
2," bought this book on my Kindle due to the large number of positive reviews, even though I wasn't a big fan of John Green's book Looking for Alaska. I'm glad I gave it a chance, because this book was great. The characters were well-developed, and Green nailed the way teenagers talk; I also really appreciated the depth of Hazel and Gus' relationship. It contained none of the completely over-the-top nonsense in some YA books that just makes you roll your eyes. These kids had some perspective, and the result is a beautiful tale about friendship and love.Plus, this book made me cry: any book that makes me cry gets at LEAST 4 stars. I am NOT usually a crier.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of some unrealistic aspects of Hazel's medical situation; I know most people don't care and that the author is free to bend reality as he sees fit considering this is a work of fiction, but I'm a pediatric ICU nurse so it kinda bothered me. There's a lot more that you can do for the lung issues she was having besides just BiPAP at night and chest tubes, but the most eyebrow-raising thing to me was that she walks around on home oxygen yet doesn't have a pulse oximeter at home to tell her what her oxygen level is. Just not realistic; unlikely that she'd be walking around under-oxygenated for weeks in real life without knowing it. That being said, I understand this is a work of fiction and such details don't matter to most people, so take my 1-star deduction with a grain of salt unless you're a medical person as well.Overall this book was very good. Made me much more open to reading John Green books in the future!"
5," bought this book for my 13 year old daughter to read over the summer...I'm reading it too. Half way through the book, I find it to be a pleasant read...it's well written and the topic is profound, but I do think the the philisophical deepness of the two main characters is a bit too unrealistic for people of their age. But that doesn't bother me. What bothers me is this ever growing desire to expose our young people to sexuality through media. Our kids don't need to be nudged and encouraged into sex and sexual thoughts...nature will take care of that, and I guess I don't appreciate the author's need to have his characters discuss topics such as riding one-legged ponies all the way around the corral or whether or not the main character should consider the virtues of being on top. The story would be great, emotional and touching without the sexual content...in fact as I understand it, the real life character never had sex or sexual contact with her real life male counterpart (she needed an oxygen tank to BREATH for crying out loud), yet the author felt it necessary to include sex in his telling of the story. I feel like the authors of these books (The Hunger Games, Divergent, TFIOS, etc) for young adults must all be sexually repressed, and find it convenient to satisfy their sexual needs vicariously through literature. I'd like to say to them...if you're not getting any at home then get your rocks off by writing 60 Shades of Blue for adults and leave our children out of your literary booty calls. Our young people will find their way to sex naturally, and hopefully through the council of their parents. We don't need your help."
4,"’m not even sure what I can say about this book that hasn’t been said already. It’s a beautiful story that will rip you apart. It’s painful and that pain demands to be felt. But within the pain there is beauty and first love and just a truly wonderful story. Again, these are all things that have been said before countless times, but they are worth repeating.Augustus and Hazel’s relationship is beautiful. There is no other way to describe it. These two were clearly made for each other. Not even referencing the cancer, but just in their personalities. They both spoke their own language that a lot of other people didn’t even come close to understanding. Their relationship is easily one of my favorites ever.What I also loved about this book is the humor. In spite of the terrible situation it was very funny. I laughed out loud on numerous occasions. The banter between Hazel and Augustus is priceless and hysterical and I loved every single second of it. But at the same time it is a serious book and the horrible reality of cancer isn’t glossed over. John Green shows the ugly side of it and doesn’t bypass the uglier sides of it. It is a love story at its center but it is a love story that deals with pain and loss. The love doesn’t fix everything but it is a beacon of light within a lot of darkness.There are a lot of other things I could say about this book but I really don’t even know where to begin. It is wonderful and heartbreaking… oh my God is it heartbreaking! It tore me apart! It makes you feel and it makes you hurt, but it also makes you smile and laugh. It is an astounding and heartbreakingly beautiful read!"
3, Ok maybe I do. This book will delight you with it's wit and charm and then rob you of your soul as you ache for these two characters that you have begrudgingly come to love knowing full well that they will soon leave a scar on your heart.
5," One of the best stories I have read in a long time.  The characters were so real.  Even though they were going through difficult times, they found a way to find the positive.  I felt good about the world after I read this.  You will, too."
5, thought this book was great. I love the way John wrote this I dislike some events that happen but overall it is a great book. I would recommend this book to people who like love story's or sad books or anyone who wants to see the movie.
5," This book is perfect. I didn't read it till after I saw the preview for the movie and when I did, I read it in 4 days. It's a perfect love story and shows how hard cancer can be and is real. I would definitely recommend reading this book."
5," really liked this book.  Unlike some books that one can't put down, this one I could, as I was not in a hurry for it to end.  It was a comfortable story about an uncomfortable, though all too real, subject.  Love the tongue in cheek wit"
5," read this book in about 3 1/2 hours. I literally sobbed through this entire book worrying about each character but too intrigued by their story to stop reading. If you can, read this slowly and take it all in. It is well worth the time."
5," This is by far one of my favourite books! It's so heart breaking but I guess that's cancer, right? Hazel is such a strong female character, she has to be my favourite female character aside from Katniss Everdeen (The Hunger Games Trilogy)"
2, This book is fabulous!! I can't even explain how much a enjoyed this book! I think that it is a book that everyone should read. It gives a new outlook on life and you end up feeling for the characters! I loved it...but have tissues ready!
5," When I first realized that I was reading a book about kids with cancer, I thought that I'd been hoodwinked. I didn't want to be depressed. I was not depressed and neither will you be. Cleverly written and deeply thoughtful. I'm impressed."
5," This has to be the best book I've read, going through an illness myself this have me a whole new outlook on everything. A part of me has changed since reading this and I'm glad I picked up such a magnificent book to spend my time reading."
5, This is the second book I have read by Green. He is an amazing writer who knows how to pull at my heart strings as well as making me see a lot of myself in his characters. The fault in our stars is a great read and I finished it in a day.
5," have never written a review in my life but i found this book so funny, sad, poignant and honest that i think everyone should give it a go. if you like stories about human relationships then this is definately a book for you. i loved it!"
5, Beautifully written. My best friend died of brain cancer two years ago. Although this book hit painfully close to home for me it gave a real depiction of cancer that I think she would have found refreshing. I wish she could have read it.
5,"ve read, and liked, YA novels in the past.  But this one just didn't do it for me.  Thought I wanted to see the movie but now, no thanks.  I can get around the dying.  Mostly it was the YA dialogue that kept me from liking it, I think."
5, would recommend this book to a teacher or a friend. I like this book because it is set differently other than an un sick relationship. There is nothing to dislike about this book.  The movie is based on the book. Loved it so much!!!!!!
1," Be prepared to have your eyes and heart torn open with a new understanding.  Reading this book is equivalent to experiencing a terrifying and exciting climb to the apex of a monster roller coaster, knowing the drop could stop your heart."
5," This book is by far one of the best romantic books ever I laughed, died of heartache, and cried through this book EVERYBODY has to read this book its a MUST READ book!!!! Can't wait for the movie comes out in 25 more days #TFIOS #June6th"
2," loved this book. It reminds me that other people have harder lives than me and to take nothing for granted.. Now I wan to meet Augustus waters, he seems hot and he has pretty eyes. I recommend this book to anyone who likes a good book."
5," have never read a book that made me feel this much. You can't help but fall in love with the characters. Beautifully written with such clever dialogue that it restores my hope in an intelligent future generation. Bless you, John Green."
5," Wow-what a story!  I loved these characters.  I laughed and I cried, but I will think of this book and these characters for days to come!  If this peaks your interest at all, I strongly suggest you invest in the eBook and read and enjoy!"
5," Yes, this book is about teenagers, but it's really about life and love. I enjoyed this book so much that I came home from lunch to finish it. I think that the message applies to all ages. Highly recommend this emotional and cleaver book."
5," When I first bought this book, I didn’t even think of how attached I would come to this book. I have read this book about 6 or 7 times. The first time I read it I read it in about a day and a half to 2 days because I couldn’t put it down. Once I started, I couldn’t stop. The book has such a good story line, along with all of the other books John Green has written. He is such an amazing writer and his works show it. But, as much as I cried during the movie, I cried even harder when I read the book.In this book, Hazel Grace is a teenage cancer patient and her mother makes her go to a Cancer Kid Support Group. While she was there, she met Augustus Waters, another cancer patient that Hazel falls in love with. When Hazel and Augustus got invited to come to Amsterdam, Hazel received some very bad news. Augustus’s cancer had returned. When they returned home, Augustus’s cancer had gotten worse, so Augustus decided to have a prefuneral so that he could hear Hazel’s, and his best friend Isaac’s speech. Whenever Augustus dies, Hazel is heartbroken, but she will always love him.Like I said, this is one of my favorite books and it has a very good message. It brilliantly explores the funny, thrilling, and tragic business of being alive and in love.In conclusion, overall this book is a very good book for a teenager looking for a good book. I think in some ways every teenager can relate to this book whether it is being in love, or going through problems like Hazel and Augustus. I highly recommend this book to any teenager or young adult. In fact, I recommend this book to any age. I think anyone would like this book."
5," The Fault in Our Stars, by John Green is his most successful book by far, having a movie made and being a New York Times bestseller as well. Even with all the hype this book got I would rather die than read this book a second time. The book starts off with the main character being introduced, her name being Hazel Grace Lancaster. She has stage IV thyroid cancer and is only hanging on as a phalanxifor miracle patient and blah blah blah, that sentence is literally how boring the rest of this book is. The biggest flaw in this book is the characters, the author’s need to use more sophisticated and intricate language gets in the way of the realism of the characters. I will not and will never believe that a seventeen year old child with cancer will words like “bereft” or “cohort” or “contemporaneity” in everyday language. Like at some times the characters are immature shouting things like “HUMP THE MOIST CAVE WALL” but at other times they talk about the concept of some infinities being vastly larger than others. The errors in character continuity are very obvious here. The author also fails to build tension, everything seems to happen too fast, like if the author was writing and then lost his train of thought and just moved on to the next topic without ending the current one; which makes the entire plot boring and gave it the ability to lose your attention.In the end I wouldn’t recommend this book, I don’t think you should invest time or money to read this book, if you really want to know what happened just watch the movie because the actors could probably use more believable language than the author can for teenagers."
5," The book, The Fault in Our Stars, written by John Green is a young adult romance novel about the struggles and adventures of two teens with cancer. The story is about a girl named Hazel, who has cancer which affects her lungs. Her parents force her to go to cancer support group because they think she can make friends there because she doesn't have very many friends and spends most of her time re-reading a book. At support group, she meets a boy who used to have cancer named Augustus Waters. Over the course of time, she begins to fall in love with him. Augustus uses his wish to take Hazel to Amsterdam because she used her wish on Disneyworld. Augustus knew he was going to die because his cancer had came back and he wanted to spend his last months with Hazel, so he used his wish to take a trip with her. A few weeks later, after returning home, Augustus had a relapse that put him in the hospital. Hazel tried to spend every waking moment with him and one night she got a phone call saying he had passed away. Hazel was heartbroken because she had thought she was going to be the one to die, but instead, Augustus did. This book was very emotional for me because around seven years ago, my friend had leukemia and she passed away. The Fault in Our Stars shows how hard it is to lose someone you really care about, and I could relate to how Hazel felt when Augustus died. I would recommend this because if you're looking for a book that touches your heart and keeps you interested, this book by John Green is the right book for you. It's hard to put this book down because of all the events taking place and your emotional involvement with the characters."
2," This review isn't going to contain a summary of the book, because of a vlogbrothers requesting there be no spoilers about the book itself. Instead, I will focus more so on the quality of him as an author, versus this book's plot itself. However, let me say that this is John Green at his best. It has extreme highs, and new levels of low, and it catches every emotion in between.The power of John Green's writing isn't that he writes about teenagers, but rather for teenagers. Many authors who write about teenagers often times glorify the young adult life, with the over done romantics and an endless amount of everyone-gets-what-they-want. They do not catch real life, instead of including the bumps and scratched caused by fighting with parents, or swearing, or just doing stupid teenagery-type things, they smooth them over and play up the love between character A and character B.  John Green, on the other hand, writes for teenagers, and this is why I have so much respect for him as an author. In all of his books, he captures what teenagers really do in most of his books, silly half-baked plans that somehow manage to work, the fact that we do swear, and the occasional sexual experience. The only way I can describe his writing style is by saying it is honest. He captures the things that we sometimes miss, like crustless sandwiches, the guilty pleasure of reality TV shows, or those moments in time that stretch on for an infinity in our minds (even if they only happened for a minute or two in real life). A comparison that I can think of to explain my opinion better, is that many authors write similar to this: I got this cool scar by wrestling with an Alligator, which highlights and two things: 1. I have a cool scar and 2. I wrestled an Alligator. Instead, John Green's style is much more: I got this scar by wrestling with an Alligator, I cried some, and it hurt a lot, and there was a ton of blood, and I lost a pinky... Man I miss my pinky.In addition to John Green's ability to capture the little details that are often times forgotten in the grander schemes, he also is an amazing crafter of stories. He layers and blends in foreshadowing wonderfully, creates deliciously quotable quotes, infuses tons of humor, and creates characters so fleshed out I feel I know them better than many people in my high school class. Another reason why I am a fan of John Green's work (especially The Fault in Our Stars) is the tone that he writes with and the character voice. For me, his books feel like a bedtime story, the kind that you want to hear to relax you, keep you awake to know what happens, but always want to save a sliver because you never want them to end, and when you finally finish the book it has a sense of completeness to it that, very rarely, leaves me wondering: What Happens Next? His writings are delectable, and The Fault in Our Stars is a fine addition to his other works, and is probably my favorite book of his to date.Even with John Green reading the first two chapters of The Fault in Our Stars on his and his brother's youtube channel, I really did not know what to expect. It was an addicting read, and one that I could not put down until it ended. Then I read it again, because I did not want the journey to stop. If you are on the fence about this book, I would suggest getting it. I have been reading John Green since his first book, and I've never been disappointed. He is a powerful writer, with the ability to cram so much life into a relatively small book. For me, it was a piece of fiction, that was a slice of a little-known-reality, and for that I say thank you."
5," Sharing your opinion and impressions soon after you've finished a beautifully written peace of literature is always challenging. However, it feels right to express it: not only for the enjoyment of other people, but rather for your own feelings and emotions.To praise this book with the words of affection, astonishment, and appreciation would be too dim in comparison with the amount of light it brought to my inner world. It took me awhile to discover this type of story, but shortly after I my eyes met the characters of Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters, I already knew it was the beginning of a beautiful journey. I loved every chapter of it, its ups and downs, honesty and purity. Not to mention how witty it is. Everything about this book makes you want to meet the love of YOUR life, and make an Okay your Always.I cannot help but mention this book's relationship with its motion picture companion, for those of you who might be interested. Even though I watched the movie first, it did not spoil the reading experience in any way. The only downside is that your mind tends to compare and picture everything that happened exactly the way it did in the movie, and rejoice every time the book took a different turn or revealed some unmentioned scenes. For that I was absolutely blown away by the book. The depth and honesty of the dialogues made me feel present, experiencing compassion and understanding.I am a firm believer that a true love really does exist, and every one of us deserves to, at least, touch it while reading stories like The Fault in Our Stars. And for this, I am grateful to its author. Kudos!"
5," This book was eloquently written with the hard truth without any sugercoating. It give  you a sense of things gained and lost, and spins a heartwarming/heartwrenching tale that makes you want to either laugh or cry very hard at the end."
2," This is an amazing story! I love romance stories, but unless it has good details and isn't boring, I lose interest quickly. This was the perfect amount of romance and interestingness (I don't know if thats a word!) For me.:)"
5, One of the best books I've read in awhile. The author is great at eliciting emotion from the characters. Portrays sadness in a way to hope for a better world. Gives great outlook for a person looking in. Well written and worth the read!
5, could not put the book down for one minute. An epic love story! One that was brutally honest. This book really gets you thinking about how lucky we really are. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.I would recommend it to everyone I have ever met!
5," This was one of the best books I have read in a long time.  I cried,  laughed and rooted for the characters.  What I liked about it was that it was real.  I could have put myself in her shoes easy.  I would HIGHLY recomend reading this!"
5, fell in love with Looking for Alaska...and I was a little cautious that this could live up to the hype. How wrong I was...A must read for anyone! I even applaud at the end as I watched the story unfold in my mind. Truly one of a kind.
5," John Green is a fantastic writer. This book is so easy to relate to and honestly made me feel every emotion whilst reading it and it also made me cry, which not many writers can do. I will definitely be getting more books by John Green."
5," John Green really gets us, teenagers. We don't even know what is going on in our minds when already you have put it down on paper. The tale is truthful, I wouldn't be surprised if it where true. Must you deny the need to read this book?"
5," Probably one of the best books I've ever read. It'll make you laugh, fall in love, and cry all at the same time. I personally don't like to read. At all. My friend pushed me to read this book so I did. Best decision ever. Buy it. BUY IT"
5,"t broke my heart from the beginning to the end, but I loved everything about it. I do not want to spoil it, so I will just say that it is the best book I have read in a while. You would be doing yourself a disservice if you pass it up."
5," Hazel attends--at her mother's wishes--a cancer support group, where one day one of the regulars, Isaac, brings his friend Augustus Waters. Hazel and Augustus hit it off--with amazing chemistry--from their first encounter. If you came for the romance, you will not leave empty-handed. You'll also get these lovely parting gifts:-  The other characters. Hazel and Augustus are amazing--in a category all their own--but each of the other characters has a place in my heart also: tender-hearted and witty Isaac; Hazel's emotional and loving parents; bizarre and reclusive Peter Van Houten; Peter, the eternally cheerful and trite leader of the support group in The Literal Heart of Jesus--it goes on.-  Laughs. I'm not talking about chuckles, though those occurred from time to time. I'm talking guffaws that woke my husband and sister. Oops. John Green kept this up throughout the book. It was truly amazing how he had me going right through the end.-  Tears. If I wasn't laughing, I was crying. Part of this is terribly sad, and I think you're prepared for that from the beginning. There's no escaping it. Green still seems to make almost every awful moment bittersweet, though--redeemable in some small way. It ended up just making me cry harder. Then there are the downright heartwarming moments--and there are plenty. Well, in that case, there was nothing else to do: the tear ducts were already warmed up, after all.Just in case this was lingering in your yeah-I-keep-meaning-to-read-that pile, pull it out. There's no reason to keep you in suspense with my opinion or rating for this one--it's a solid five for me."
2," Like Hazel Grace said 'As he read, I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once.'This was me with the book as I am reading I'm falling more and more in love with this book and you just know in the back of you mind that you heart will get broken.I love how strong Hazel Grace is and the fact that she has this attitude of I have cancer so what.August Winter with his metaphors and big dramatic Gestures. Isaac and his night of the broken trophies .The Characters felt real and the way they act is real. It shows the other part of cancer/survivor patients. The pain and the conflict with in themselves makes this story and book real. How Hazel is Affraid to hurt everyone and then becomes the strong one.From the beginning of the book you laugh and smile and that makes this book great. It did have a twist I did not see coming. And believe me you won't see it either (don't want to give a spoiler) All I can say is from about chapter 17 single tears came down my cheek and the BAMMM all at once I had my ugly cry - the cry that is reserved for Titanic, Armagedon, Broken hearts and Funerals. A piece of my heart was pulled out and stomp on like broken trophies - my night of a broken heart. This book I will suggest to everyone and anyone who is looking for a real love story with first love and heart ache.  80 years from now this book will be among the Classics such as Pride and Prejudice and How to kill a mocking jay.I did not cry as much in the movie as in the book - I knew what was going to happen"
5," This book was the most beautiful book I have ever read. I have never cried so much reading a book before, and even though at times I thought I couldn't keep reading, I couldn't tear my eyes away from it. This book was about a young girl Hazel Grace, or Just Hazel lol, who has thyroid cancer that has spread to her lungs. Hazel knows she's not going to live long because her cancer is terminal. Her parents thinking she us depressed sends her to a support group. At this support group she meets her friend Isaac and the love of her life Augustus. Augustus is in remission and only has one leg, because the cancer he had affected his bones. At first Hazel does not want to pursue a relationship with Augustus because she is afraid of dying and hurting him. She often relates herself to a grenade. Augustus had already lost a girlfriend to cancer and she didn't want it to happen again because she believes she will be the first to go. Or so she thinks. Augustus' cancer comes back and spreads throughout his entire body. He knows he is not going to survive and one day has a prefuneral with Isaac and Hazel and asks them to give eulogies. Hazel told him he would instead give one at her funeral. Even though he died he did in fact write a eulogy and sent it off to the writer of their favorite book, whom, using Isaacs wish they had met, in order to try to figure out the end of the book because they author ended it in the middle of a sentence. They didn't find their answers on this trip but it was when Hazel realized just how much she loved Gus. I would recommend this book to anyone. Would I reread it? Maybe if I could get through the tears again."
5, One of the best teen books written today. Adults will find it enlightening and very real. It evoked a great deal of emotion - from highs to lows. It was heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time - unusual combination in books today.
5, Green knows how to tell an enjoyably sad story that makes you see the world differently. He makes you think about death (something no one wants to think about) in a way that almost makes you no longer fear it.  I need to read it again.
5," read  The fault in Our stars because, I wanted to read a gushy romantic story and that’s exactly what it wasn’t-in a good way. The book was absolutely heartwarming. It goes into the reality of teenage heartbreak. But, in another dimension. My explanation for that is, imagine a teenage love story being attacked by terminal cancer. The story begins with seventeen-year old Hazel Grace Lancaster, she is diagnosed with severe lung cancer called “Thyroid.” On her mother’s behest, she is forced to attend a cancer patients’ support group. A young boy named Augustus Waters immediately catches her eye. Augustus had a type of cancer called “Osteosarcoma,” but he is now cancer free and had his leg amputated. He is at the support group on the behalf of his mutual friend, Isaac. Isaac had a tumor in one eye that he had removed, but now he has to have the other one taken out. Leaving him blind. Augustus and Hazel grow close and fall hopelessly in love.  They share the same interests; reading the book An Imperial Affliction. In the end, a heartbreaking twist occurs. I’d be giving too much away if I revealed the rest. You’ll have to read the book to find out. I highly recommend this book to readers that want to cry. I really enjoyed the book because, it was not only humorous, it was real. It wasn’t a typical love story, where the guy falls in love with the girl and they get married and have eighty six children. John Green is an amazing author and I  recommend this book, to anyone thirteen years old and up. It does have a couple words of profanity. But, other than that it was phenomenal. Written by Chanel, 7th grade"
5," loved this book. This book has became a standard for rating other books. I think of this so highly and I'm deeply anticipating the movie.The pros of this book:1. The writing style of John Green. The way he described the characters, let alone the way he portrays Hazel's thoughts are humorous and witty, something that I enjoy greatly.2. Although this book is recommended for young adults, I feel like this book could be read by just about anyone who can understand the wit.3. Augustus Waters. This boy is just the most amazing thing. He knows how Hazel is feeling. He knows Hazel's standpoint on dating. But that boy perseveres!4. Hazel Grace. Hazel, Hazel, Hazel. She's so pessimistically optimistic in ways that almost anyone can relate to, especially young adults. As the heroine of the story plot, she shows weaknesses that I enjoy seeing in books. Many books portray heroines as strong, perfect, happy-go-lucky. Not this. This book is so utterly real with her weaknesses, we can almost touch them. Amazing.I would go on with the pro list but I don't think anyone has time for that.The cons:1. The one and only con about this book is that you'll stay awake not only during the reading process, but much afterwards. This book caused me to think of so many questions about how I would spend my life and about who I would spend it with. This book makes me wanna cuddle up with a puppy and hot chocolate, pop in a Nicholas Sparks movie, and surround myself with boxes and boxes and boxes of tissues.John Green, well done. I've become a believer, therefore a nerdfighter."
5," This is the best book that I have ever read. It was amazing, and a beautiful love story. Of course, I cried so hard that I thought that I would never stop crying. (Spoiler alert) when Augustus died, I felt like someone ripped out my heart, threw it on the ground, had it shattered in pieces, danced on it, then threw it in a fire. I fell in love with Augustus from the beginning, and I will never stop loving him. He is my dream lover, and of course, no one will ever meet my expectations of a man because I want someone exactly like Augustus (without having them die). John Green, I don't know how you made such a perfect boy. I really wish that hazel fell in love with him way before Amsterdam, so they could have more time to be a couple. I would also love it if you DID NOT KILL AUGUSTUS WATERS. That was the most depressing death ever. I will never cry like that again. I will be seeing the movie tomorrow, and I am prepared with two boxes of tissues. I will also read the book again until the part when Augustus tells hazel that he is going to die, and then I will stop reading so that I will not be depressed for a really long time like I was when I finished this book. Thank you for giving me this amazing gift, and the knowledge of what true love is. You have truly changed my life forever. Thanks John green! Ps. Thank you so much for having ansel elgort play Augustus waters. He is seriously the perfect Gus. He is exactly what I imagined Gus to be. Pps. I really would have liked it if my friends hadn't spoiled that Augustus dies, so that I could have enjoyed the book more. Anyways, READ THIS BOOK!!! It is amazing, and life changing"
5," absolutely loved everything about this book. From the first word to the last, I was completely engrossed. I could not put it down. This book is one of the best I have ever read and I intend on reading it at least a dozen more times."
5," This book shared the story from a unique perspective. It was sweet, sad and intelligent. I will keep this and read it again and again. I highly recommend this book for anyone who has ever experienced the loss of someone close to them."
5, The combination of raw and tender emotions make this book a masterpiece depiction of the struggles of doomed teenagers. Green' s frank writing style created what can easily be called on of the greatest literary works I have ever read.
2," (Review first published at Goodreads by myself)Read from December 24th, 2014 to January 15th, 2015, with a break.tl;dr-version of the review: Life sucks and then you die!Christmas 2014 and I thought I could read something more significant as usual, like something deep.This has been made into the movie and the Blu-ray is waiting to be seen in my cupboard, which I plan to do before the end of this year after reading the book.Due to a good deal and because I wanted to try it, I bought the book both in the ebook-Kindle-version and in audio-version, hoping Whispersync will work good.First surprise, Whispersync does not work between iTunes and Kindle. Ok, not totally unexpected.Actually while the books could certainly be described as deep, it is also kind of uplifting and funny, despite the gloom matter.Did not make it, took a break from reading the book and so did not see the film (added January 03d, 2015).Five books, then I pulled myself together and finished it.Actually the surprise was, everyone dies (no, this is no spoiler, you knew that right from the beginning, life it is, not the book).A few twists and a book-story within the book.So, funny little book, which might make some people cry, due to the subject matter, but actually: so what? That's life for you, only for some the time period till dying is shorter and more painful.If you like this, I suggest reading Fight Club, these books are very similar, especially when you consider the underlying themes and not the obvious surface.Solid 5star, I hope the Movie is as good. Highly recommended."
5," This summer for my summer reading project I read The Fault in Our Stars. The Fault In Our Stars is about a sixteen year old girl named Hazel. In this book Hazel has lung cancer. Hazel was going through depression, so her doctor had to change her medicine, and insisted she join a weekly support group. Although she dreaded it her mom made her go. Then one day a boy came into support group for a visit, his name was Augustus Waters. Augustus was a close friend of Isaac. Isaac had a cancer in his eyes, he attended support group once a week, just like Hazel. Augustus and Hazel noticed each other pretty quickly. After a while Augustus and Hazel became closer. There was an organization that the genies granted one wish for people that had illness' one wish. Hazel had used her only wish when she was little, which she regretted, because she wanted to go to Amsterdam to see her favorite writer Peter Van Houten, which was her dream. Augustus knew that Hazel had used her wish, and that she would do almost anything to go to Amsterdam. It turned out that Augustus didn't use wish. Augustus went to go see Hazel; he wanted to use his wish on her, to take her to Amsterdam. Hazel made sure that was what he wanted to do, he was sure. So the genies granted the wish. Her doctors said that she couldn't go, that it was too risky. Hazel was devastated. Then finally the doctors said that she should live her life and go, so that's what she did.I would highly recommend this book for anyone that's mature enough. This is now one of my favorite books! I hope everyone gets a chance read this romantic, sad, inspiring, powerful book!"
5," You know somebody will die at the end of The Fault in Our Stars because the protagonists, 17-year-old Augustus and 16-year-old Hazel, meet in a cancer support group in the basement of an Episcopal church in Indianapolis. So this book is about the telling, not the tale. John Green creates smart, funny, irreverent characters who squeeze every bit of life--love, joy, pain and regret--out of the small infinity they have left.To respond briefly to some criticisms I've read:(1) The teenagers don't speak like real teenagers; they are too witty and their vocabularies too advanced. Maybe not the teenagers where you live or go to school, but I've met teenagers like Hazel and Augustus who are far more cerebral than average. It's a book, not real life. If authors wrote dialogue exactly as real people speak it, it would be intolerably banal and boring.(2) The parents are poorly developed. A 16-year-old with cancer narrates the story. Most children and teenagers see their parents strictly in terms of how the parents relate to themselves, not as fully-rounded people with lives of their own. Hazel and Augustus show more concern and respect for their parents than a lot of teenagers.I loved this book. It's well-written. Despite its tear-jerky subject, it avoids mawkish sentimentality. (I did not cry, and I am, I am deeply ashamed to say, easy prey to mawkish sentimentality.)  Though a quick read, it's got a lot to say about what's important, why life matters, and what might or might not lie beyond. I hope I can convince my kid to read it. He thinks it's just for girls."
5, The romance between Augustus and Hazel was remarkable. That was true love...  By the end of this book I was sobbing. I highly recommend this book because I feel it so accurately portrays the life of someone with cancer. Please read!
5," Cliche time!!!! I laughed, i cried, i felt sorry, this book made me think of things i never thought of before and taught me so much about life, and im only 11. This book will forever hold a special place in my heart, which it warmed."
5," John Green really has a way with words, depicting true emotion. He doesn't write fairy tales, but acknowledges that this world isn't a wish-granting factory. Well written, worth the time, and a beautiful star-crossed story."
5,"f you're looking for a book to make you laugh, smile, and cry-this is it! I've never felt so many emotions in one book. John Green knows how to tug at your heart strings. This book shows readers what it's like to truly love someone."
5," The book is basically about two teens dealing with cancer.  The main characters try to sound like adults but they wind up sounding like no adult or teen that I've ever known.  It's a sweet story though, and I read it within 24 hours."
5," What a fantastic book for teenagers and parents alike! My grandaughter asked me to read this book and I am so glad that I did, that I even passed it on to my mother who is 84 to read. Excellent. Makes you think and discuss the topic!"
5," loved that the main characters were teenagers, yet the dialogue and subject matter remained quite mature. I cried quite a bit through the last several chapters, but despite  the momentary depression I thoroughly enjoyed  this book."
2," This novel was gripping in all the right ways...especially emotionally &amp; mentally.  The story of love found even in the darkest of circumstances was not only inspiring, but achingly true.  This is a novel to read over and over again."
5, This book is amazing. It makes me appreciate life that much more. Today will forever shape our tomorrows. Live free and enjoy every minute. There are no real faults in our stars. Be happy. Read. Fall in love with this novel as I did.
5," This book heped me to understand that sometimes our fate is faulted and we dont get what we wanted. I'm now enjoying the time I spend with the ones I love instead of dreading what's ahead, becasue we don't know if our time is up yet."
5," This book is fantastic!  I love, love, love the main characters.  I cannot praise this book enough.  I couldn't put it down.  It's so smart and funny while still being incredibly sad.  Hours later I am still tearing up.  Just buy it!"
5," How do writers speak for each of their characters--it's as though they ARE those people.  How else can they give voice to their characters' words, much less their thoughts.  If so, Mr. Green must suffer along with them as they struggle.  To me, it seems that Peter's destruction of self stemmed primarily from the fact that he lied to his dying daughter in telling her he would join her soon, and yet he had gone on living for over 20 years.  He went on living, although eventually he had nobody but his ruined self to live for.  I understand how that feels, having said that very thing to a beautiful five-year-old girl dying with neuroblastoma during the e last minute of her life on earth, 35 years ago.  The difference--other children other people to live for.  No choice but to stay, yet that lie and the hope in her eyes when I made that false promise haunt me to this day.  Good story, Mr. Green, and of course I would recommend this book to my adult friends, the ones mature enough to bear it.  So many astute observances, such accurate reflections of the agony of losing a loved one, and being the suffering loved one who knows they will be lost.  When our little one was four, she looked at me from her hospital bed and said, with the intent to comfort me, We all die, you know.  She said that so softly and gently.  Some readers will probably think the young people in your book would not be grownup enough to think the thoughts they did, but I know that when a child knows he or she is dying, their maturity level grows in leaps and bounds.  Every character in this book rang true to me, that's how well written it is."
5," am not ashamed to admit that, as an adult, I loved this book and would recommend it to just about ANYONE.  I read plenty of books, good ones, great ones in fact and this is pretty high up on the list.  John Green is starting to become one of my favorite authors.  Many people say the two main characters are not believable teenagers, and I would definitely challenge that.  These are supposedly two kids fighting cancer, around plenty of adult who have high reading levels.  That makes them wholly believable and witty and lovable on the same sarcastically awesome level as Juno.  I think that this book is the perfect read for the modern teen and provides many insights far beyond the teenaged years.  It's not just a teen story, or a love story, or a cheesy cancer story, it transcends all of that to a story that is just deeply human.The story of two teenagers trying to navigate their short lives and make them meaningful to each other can be easily turned into something that's been done before.  John Green makes that story something special and adds his unique insight.  He brings us into their world, in which very few adults can remember exactly when THEY were there exactly (how it felt, what was said etc) but it makes you relive that moment through these two wonderful characters.  The small adventure that these two live makes it a very big adventure for two kids who may never become adults.  As I've said before I believe that John Green is the new (and better) J.D. Salinger, and this is what teenagers should be reading in their junior years of high school because it's modern and meaningful."
5, This was an absolutely amazing book. The characters were perfectly described and you come to love all of them throughout the course of the story. You will laugh out loud at many things but you will also cry. JOB WELL DONE JOHN GREEN
5," Do you have tissues?  Yeah, you'd better stock up if you're gonna read this book.  I'm not the typical demographic for young adult literature, but wow.  Just...wow.  Emotional, Powerful, and told in a way that you can't put it down."
5, have always wanted to read this book when I finally got the chance I absorbed every bit it. The thought of what it is like to live with cancer or anything like it intrigued me. This book answered all my questions.Jess age 12
5," This story in essence is about a very touchy, sad subject. That being the case, John Green, a brilliant man turns it into a story that leaves one yearning to turn each page, even if the long hours of the night approach them. Amazing"
2, BEAUTIFUL story .. well written .. read it in one sitting .. captivates you from page one .. illness is part of living - let's you walk in the shoes of teenagers wanting to be NORMAL .. not defined by a disease .. LOVED this book !!
5," Quite simply one of the most beautiful books I've ever read. I bought the book simply because I really enjoy John and Hank Green's web series, but man did I get more than I bargained for. Truly moving, truly great, it was fantastic."
5," “So dawn goes down to day, the poet wrote. Nothing gold can stay”.It is said that if you learn to accept rather than expect, you will have fewer disappointments. But I guess, it is human nature to expect. I had huge expectations of this book after the overwhelming amount of reviews, and the generous ratings it received. However, if I had to describe my thoughts about this book in a nutshell, it would be: Great Expectations + Average Reality = Huge Disappointment.Let me start with the positives.This book gave me a peek into the world of kids/teens who are battling disease. I had not read anything like this before, and it was part of the reason I picked this book.  What I particularly liked was that despite the fact that the main protagonists are suffering from cancer, it is not just another Cancer Book. It is so much more. There are some really great thoughts expressed in a very beautiful way. It’s also engaging and well-written.A concern that a lot of people seem to have with this book is that Hazel &amp; Augustus (the main protagonists) do not speak like teenagers. I tend to agree. They think and act like teens. They just don’t speak like teens. The counter argument is that they are simply smarter than the average teen. However, I don’t think this has anything to do with being “smart”. Yeah, they are smart kids, they’ve been through a lot, and they’ve had to grow up fast. And while they are both smart, smart doesn’t necessarily mean speaking like a Yale literature major.Read the full review @ http://shanayatales.com/the-fault-in-our-stars-by-john-green-book-review/"
5," purchased this book as a gift for a friend(Hardcover copy) and Amazon delivered it two days earlier than expected. I could not be any happier with my purchase. This goes to show how great this retailer is when it comes to purchasing books. Now here is the review.If you like slice of life stories that are heartwarming and feel-good then this book is for you. It makes you look at life in a whole another perspective and puts you in the shoes of a girl named Hazel Grace who is suffering from terminal cancer. Her mother encourages her to attend cancer coping sessions with other people of her age with cancer where she meets a handsome boy by the name of Augustus Waters. They soon fall in love both fighting the disease that may one day tear them apart. The story is an emotional roller coaster that will make you cry, laugh, get angry, and make you feel as if you are really watching an Oscar Winning movie. The two characters are easy to fall in love with because they are witty and absolutely adorable. You will not be able to put this book down so be warned.If you are considering whether to get the audiobook or not, I say GO FOR IT! I found the narrator to be quite excellent in conveying the emotions of the characters. She does a brilliant job keeping the characters alive. I really felt like I was hearing the voice of Hazel coming through her. In fact I found the audiobook to be as good as the book itself, if not better. Whether you choose to get the audiobook or not, The Fault In Our Stars is one of the best books written in years and I thank John Greene for writing this amazing story."
3," The book, The Fault In Our Stars, by John Green, is an incredible story about 2 people fighting cancer who learn to love. However, this book is more of a coming age and a romance book, rather then a typical cancer book. The main character, Hazel Grace Lancaster, is a stage 4 cancer patient and lives a very boring antisocial life, unlike the other main character Augustus Waters, who lives an eventful life and plans on enjoying every minute his life while he has it. Unlike Hazel, Augustus used to have cancer but is now in remission. They meet in a cancer support group and sparks fly. Hazel try's to keep to herself, but Augustus, based on his personality, jumps straight in and starts flirting. They become great friends once Hazel makes Augustus (Gus) read the book An Imperial Affliction. After reading this book they go to Amsterdam to meet the author, Peter Van Houten. Sadly, on this trip Hazel learns that Augustus's remission did not last and he once again has stage 4 cancer, This book has a tragic end, but truly shows the meaning of true love. When going into reading this book, I was not expecting the ending. I don't want to give it away, but I was truly shocked by the ending. It is one of those endings that you can't stop thinking about. It just sits their and lingers in you mind. However, in the overall this was a fantastic book. Yes, it is very sad, but it touches your heart and keeps you interested in the book. The author gives great detail and keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time. This is definitely one of my favorite books, and I would highly recommend it to all readers!"
5, Great story but not one you want to read when others are around.  Well written and although it is apparently written for teens I can't think of any reason why an adult would not enjoy it. Just make sure you have your kleenex handy.
5,m an English teacher and I read this book to make sure it was appropriate for my middle schoolers.  I recommended it to them because it was a great story.  The buzz that has been created in my classroom over this book is amazing.
5," loved the fault in our stars a lot, but the end where he's really sick was way too sad and went on for too long. The rest of it was amazing! I like in John Green book's he adds sentences that are kind of like poetry. A must read!"
5," Excellent book. Very well written. Quick read, but we'll worth it. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, after having a family member pass from cancer recently, I appreciated the perspective of this dark subject matter. It was beautiful."
5, LOVE THIS BOOK! I have never cried so hard on a book. You can get so involved with Hazel and Augustus. You understand their relationship. You feel like a part of their relationship. I'm in love. I really hope there's a movie. Lol
2," Few modern YA writers can weave prose like John Green. His style is effortless, his characters immensely relatable, and the questions he raises incredibly thoughtful. Prepare to have your heart torn out and put back together again."
5, Can't go wrong with John Green as the author.  This is an awesome book; written about Indiana (the Castleton area).Book: 5 stars (I'd give higher if I could). This book arrived in excellent condition and before date promised.
5," fell in love with the characters in the first chapter and from then on, I couldn't put this book down! John Green is an incredible author!!! I definitely recommend this book to everyone who loves to laugh, cry, and be inspired!!!"
5," This is an excellent read from a uniquely teenage perspective. Even though I cried through the last half , I highly recommend it. 5 stars for accurate portrayal of the struggle to keep laughing and loving while life is left to live"
5,"f you are a fan of Catcher in the Rye or Perks of Being a Wallflower, then this book is a must read.  I couldn't put it down and for a book about cancer, it was extremely funny, honest and entertaining (and of course sad as well)."
5," Between Looking for Alaska, Paper Towns, and Will Grayson Will Grayson I've read a few works by John Green. None of them made me cry so hard, or laugh so loud. In a beautiful tale of loss, he teaches us all a few things about life."
5," TFIOS was not quite the teen book I had expected. I knew from the synopsis and movie trailers that it was not a light hearted love story but was slightly surprised at the path this story took. It had moments of well thought out text and dialogue and then others times where I felt the need to keep truckin on and not give up on it yet. Somewhat sporadic and random at times but the characters were each fleshed out decently enough that it kept me on a small tether.Hazel was unique to say the least and certainly not like any teenager I've ever met but, it's also fiction so then again, if this was written with current teen angst and behaviors in mind, I would have abandoned it long ago. Augustus was cut from a different cloth as well but in his character development I found myself enjoying his journey a tad more and wishing I'd be given more of him. Of course my mind's eye envisioned the faces that have been on all of the movie promo material so I can't say whether or not I agree with casting choices.And honestly...who cares.After completing this in a few days I can certainly see the hype and excitement behind it and I am curious to see how this has been adapted for the screen. My only thought after I finished the final page was whether or not my daughter (then 12) should have read this heavy worded book at her age in 2012. This is not for the younger tweens, in my opinion, as most of the vocabulary and dialogue have the potential to be misunderstood. But honestly...I mostly read this for the teenager under our roof that will, undoubtedly, ask to see the film soon."
5," ~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars / But in ourselves. Easy enough to say when you're a Roman nobleman (or Shakespeare!), but there is no shortage of fault to be found amid our stars.Rarely does a book make me cry.Rarely does an emotional book make me laugh.Rarely does a book make me laugh one minute and cry the next.This story contains beautiful, philosophical prose which will ingrain your thoughts, hurt your heart, and still manages to fill you with love.This book is one of the reasons I adore reading. A book that can convey emotions intensely that I fiercely feel I'm actually going through what the book characters are enduring. Profound and personal thoughts told by a book character can sweep you away in love, can break your heart in pain, can make you ecstatic in laughter.This is not an easy subject to write or read, but the author has written a lovely, touching and highly unique story with remarkable characters. Told in a comical yet heartbreaking story, this author makes me think about real-life people who go through this. It made me admire them even more, it made me think about how momentary life can be, how everything can change quickly, and how adaptable we are. In the midst of unfortunate circumstances a one of a kind love story is told, and most of all a story about how we should cherish life always. Okay?We made the story funny. You have a choice in this world, I believe, about how to tell sad stories, and we made the funny choice."
3," For bookworms everywhere, John Green’s bestselling novel, The Fault in Our Stars, has been captivating readers just by the first page. Sixteen year old teen, Hazel Grace, with terminal thyroid cancer meets another cancer survivor teen, Augustus Waters, at a young support group. The two star-crossed lovers learn from each other about living every single day to the fullest when life can be so short. Green’s most popular novel is guaranteed to make readers laugh, cry, and fall in love with the two teens as they go on this journey together. So far, out of all of his other books, The Fault in Our Stars has had the highest amount of sales.Since I have read other of Green’s works, I am familiar with the style of his writing. Unlike his other novels, such as Looking for Alaska and Paper Towns, the author reaches out of his comfort zone in his fourth and most popular novel. Just like the majority of Nicholas Spark’s heart wrenching novels, Green happens to incorporate a common theme throughout all of his books. A nerdy guy, who usually happens to be the narrator, befriends a gorgeous and sharp girl out of his league. He ties it all together by adding teen romance and a taste of tragedy. I was surprised to see that Green was writing about delicate material.I highly recommend for those who may have not raved about his other books, to give Green another chance and take the time to read The Fault in Our Stars. I can guarantee that the author’s growth in his fourth novel will not only impress you, but make you fall in love with the characters and their journey throughout the story."
5," John Green begins The Fault in Our Stars with an author's note, where he reminds the reader that the book is a work of fiction, and not based on actual events. He reminds us that there is no need to try to identify any actual events, because so doing would fail to properly value the power which fiction can have. This is a good reminder for us, as readers, because John Green introduces us first to Hazel and then Augustus, who quickly bond over a book, An Imperial Affliction.What Mr. Green essentially creates are several books. Through the quotes and discussions of the characters in The Fault in Our Stars, it is possible to figure out large portions of An Imperial Affliction. This second book, which Hazel and Augustus read, allows the author to bring in additional viewpoints concerning loss and death - or perhaps just death, and loss as a side effect of death. These two young people strive to find out what happened to the characters after the end of the book they had read. This need to know what happens after the end of a book is easily symbolic of the need to know what happens after the end of life - a question one can understand coming from a young man and woman, each with various stages of cancer.At its simplest, the book is about all those topics one would expect from the genre. It is a story of love and life; a story of illness, of pain, fear, death, and loss. Yet, it is, at the same time, a commentary on literature and the power of fiction. A power which any reader of A Fault in Our Stars is sure to understand. It is a roller coaster that only goes up."
2," This is an easy read and a compelling story worth your time. John Green's distinct voice comes out in full force, meaning everyone is unrealistically clever and John Greenish, but the prose is so catching that you won't care much."
5," Though this book was slightly predictable and typical, it was beautifully written. It had me in tears from about page 250 until I reached 321, the end. A beautiful love story full of hope and laughter. Can't wait to see the movie!"
4,t was interesting to see terminal illness beneath the surface layer that the community creates around the person. I would highly recommend to anyone who knows of people and children struggling with cancer (so basically everyone).
5, love it! One of the best books i ever read. I will definitely recommend it. This book made me cry and laughed as crazy. I Like John Green description of certain things that could be cruel but he made them funny at the same time.
5," was hooked from the first page.  While the story is sad, it is beautifully written.  Love the people.  Of course I cried but this is a must read.  I finished the book last Saturday and I still think about it every day."
5," haven't read a book so intellectual, so perfectly worded and pictured, in a very, very long time. Touching on societies views of death, it's made me question my own thoughts and morals. There's more and less that we can all do.."
5," This book was epically amazing. Quite a tear jerker but also makes you reevaluate life and look at it from a different perspective. I fell in love with it, its characters, and its story. This story takes life to a whole new level."
5," could be wrong, but I find it a little hard to believe. Not the cancer part, or anything to do with the story line, really, but the two characters themselves. You have two people who met in a support group, and they just happened to be the same age (cool) and are fond of reading (as many of us are). But the similarities don't end there. They are both ridiculously smart, smarter than anyone I know anyway. They're both smart-asses too and use a lot of sarcasm. And it's not just them, their friend Isaac is smart and sarcastic all the time as well. I could have believed how similar they all seemed if they met in a literary class or something, but for three ridiculously intelligent, well versed people to meet in a local support group seems a little far-fetched.I'm not saying the author should have dumbed down his characters, but their personalities were so much a like I started to find it annoying. By the end it's like they were sharing the same thoughts and they hadn't even known each other that long.One other thing that stood out was the he said/she said. This is just preference for writers' but personally I like a little variety. It got redundant after awhile. Okay, he said. Okay, I said. Okay, he said again. And so on and so forth. Just made it a little hard to read at some points.So other than those two issues, the book was really good. Would I ever re-read it? No, probably not. The ending was great, well done. In fact, the way it ended was probably the best part. I definitely recommend the book to anyone considering it."
5, another amazing book by John Green. I couldn't put it down! So many lines in here I want to go back and highlight so I can remember them forever.  Great quotes in here and amazing writing.  I love this book and all of his others!
5," One of the best, most touching books I've read in a long time. Having known to many people with cancer, I appreciated the first person asking of what is like to live with it. And Hazel and Augustus will stick with me a long time."
2," normally don't like tear-jerkers and I rarely like love stories, but I loved this novel that was both. The charaters are sympathetic and the plot-line is unpredictable enough to keep you surprised. I highly recommend this book."
5," This book is written for young adults.  I am a pretty old adult, and I thought it was wonderful.  It is a story about a very sad situation without being the least bit sappy.  There is a reason there are 1 million copies in print."
5," didn't think this book would be worth the stars but it is. Honestly one of the saddest books I have ever read but we both such a great message. A reminder to hold our kids tighter, think a little harder and cherish the moments."
5, A wonderful telling of a story that seems impossible to tell. John Green tells the story of the heartbreak involved in cancer in a way that has never been done before. This book is a roller coaster that will leave you breathless.
5, This book is so wonderful. I love the way that it is written. I feel as though Hazel is right in front of me talking and describing her world. I would suggest anyone to read this book. Spoil alert: it's definitely a tear jerker.
5," One of the most well-written books I've read in the last several years. Achingly beautiful. Perfect character development. As artfully constructed as a whiskey &amp; water, only the water is really just the abstracted idea of water."
5, This book was amazing. It wasn't just a sad book about a girl with cancer. It was a great novel about a true love story. I have never read a book like this one.  This is my new favorite book. I hope you choose to read this book!
5, like that the story of their normal lives was made to seem different but also quite similar to the average sixteen year olds day. Also the way the two fell in love was a bit cheesy but good because it was meant to be that way.
5," Great for adults as wells as teens.  Very thought-provoking and written with language used today.  John Green brings you in and you can't put it down.  It's also great to get to know the author on YouTube, what a great person!!!"
5," really enjoyed this book, even though it was quite sad and intense at times.deals with several delicate and sensitive themes* in a thoughtful, humorous, insightful manner.*cancer, adolescence...loss/grief and death"
2," had heard about this from numerous friends and reviews in magazines. I was a bit worried since it's young adult, and also knowing that it would be a sad story. I really enjoyed this book and will be reading more by John Green."
5," From start to finish, it is perfect. With all the crap people seem to love nowadays I was wary; but, this book took my breathe away. Dignified and fully developed characters &amp; beautifully, well constructed prose -I feel in love."
5," As a 30 year old male I was afraid before ordering this that it was going to be twilight meets cancer kids.  It was not.  This is a great book, and a very fun read. Sure its about kids, but I feel all ages can enjoy the story."
5," decided that it was time to read this book after hearing so many things about it for so long. Since I had plans to go and see the movie adaptation, I finally bought the book to read it before.It’s been a while that a book nearly brought me to tears. I had to take breaks at some key scenes to bring my breathing back to normal. It’s that powerful.At first, I wasn’t sure I’d love it so much because the writing is very unique, but it’s so fitting to the characters! The humor is wonderful, the plot is amazing, the characters are strong, flawed, down to earth and yet they have that youth that only brings more life to this story.This story broke my heart and I know it’s one I will remember for a long time. A very long time.Everything felt true, resonating inside of me to better grab me and push me into Hazel and Gus’ story and all the characters seconding them. It’s sweet, strong and also hopeful. I know, it’s quite weird since this story is so sad, since there’s no miracle, but somehow these characters are showing something to me, something that makes me think of hope. As crazy as it sounds.I was never bored throughout the book. In every chapters there are many key scenes, something that would give even more dimension to the characters and that grabbed me, making my heart beats some more either painfully or sweetly.It was easy to relate to Hazel, or at least it was to me, and it made it all the more moving. I couldn’t put any distance and I experienced that story full force.It’s one of a kind book."
5," just finished this outstanding book. Two things: I literally couldn't contain my emotions as evidenced by the mountain of kleenex amassed at my feet; my family now has confirmation that I am a certifiable nutcase as I laughed and sobbed through this book. It is brilliantly poignant, clever, intelligent, profound, WONDERFUL in every word &amp; action.The MCs are too perfect for words. Hazel Grace is amazing &amp; amazing to love. Augustus, oh Augustus, there are not enough words to convey the loveliness of his soul. EVERY girl should be so lucky to have an Augustus in her life, fleeting or forever. He should be the yardstick by which all boys are measured. Their love was beautiful, heartbreaking, &amp; inspirational.John Green's writing is Perfection. I read the book on a recommendation from a friend. I probably would not have picked it up otherwise because it just sounded, quite frankly, so depressing. Two cancer kids fall in love? Yikes, give me a root canal instead! I'm so glad I read it anyway. It's such a beautiful story w/ unforgettable, worship-worthy characters. I LOVED how smart, &amp; smart-alecky, they were. Not just Hazel &amp; Augustus, but also Isaac, the Lancasters, Peter (so despicable, yet a sympathetic character by the end), all of them. They were genuine in all of their humanness.I am so envious of John Green. What must it feel like to be able to string together HIS words into these sentences into these paragraphs into these pages into this remarkable book??This is my first JG book. Won't be my last. Highly highly recommend."
4," really enjoyed this book. It is more of a teen read, but as a 30 something I found the story touched my heart all the same. It was a quick read with a few laughs and a few good sobbing moments. I would recommend it to anyone."
5," laughed and I cried, but it was still a beautiful love story! I recommend this book to whoever likes love stories! This was a fantastic book! I had to read it before the I go see the movie, and I read it in les than 2 days :)"
4,"ve read reviews and sample from amazon and it's my fault. I knew its going to be juvenile and it is. While the plot and storyline is clear, it's just way too one dimensional for me. Not much character-conflict. Too easy read."
5," The first book in years that I have already read twice.  I am not a weeping kind of woman, but I truly wept.,  Thank you for agood read, words of wisdom, lots of laughs from intellectual wit, and heart-touching emotions ."
5, This book is amazing because it made me feel like this is a real person going through this and not oh a fake story about someone. It also gave me a different outlook on things in life. I recommend it and it brought me to tears.
2, You felt it .. you feel it.. you see it and you think twice and remember the angst of youth and realise how pathetic our adult troubles can be when faced with death at your door when you are young.read with hot chocolate.
5, loved this book. Amazing. A sadly great story. I laughed andCried laughed some more and cried even more.  Amazing.  It's so hard to explain all the feelings you go through reading this book. You just have to read it!!!!
5," this book was an incredible novel bordering on literature. the unanswerable questions that aren't often asked are to be found within this novel, and i was genuinely moved to tears in one moment and laughing my head off the next"
5," honestly bought this book based on the cover and the good reviews. I had no idea what it was about. I loved it! It was so wonderfully written, and despite its sad contents, I finished the book feeling happy. A wonderful read!"
5," This book was moving, entertaining, engaging; in short, it was hard to put down.  The author made you care about the characters and not just because they have cancer.  I am looking forward to reading other works by this author."
5," was hesitant to read this book at all; I'm 65 years old and thought this book might be more of a read for a younger person since it is about teenagers. I also wasn't sure that a story involving teens with cancer could possibly be uplifting in any way and did I want to go down that road. I'm glad that I decided to read it and see what all the hype was about.  The story opens with a very handsome young man staring at Hazel Grace during a support group meeting for cancer patients. Hazel has an incurable cancer and needs to take her oxygen tank (whom she has named Philip) with her everywhere. The young man who is staring is named Augustus and he also has cancer, but is in remission. Augustus has a best friend, Isaac, who has lost an eye to cancer and is going blind in the other eye. These three strike up a relationship, which down the road becomes more for Hazel and Augustus. This is not a sad story but a strong story about finding joy in what these kids have in the here-and-now. Acceptance of their future - or lack thereof - is something that the families have to come to terms with and the stars of the story do it with such grace that you would expect nothing less from these characters. As you read and get to know them, you find such strength in each of them and totally begin to get a different perspective of death. I found great beauty in their love story in spite of the horrible ups and downs that they incurred. I wouldn't call them brave...I wouldn't call them optimists...I would say that they knew how to make time count  with no regrets. Thoroughly enjoyed the story."
5," have to admit the only reason I started reading this book in the first place was because the attention it has received lately. It wasn’t the type of funny romantic novel I would typically go for and I wasn’t really into sad nostalgic novels but I decided to give it a try. To be honest, I love the book, but I still feel it was a bit overrated. I read it before the movie was in theatres so I had very high hopes for the movie, having saw the trailer it seems amazing. First of all, I have to compliment John Green. His written work in The Fault in our Stars is phenomenal. He uses a lot of metaphors and motifs in this book to portray and explore the character’s feelings. But honestly speaking, a dictionary was an essential tool for me throughout this book, there were a decent bunch of vocabulary that may be too complex for young teenagers to grasp, or maybe it was just me.The plot was focused on the life of Hazel Grace, her battle with cancer and especially her romance with a fellow cancer patient, Augustus. I love the romantic development between Hazel and Augustus and their struggle in a daily life basis and what they would give to have a normal teenage life. I love how John includes their little dream journey to Amsterdam to seek out the answer to Hazel’s favourite book, An Imperial Affliction, which remains a mystery to Hazel. Towards the end of the book, John adds a shocking incident which brings readers to tears. I must admit I was pretty much like other girls while reading this book, I laughed, giggled and for most of the time I was holding my tears in."
5," Typically, I'm not one for books about cancer. This one was different. It lacked the cheesy predictable story lines. It was brutally honest, and beautiful. So easy to relate to and quite the page turner as well as tear jerked."
3, Loved this book.  My son and I are both cancer survivors so this really struck a chord with me.  The description of how young lives are lived while in treatment was so accurate and heartbreaking.  I highly recommend this book.
5," As anyone can tell you this book is absolutely amazing--heart-wrenching, hilarious, romantic, thought-provoking--you'll feel all the feels with this book. John Green is a crazy talented author and this book is his masterpiece."
2, Beautifully written book. It's not your average sad story about cancer patients. If you have lost someone to this heart breaking disease it will help you see things through their eyes.I couldn't put this book down.
5, All my friends told me how much they loved this book so I decided to read this book too. I loved it so much! It couldn't have been better if they tried. Although it was seriously emotional it was still like the best book ever!
5," have Never written a book review - but I just wanted to say gird your loins and read this book. It is worth your time and the money you will spend on Kleenex. Augustus &amp; Hazel, much like the universe, deserve your attention."
5,"ts so magical the characters come alive and  you really learn to love them. It creates this little window of how its like to have cancer. With my vague description it still sounds like a wonderful book and quite truly, it is."
5," haven't read a book with this much heart since the author's debut novel, Looking for Alaska. Green may write for teenagers, but his book are better writtern than half the books I've read that were meant for adults."
5,"d recommend this book to anyone. It made me laugh, and cry, to the point I think my family thought I was going mad, but  I enjoyed every moment of it. It's extremely touching and lovely, I haven't a bad word to say about it."
5," got this book for my 17 year old daughter and she raved so much about it, I had to read it!It had great characters who made you root for them and really understand from their point of view what they were going through."
5, This was one of the most beautiful novels I've ever read.  It was poetic and unique and said so many truths about life in a way that was not even remotely precious or cliched.  John Green is a genius.  You must read this book.
5," Because of all reviews across Internet, I had expected to cry a lot. But, it didn't hit me to the level, I had been anticipating.What I like----------------------[The characters, of course.] I like how the writer portrayed them in sort of unique tone which might be new things only to those who never have deep involvement with Cancer and not that strange to those Cancer survivors.[Book-ception.] I like how the writer buried a book in his book making it more realistic to readers. That writer from Dutch added a funky colour to this novel with pleasant twist.[Frankness.] I'm not sure if frankness in this book is bold enough to westerners but for an Asian like me born in a very conservative country (Myanmar aka Burma), I like how the characters talked about death, sometimes with faint tone of humour. I like how he illustrated the book in a way to stop us from assuming all Cancer patients or survivors are heroes. It's quite strange that it made me understand it might be natural sentiment to cancer teens.What I don't like---------------------------------[Lack of Twist.] The writer just put a gun on wall and fired it later. Not many things we didn't expect ooccurred. I like a book when it shows me something I totally didn't hope would happened happened.[Long text between ending and real ending.] The last letter was great yet I wasn't happy since the ending ( the exact thing happened to character(s)) and last word of the book had quite a number of pages. But then, it is just personal taste."
5," Ok ok I am not going to go into to much details about This amazing book because I think everybody knows what this book is about. But I will tell you all the truth TFIOS caught me why off guard I really did't think I was going to love this book so much as I do now. Let me start from the beginning I was really procrastinating to read TFIOS for some time when I got it out of the library, because I read Looking For Alaska first by John Green and I think that was a big mistake to start that book first. I am not say Looking For Alaska was not a good book it really was a good book but it was not my favorite book by John Green. I really did enjoy the plot and the story of Looking of Alaska I just didn't care for the main characters of it which kind of bummed me out just a little bit but I really did enjoy the book over all. So that's why I was really procrastinating and took some time to when I finally read TFIOS and Ohh boy when I finally read it I was hooked line and sinker. The hype for TFIOS is so true this book was a really beautiful heartbroken story that I could not put this book down at all that I finished it in two days. I just loved everything in TFIOS especially the characters. My heart just hurt for everything they were going through, and I totally understand there personality and they way there were acting towards there friends and family member just heart wrenching. All in all I say TFIOS is one of my favorite books by John Green that I will never forget. Now I most definitely going to try John Green other books out as well. Well Until Next Time My Friends."
2," The Fault in Our Stars, John Green (Dutton Books)beautiful, brutaltumors amongst the tulipshappy ever ‘now’Some books begin with the clear certainty that things won’t end happily ever after, and so it is with John Green’s ‘The Fault in Our Stars’. There’s no secret that this is a love story between two terminally ill teenagers (albeit in remission), but the power and the point of this book is not about the illness. It’s about the possibilities. It’s about living life instead of passing the time.It’s Happy Ever Now.The dialogue between Hazel and her cancer-friends is very John Green-ish. It’s very clever and fast and ironic and insightful. At first I thought it was unrealistic – as unrealistic as anything in fiction can be – but I got used to the rapid-fire observations and commentary. And there’s the fact that both Hazel and Augustus were home-schooled and clearly bookish types, so the language jousts and deep-and-meaningfuls were justified, to me at least.I found the descriptions of illness to be refreshing. Amputees, chemotherapy, drugs and optimism are introduced and taken for what they are in amongst the discussions on life and love and being a teenager. Cancer isn’t a taboo in this book, and neither is death. In fact, the delivery of a pre-funeral towards the end of the book really emphasized the inevitability of such things for everyone. As Hazel notes: funerals are for those who are left behind.I can’t really add anything new to the reviews of this book. It is a phenomenon."
4,"t is not everyday that a few thousand words change a person's life. After reading this book, that is what happened for me. I understand that is truly cliche, but true none the less. This book is a work of art. Many say that it sounds unbelievable and that teenagers do not speak in such fashion. This is simply untrue. One must consider that these particular adolescents have faced the scary thing that goes bump in the night, aka cancer. Therefore already placing them ahead of their peers in mental maturity.It is a simple love story with a few complexities. It happens quite fast. First they become great friends and then fall in love slowly then all at once the quotes you can get from this book are unreal. Such wisdom and beauty.Perhaps my favorite thing about this book was the way it ended. Without giving it away...you receive the closer that is not located in the Peter vanhouten book, An Imperial Infliction. You know from the first page that this book was not going to have your typical HEA. Don't be detoured, you will still enjoy the ending and the simple teenage love.I would recommend this book to any book reader. In fact, I quite frequently do. I own both the ebook and the audio version. I have listened/read them both many times. The story never becomes a bore. Each time I find something I missed previously.I don't think I have ever fallen in love with two characters as much as I love hazel and Augustus.Read it. Listen to it. Go watch it when the movie comes out. It is a grave tragedy that books this wonderful aren't plentiful."
5," This book is a good read- it helps readers think about life beyond themselves as we watch two teens, and their parents, struggle with cancer and sickness. All this in the midst of finding friendship and love. The Author is not very religious and so the story is left a little flat for me, compared to more hopeful books... but it still has it's own kind of hope - in having been loved and remembered by some. I realize that this quality will make it even more attractive to some readers, and there is definitely room in the book for many different kinds of faith (which are portrayed)... I just can't shake my own belief that there is even more to life than the conclusion the teens came to. But, they struggled with more than I currently have, so really, who am I to say?What I loved about it, and something that will stick with me forever, was the idea that your unique love and friendship with someone dies with them. For example... my husband and I share a million inside jokes between each other that no one else would or could ever possibly understand or laugh in the same way we do. I watched as one of the characters struggles at the memorial service for the other because he/she felt people didn't truly understand what they shared together, or who that person actually and truly was. The struggle with death wasn't over-glamorized, yet the book isn't a total downer either. I definitely appreciate the one-of-a-kind love I share with my husband a little more after reading this book, and realize that each relationship I am lucky to have is unique and individual."
5," This is a book that is so worth reading. I can't believe  pre-teens and teen agers finally have a book in which they can learn compassion, love and value without being manipulated. Thank you John Green for such a great write."
4, This book is an amazing read.... I really can't wait to go watch it at the movies. Page turner from the very BEGINNING. This book isn't afraid to spit out the truth of cancer. The most important lesson of this story.... LIVE.
5, Hope you have a heart of steel to not get emotional reading this book I loved it like crazy. Very sad but very good. I would recommend that you stick with it until the very end no matter how sad u are at the end of chapter 21
5, had no idea what this book was about before opening it. I've already read Looking for Alaska and enjoyed it. Thought I would give Fault in our stars  a try too. I'm glad I did and I will recommend it to everyone I know.
5," My 12yr old son gifted this book to me, it made him cry, feel... He wanted to share that with me. I love him for being an open minded enough boy/ man to read this and comfortable in his own skin to acknowledge that in public."
5," Not sure if this book was written for a young audience, but it was severely lacking. The characters were too predictable, the dialogue odd and just not very well written. Disappointing as it was someone's book club selection."
5, This book literally changed my view of life. It made me so emotional and I connected so well with the characters. The words in this book are absolutely gorgeous and I highly recommend it to everyone looking for a great novel.
2," This book taught me how contemporary teens think and talk.  Their wisdom and lack thereof  and compassion were recognized by adults.  While we know how it will end, we kept pulling for these two young people and made us care."
5," THIS WHOLE REVIEW IS FULL OF SPOILERS. DO NOT READ (YOU COULD BE BUYING THE BOOK AND READING IT INSTEAD).......A chock full of spoilers because I have feelings, okay? Okay. (In fact, writing 'okay' made me cry even more).I just finished this and I'm entirely wrecked. The best thing about fiction? You get to meet these wonderful, living people and get to know them and fall in love with them. The worst thing about fiction? You can't reach into that world and, with your magic reader powers of want and hope, make them better again. I can't reach into The Fault in Our Stars and make Augustus Waters well. I can't tell him it'll be okay once I've cured him of his cancer, and I can't tell him he'll live a wonderful and happy and healthy life with his Hazel Grace (I would've cured her too, of course). Instead, he's at a Capital-S Somewhere, not playing basketball (because he hates it anyway). Wherever Capital-S Somewhere is, I hope he has his crooked smile, his charm, his packet of cigarettes, his memories of Amsterdam and, most importantly, his love for Hazel Grace.Needless to say, that book left me sobbing. It's the kind of book that punches you in the chest, rips out your heart and then goes for your soul. And you know what? It feels good. Because book like these make you feel alive after a little part of you has died.Augustus Waters, you're a great character and I miss you already. You can live in my Capital-S Somewhere and be happy and healthy and with Hazel Grace, where no one can hurt you."
5," Love stories can either end in death or estrangement. .I have read many a tale of love ending in a tragic death. I thought I will close the book as soon as I get a gist of the plot. After all , what new will this love story have?  So what kept me going till the last page were the characters Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters. They have cancer and they are teen kids. But they have super cool personalities. Indeed they have this mature attitude towards life that it is hard to believe they are so young. But imminent death could do a lot to people. When you do not have ample time, you try to focus on the big picture. Hazel and Gus are in love inspite of the futility of their relationship. They think it is worthy. To quote from the book , some infinities are larger than others. A short time spent with someone special might feel like forever and infinite. I read some reviews that people cried a lot. I cried a little at the end but that's it. What I felt was sadness and wanted to get over the book as soon as possible. I did not want to be haunted. As long as the characters were with me , I neither loved them or despised them. I was just a silent observer. But as soon as I closed the book, I felt  a terrible loss. Though I wanted to move on to another book so that I can stop the haunting , I still cannot let go of the book until I went through all my notes and marks. I reread sections of the book and fell in love again and again.I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly at first and then all at onceA beautiful book in retrospection!"
5," Such a good book. Made me think and consider the life I am living...am I making a difference existing?I am glad I read it BEFORE seeing the movie!Be prepared to think, and cry, and not want it to end!"
4, This book is amazing and perfect in every way. I love it and it should be cherished and read by everyone. I believe everyone should read this amazing story about two wonderful people falling in love. It's just plain amazing.
5," loved the book! I was devastated that hazel and Gus didn't live a longer love life together. Some reason this book tells me that I am able to be loved, with all things wrong with me. One day I hope to have a Gus of my own."
5," laughed, I cried, but mostly, I believed these characters.  I love a book that makes me want to meet the characters, that makes me sad they are not real. Like Hazel, I really want to know what happens after the novel ends."
5," The book got to my house so quickly. I actually just finished the book recently. I've never read anything so amazing. It makes you cry , think, and laugh all at the same time. Definitely buying another book from this author!"
5," will not give any spoilers away. But I will say that this is now one of my favorite books. The author is brilliant. He made the BEST snarky, smart, fun loving teenagers.Makes you think of metaphors differently."
5," A great story with thrilling love, John Green portrays the hardships of a girl who loves a boy but does not want to die and leave him lonely, with a horrible twist you will never see coming, I recommend this read to anybody."
2, loved this book- a great read &amp; have shared it with my teenaged daughters who also loved it also. Beautifully written with great insight into the teenage mind as well as death &amp; illness. Heart-warming &amp; highly recommended!
5," This book was a wonderful read that I couldn't put down. It's blunt and straightforward. I can't remember the last book I've read that  I laughed one moment, sat in deep thought, and cried all in one chapter. Beautiful book."
5, would recommend this book mostly to teenagers and to young cancer patients. It is an amazing novel and has much emotion in it. One minuet there will be laughs and moments later there will be tears. And there WILL be tears.
5, Fabulous.  Many scars have been woken up in my heart reading this.  This book has helped me to smell so much more around that fire hydrant.  This book will have u laughing and crying  all at the same time. Thank u Mr. Green.
5," Warning:  This book will break your heart.When I started I held this book at arm’s length, mostly because I knew the subject matter was heavy, and then, after reading the first chapter, because I didn’t much care for the voice of the narrator.  I almost set it aside a couple times in the first 50 pages, but I soldiered on, driven by the fact that so many of my friends recommended it.  I’m glad I stuck with it because this book touched me. For example, there’s this gem about midway through:“I fell in love with him like you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once.”The characters are what I enjoyed most about this book, which allowed me to ignore some of the other things I didn’t much enjoy like the writing style—this is my first John Green—and the voice of the Protagonist—gasp!—which I had a hard time connecting with.  I absolutely adored Augustus.  I want an Augustus!  I felt that Augustus, at least for me, was the star of this book.  Without this character, I definitely would have set it aside.  He had a great personality; it filled the pages.  He added a lighter, comedic element to an otherwise heavy book, and he even got serious Hazel to lighten up a bit.I’m not sure I’ll read another John Green book, though I’m a fan of Will Grayson, Will Grayson, which John Green co-wrote with David Levithan, one of my favorite young adult authors, but I’m certainly glad that I read this one.  This book didn’t make it to my favorites shelf, but it touched me, and that’s more than I can say for some other books I’ve read. (more reviews at [...])"
5," don't read much young adult, but I am glad I read this one.  I was forewarned to go into this with an open mind and a box of kleenex.  I wasn't in love with Gus immediately.  His character took a little bit of time to really develop for me.  I found Hazel to be hilarious and so smart.  I loved her conversations with her mom about just being a kid and getting out of the house.  And Isaac, that kid is my favorite.  Seriously he cracks me up!  I felt so bad for everything that these teenagers were going through, but they were strong, and they stuck by each other and were surrounded by support.  I feel like these characters appeared older than they were, but I can only assume that when you are dealing with these life changing uncertainties that becoming beyond your years is inevitable.We've all faced that book where at the end we have questions.  Yes the author may have wrapped things up nicely, but still, we have questions.  Gus won me over when he used his wish for him and Hazel.  I think that trip was an important once in a lifetime adventure that they were both deserving of.  I didn't really enjoy the scene at the house when they visit the author.  Maybe I was just too much like Hazel, just wanting him to give her the answers to her questions.So now at the end of this book, I'm left with a few questions, which I understand why is was done that way and it makes sense, but it won't stop me from still having questions.  All in all, it was well written and I enjoyed reading it and I'm looking forward to seeing it in the theater!"
4," The Fault In Our Stars by John Green is a lovely young adult novel. Hazel Grace Lancaster has terminal thyroid cancer and she joins a support group to help cope with her clinical depression. In support group, Hazel meets Augustus Waters who lost a limb due to his bone cancer which is now in remission. Augustus falls deeply in love with Hazel, but Hazel has reservations and anxiety when it comes to her feelings for Augustus. Hazel is attracted and intrigued by Augustus but she is afraid to act on her feelings for him. Hazel knows that her cancer will never get better, she will only get sicker and sicker. I don't want to give too much away but I liked The Fault In Our Stars but I didn't love it. I felt like some of the dialogue was a little far-fetched. Teenagers don't normally talk in such a detailed and grown-up matter. Augustus and Hazel are very smart but I felt like John Green made them sound like 40 year-olds. I also felt like Hazel had a dramatic personality shift halfway through the novel. Hazel is shy and reserved one minute, and the next - she's unlikable and disagreeable. I also found Augustus a little too smug and overreaching. I think my favorite character in the novel was Isaac. Isaac's emotional pain he experiences after he becomes blind felt so real and unfiltered. The best scene is when Isaac throws eggs at his ex-girlfriend's car. It's hilarious. The Fault In Our Stars was a little bit overhyped but I'm in my early '30s and since this is a young adult novel - I'm sure that age bracket will enjoy this novel immensely. John Green is a funny and sensitive writer so give this quirky little novel a chance. Enjoy! Okay? Okay."
4, This is a fabulous book that will make you cry and want to hug everyone you have ever encountered. This book is a very easy read and hopefully the movie will do the book justice. Please make sure you have the tissues ready.
3," like to think I'm not very emotional.. but this, this brought me to tears. I have read several books and none of them will ever be as wonderful as this. Please read this, you won't regret it. I have no other words to say."
5," John Green has once again written a funny, touching, and intellect story for the young adult crowd and anyone else interested in a good story. For anyone fromilar with John's works you will have come to expect nothing more."
2, bought this as a gift at the request of my 14-year-old daughter who has read it several times. She is an avid reader of everything from tween sci-fantasy to adult literature including Greek mythology and English classics.
5," This is one of the most beautiful books I have ever had the fortune of reading. It is beautiful, with many rememberable quotes, but it will cause you great emotional pain and make you question yourself, your life, and love."
5, This book trusts the reader and lets the narrator tell life like it is not like we pretend it is. Its well written and beautifully paced. I truly enjoyed the story and the characters. I highly recommend this book. Loved it!
5, The young adult category under which this book has been marketed does not do justice to its universal appeal.  All mature readers are likely to enjoy learning what this sassy narrator has to share about her deep insights.
5," Even though she is battling with her cancer Augustus looks beyond that and that is what makes this book great! Plus, what the message I got from this book is even though you are struggling you can overcome it and find love."
5," This novel is about a teenager and cancer and love and friendship and so much more.  The story is compelling and emotional and at times, humorous.  I will try some of Mr. Green's other novels since I liked this one so much."
5," A beautifully-written, witty, ingenious novel. This is not your average cancer book. It is so much more than that. It's about life, love, suffering, consciousness. I have no more words. Just read the book. It is flawless."
5," have not taken the time to read many books in my few years, so needless to say i am vastly behind in the world of good literature. this book, is a perfect combination of comedy and tragedy, John Green has outdone himself."
5,"ve never in my life contemplated the consequences of existing, living, dying, loving, until now.That being said, this book made me look at life in a way that is somehow frighteningly comforting.  It made me realize the beauty of death.  Everyone always talks about the beauty of life, but never the beauty of death.  We live in a world where people have made it an unspoken rule that you just don't speak about death.  Because speaking about death is wrong and sadistic and you most certainly can not see the beauty in it.  Because death is bad.  But in this book, death isn't bad.  And it makes you realize that in a way, death is LIFE.  Because when it boils down to it, aren't we all dying?  We're walking around everyday in the midst of death, yet nobody stops to realize the importance.Also, you can't speak badly about dead people.  Because when someone dies, were supposed to remember the good things about them.  But what if the person was mean?  A real grade A jerk.  What then?  A lot of the time, the bad in life goes hand in hand with the good.  So why, in death, is it unacceptable to think, or speak, about the bad?This book speaks on all these subjects and more.  It opens your eyes to a new way of living, of life, and death.  If you walk away from this book having felt, and learned nothing, it's not the book you need to reevaluate.  It's you.I recommend this book to literally anyone and everyone.  There's a lot to be learned here, you need to start somewhere, and it might as well be this book."
5," actually got to this book because my mother read it and said she really liked it but it wouldn't be anything for me so I kind of wanted to prove to her that it is and started reading. Every time I talked about it to someone they were like You read that, that's a girls book but it didn't really bother me so just as a heads up, this review is written by a guy.By god, I did not feel so strongly about a book in quite a while. I love it, I really do. It's a great book, I love the style it is written because it's not your everyday language in wide parts, you can read it very well and it just doesn't get boring - I read it within two days. The thing I was really worried about was, that I had knew part of what was going to happen so I was a little worried that it would be not that good of a book for me but it was just as good as if I hadn't known anything... Now to the hate it part, of course I'm not going to spoiler anyone so I'll try to stay very unspecific. This book has, in my eyes, not a happy ending even though it's a good ending, it's not a nice one and I mean I loved the book on the one side but really hated the last third on the other side. Not because of how it was written and I didn't really hate it but it kind of opens your eyes to how good my life actually is and how blessed I am which makes me a little angry which on the other hand obviously means that Hazel's life is not that great.Sorry if this was a little confusing but I just wanted to put my thoughts down.Thanks for reading and have fun with this book"
2," This is a novel that will stay with me for a long time. I loved their voices.....their candor, their humor, and their truthfulness. I cried during the last 20 pages.And now I am going to go and hug my children."
5," loved this book.  I had read several John green books before I read this one, but this one was probably my favorite.  The story has just the right amount of humor and heart while dealing with a very tough subject matter."
5, You are so busy being you that you have no idea how utterly unprecedented you are. I can't pull my ideas together. My thoughts are stars that I can't fathom into constellations.Genius.
5, loved the whole book in general. The book. The plot. The characters. Everything. I was scared you were going to end the book like an imperial infection and I panicked when I got to the end. I love this book. I really do.
5," The Fault in Our Stars, is an amazing story that I highly recommend to anyone who is looking for that special book. This novel will make you stop and take a moment to really ponder a new perspective on what we call life."
5," This is the first and only book that I've read by John Green. Some people might be astounded by that fact, and I can now see why. The Fault in Our Stars is beautifully written and I've fallen in love with Hazel and Gus. I even like Gus's friend Isaac. These characters are teenagers afflicted with a horrible thing called cancer, but they don't let that stop them from living or loving. They enjoy their lives even though they know that their days are numbered... because they know their days are numbered. I think that's what I like most about this book. The characters just keep living the best way they can and that's all you can ask of anyone. It was refreshing to read a book about people with cancer that isn't all about the fact that they have cancer. I do understand why a few people have said that they didn't really like the characters of this book. They said that Hazel and Gus were too pretentious and didn't act like any teenager they knew. I disagree with that assessment. Hazel and Gus are lovers of words. They love to read books and it would make sense that they'd love to use the words that they've learned from books. They aren't like other teenagers because they're more interested in books written by older people with more sophisticated vocabulary than most teenagers possess. I believe that Hazel and Gus would love reading the books that a lot of teenagers hate to read these days such as classics by Charles Dickens and Jane Austen. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves YA romance novels and to anyone who is a lover of words."
5, Best book I have ever read in my entire life! Literally gonna curl up in my room and think about how lucky I am to have such a good life to be living cancer free. Thank you john green for making me realize how lucky I am!
5, Lovely story that was not too intense regarding death and cancer.  Concentrated on the quality of a life instead of the quantity.  Read it as your young adult is reading it.  Great conversations will be the direct result.
5," There aren't enough words to express how truly beautiful this book was written. It's amazing how much a book can change your perspective on life, and I could only wish to experience a love so beautiful! It was marvellous."
5, read this book because my friend told me it was good. I have read this twice now. Both times I loved Augustus and Hazel and each time I cried for them and the book and I definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone.
2, Amazing. The love August had for Hazel was true and genuine. This novel goes beyond children with cancer and tells a story about young love. The life of Augustus Waters will live on. The Fault in Our Stars is a must read.
5," chose this rating simply because this book is excellent. It took exactly no time at all for me to feel for these characters. All the communication between characters felt fluid and natural, and they felt terribly human."
5," Few books affect me as this one has. Criticisms of style are quibbles. The essential truths are gems. Thank you, John Green, for bringing these characters and story to life in me, even if they never were alive themselves."
5, This is one of the best books I've read in years.  Simple truths revealing that simple is not shallow.  The truth is deep and flawed and imperfect.  Wonderfully written with insight I can only guess comes from experience.
5," absolutely loved his book! Absolutely amazing!  I laughed and tears rolled down my face! It felt so real,  so true and very heartfelt. These charecters are real to me and I will miss Augustus!  My life has been touched."
5,"ncredibly beautiful and inspiring. As the mother of two with a congenital disorder- though not life threatening- this book reminded me how precious life is, and how kids that face these bad cards know it better than all."
5," When you read the summary given, you will automatically assume that it's just another book about a cancer patient, it is not. I cannot even put into words how amazing this book is.I just advise you to read it."
5," don't think there is a book that I highlighted more quotes in, this book was filled with one liners that could be powerful on their own. Having read all of John Green's books, this one may just end up being my favorite."
5," really loved this book! If you’re into young adult books, this is for you. This book is also a teen drama. This is about a topic that not many people like to talk about. It's about a 16 and 17 year boy and girl who met in a cancer support group. there are two lead characters hazel and Augustus. Hazel has this type of cancer when she can't breath property by herself. she needs to carry or wheel an oxygen tank wherever she goes. Hazel  has been battling this cancer since she was 13. Hazel's parents had forced her to go to this support group and she doesn't want to go at all. when she finally gave in she went and met this cute guy as hazel calls him, Augustus. Augustus waters has a type of cancer also. But with his type of cancer he had lost his left leg from the knee down.  cancer books suck hazel's had stated which is true. It's true cancer books do suck, who would want to read about a cancer teenager or child dying? the minor subject about this book is the cancer. the major subject about this book is Hazel and Augustus. This is the major subject because we have two teens who is stuffing from cancer and they are just trying to live a normal life as much as they can. As the book goes on you'll find out that Hazel and Augustus becomes really great friends or even best friends. they both took a trip to Amsterdam so they can meet their favorite author of a book they both really like and want to get answers to. When they get back some things had happened. I'm not saying you should go and read it to find out what had happened."
5," Being a cancer survivor myself and having had lost a dear friend to cancer, I wasn’t super eager to pick this book at first. Reading a story where I knew someone with cancer was going to die could easily hit too close to home. But when the kindle price dropped, I figured I decided to give it a try.This is the first book by John Green that I’ve read, and I also have not seen the movie. This was a quick read that kept me engaged. I basically read it in two sittings. It wasn’t one of those books that I couldn’t put down, but it kept me reading when I had it open.One thing that I really liked about it was how easy it was to feel like I was right there. I had vivid of images of most of the places in the story. The characters were enjoyable and I liked the way they related to one another, dealing with the realities of their illness in believable ways. Augustus was my favorite.I wasn’t wowed like I thought I would be. Maybe I had higher expectations due to all the hype. So many people say it’s one of the best books they’ve ever read, but I just didn’t feel that way. I did enjoy it: I laughed and cried, but I found it difficult to connect with the characters emotionally. Another thing was the ending was abrupt and not where I expected it. (Though it didn’t end mid-sentence like I suspected it might.)Overall, I would recommend The Fault In Our Stars. It’s an engaging, enjoyable read that will make you think, and you will also experience a wide variety of emotions. Hopefully, you’ll be wowed!"
2," Loved this book.  I'm an older guy, so teen perspective books are not always appealing to me.  But the two main characters here are so engaging that it was very enjoyable to be with them.  Good for this 50 year-old dude."
4, love this book! Hits very close to home for me as my young daughter passed from cancer. It was very eye opening to see what it is like from their side of things. While at times it was hard to read I am glad that I did.
5," This book was just what I needed. The characters drew me in and gave me hope. It was a pleasant surprise to see characters that were witty and fun, smart and charismatic, while faced with challenges I can't even imagine."
5," This is a wonderful and tragic story, it's one of my favorites actually...... If I had only a few words to describe it they would be Best. Book. Ever!! Thank you John Green for producing such a beautiful book. I love ya!"
5," This book was recommended by my 19 year old daughter. It was a quick and easy read, so long as you had a box of tissues nearby.  Perfect book for any age.  It garnered true and raw emtion from me. A very, very good book."
5,"t was a beautifully written novel and touched  me emotionally. Through personal experiences, I was able to relate to the characters and their motives. It was one of the best novels I have ever read.  Highly recommended!"
5, This book was amazing. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to read a phenomenal book. I wish I could give it 20 stars but I can't. This book made me out my life in perspective. This book had changed my life forever.
5," loved this book and have recommended it to everyone I know. The characters were well-developed and memorable, and the story was amazing. I have read all of John Green's books -- this one is my favorite. Read this book!"
5," The author maintained a high intellectual level, while drawing the reader into the story.  The characters were so interesting and engaging, it was easy to empathize with them in spite of the depressing subject of cancer."
5," read this novel in one sitting. It was beautiful, heart wrenching, raw, insightful, funny, and thought-provoking-sometimes all at once. I just sat and cried at the end for so many reasons. This book deserves ten stars."
2," This is one of those books that messes you up for awhile after you read it. Hazel is a 16 1/2 year old with has stage 4 Thyroid Cancer. She is taking a medication that has halted her cancer from growing further. She is slowly dying. She wears oxygen and cannot walk or stand for very long without feeling short of breath. She meets Agustus who is a 17 year old boy that was diagnosed with Osteosarcoma, had his leg amputated, and is in remission. This is their story.This book was so amazing I can't even put it into words. I was shocked when I scanned the reviews and saw a few bad reviews. One of them actually said that cancer has been overdone. Considering 1 in 2 will have a cancer diagnosis in their life, I don't think there are enough books where the main character is living with cancer. I feel sorry for the people that weren't affected by this book. How could you not?Some of my favorite quotes:Mom sobbed something into Dad's chest that I wish I hadn't heard, and that I hope she never finds out that I did hear. She said, 'I won't be a mom anymore.' It gutted me pretty badly.'Okay, please draw a circle.' I did. 'Now draw a smaller circle within that circle'. I did. 'The larger circle is virgins. The smaller circle is seventeen-year-old guys with on leg.''How are the eyes?' 'Oh excellent,' he said. 'I mean, they're not in my head is the only problem.' 'Awesome, yeah,' Gus said. 'Not to one-up you or anything, but my body is made out of cancer.'"
5," liked the writing style and how the kids seemed pretty believable... but they seemed to use a lot of words that kids just don't use, which reminded me of Dawson's Creek. If you've seen that show, you know what I mean."
5,"m not what you'd consider a quick reader and I bore easily; a book really needs to grab me quickly before I loose interest. I found myself squeezing time in for reading, when I started this book! Thank you John Green!"
4, honestly don't know what to say. This book has opened my eyes on cancer and the people affected by it and their struggle to to fight the cancer and survive. This is a very touching book and I truly enjoyed every word.
5, This story had my complete attention from the beginning. I look forward to the day my sixteen year old daughter has finished reading this book so we can share our thoughts.I highly recommend this book to everyone!
5," This book is the best book I've ever read!  I totally recommend that if you love romantic stories, you read this!  The story line was exceptional and the word descriptions were terrific!  Over all I recommend this book!"
5," This book is the best book I have ever read. The set up of the pages and the words were perfect. But the ending was a bit confusing to me, maybe it's because I was reading really fast. Eh...I LOVE THIS BOOK SO MUCH!! :D"
5," This book was so good, so emotional, so true in a sense that I didn't think was possible. If that makes sense, I really just... I can't dictate my thoughts for this book, it just is a book you need to read for yourself."
5, Really enjoyed this story about teenagers that are just trying to be as normal as possible living with cancer. They have a beautiful story about their friendship and is a great insight to the lives of a cancer teenager.
5," Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters meet at Support Group held at the Literal Heart of Jesus.  And then...  they watch a movie, exchange favorite books, go on a picnic, share a Wish.  Beautifully written.  Totally engaging."
2," Very recently, most people in the UK were deeply touched by the story of a young man called Steven Sutton. Steven died of bowel cancer aged only 19 but not before he had raised over 3 million pounds, from his hospital bed, to help other young people in a similar plight. He lived a short life but few would disagree that it was, a great life well lived. The Fault in Our Stars concerns young people just like Steven, destined to live much shortened lives as the victims of this cruel disease. It tells of their hopes and fears, their loves and aspirations, the rigours and the pain of both the treatments and the disease itself. It is a story both deeply sad yet brilliantly uplifting and is a testimony to the strength of the human spirit and its unwillingness to give up and go quietly. At the centre of the book is a support group for young people and a most touching story of new and fulfilling love between a boy and a girl for whom the hope of a long and happy life is non-existent. It is about short lives lived to the utmost with humour and joy and about the way this disease touches and distorts the lives of ordinary families. This would not normally be reading material of choice for me but I was compelled to read it because of Steven Sutton. I am so glad I did as it turned out to be one of the finest books I've read in a very long time. Many years ago I finished reading The Road, by Cormac McCarthy and on closing it, immediately realised that I'd just read a masterpiece. This book made me feel the same. Quite brilliant."
5," This is absolutely the best book I have ever read. Okay ? Okay. This book is genius yet enjoyable . I admit I cried my little heart out, but I am not ashamed what so ever.  I definitely recommend this book to everyone!"
5," loved this book. this book has touched my heart forever, i never knew you could fall in love with a book character in just 100 and something pages. this book will change my life, for the better of course. okay? okay."
5," This book is amazing, there's nothing more to it. Well-written, with a good plot and good characters.... It is simply amazing. Just read it. Trust me, you won't be disappointed, no matter what style you usually prefer."
5, The fault in our stars is one of the best books I have ever read. Towards the end I don't think I have ever cried so much. The relationship between Hazel and Gus was unique. They made me laugh and cry at the same time.
5," This book started my John green addiction, it was amazing as my title stated and it made me cry and felt as though the characters were my best friends and I was so sad when it ended all together the best book I've read"
5," The title pretty much says it all. Regardless of the type of book you like to read, John Green has written one of the best books in the past decade. It's a roller coaster of a book. You won't regret buying this book :)"
5, This book is by far the best book I have ever read. I normally don't cry when I read books but this book really got to me. I would tell everybody who gets the chance to read this book to read it. You won't put it down.
5," don't think it will ever be possible for me to read this book without crying. It is probably the best book I've ever read, and I feel privileged to have ever found it. Words can't describe how this book made me feel."
5,"m so glad I finally bought a copy of this book! It's been on my TBR list for such a long time, and I've read so many good reviews about it. I was a little worried that this book wouldn't be as good as I was hoping, just because of how hyped up it was. But thankfully, it was amazing. However, it was much different than I was expecting it to be, though I don't really know if I can describe how what I thought it was going to be like. I loved the characters of Hazel, Augustus and Issac; I thought their relationships were written so well and felt genuine. I also loved that although they were all dealt crappy cards in life, there was so much humor in their friendship. Hazel really starts to open up and live a more full life when she meets Augustus. Its great for readers to realize that just one person can make such a huge difference in someone's life, regardless of their situation. I think we could all use a friend like Augustus; he showed Hazel that there is more to life than just waiting to die from a terminal illness. He got her to do things and think about the world in a different light.I'm so happy that I read this book. I think John Green is a masterful storyteller, and this definitely won't be the only book of his that I read! I can't wait to go back to the bookstore and find his others (: I highly, highly recommend this to everyone. Its a quick read because it doesn't let you put it down, but its also a very emotional story, which left me with a few tears.Pagesofcomfort.blogspot.com"
2," Young adult fiction.  Sweet yet complicated story of teenagers who have cancer and an outlook on life that differs from the fighter perspective we often read about.  A good read, easy, but thought provoking."
5," would honestly recommend this book fir everyone who is into all the sad but, cute love stories. This book was funny. Yet, sad and heartbreaking at the same time. It was amazing and I'd really read it all over again."
4," This is the best sad and romantic book I ever read....u must read this book....I love this quote from the book:  I fell in love with him the way he fell asleep, slowly then all at once.....it's so beautiful to me!!!"
5," This book was absolutely captivating. I have not been reading much other than Game of Thrones and this was a true gift. From the beginning to end it held me! the characters, the way John Green writes is all wonderful!"
5," Words can't describe... It's real, and that's what makes it beautiful. Hazel and Augustus have such strong personalities for such insignificant people. But to know them in this book was a blessing."
5," loved the book. One of my favorite quotes was: You can put bacon on a sandwich without anyone freaking out. But the moment your sandwich has an egg, boom, it's a breakfast sandwich. -The Fault in Our Stars"
5, really enjoyed reading this book.  That seems funny to say considering the topic of childhood cancer.  I felt like I knew these characters and certainly shed a tear or two throughout the book.  Highly recommended!!!
5, Great for a book club book!  This was a quick read for me because I became so invested in the storyline and I could't wait to find out what the outcome for the characters was going to be!  A real sweet love story too!
4," had a few friends recommend this book to me and I thought it was AWESOME. I was the only one out of all of my friends to not cry at the end. LOL:p but all in all, best book I've ever read and I would read it again:)"
5, Excellent book.  Caught my interest right away and made for a quick read.  The characters were well developed and believable.  I may propose this as a pick for my book club group as it has plenty in it for discussion.
2, Amazing book  John! I know he doesn't read these mostly but I loved the book! I was actually disappointed when I finished because I wanted to keep reading! Can't wait for the TFiOS movie!!&lt;3NerdCrafter13XD
5," The Fault In Our Stars. Simply beautiful. John Green did an amazing job. He made each character unique, yet all relatable. It makes you reflect upon your own life. It has me balling my eyes out. This book was amazing."
5," This books brings out the ugly and beauty in this world. With diseases, family, friends, love, strangers, history..all captive in this book. I would recommend this book to anyone that forgot or don't know how to live."
5," This book was beautifully written and let me be honest, I cried. I recommend this book to everyone (teens, adults, etc) but okay if you want a book that involves a happy ending, this is not the book for you my friend."
5,"n my 37yrs of life, I have read many, many books.  This book is so powerful, yet thoughtful.  You will laugh. You will cry. Yes, it is written for young adults, but it is the kind of book that most people will enjoy."
5," Such a great book! Laughed, cried... Cried some more. John Green does an incredible job of capturing the feelings of a teenager. Gave these out as gifts for a party and the ladies were excited to receive it and read!"
5, truly enjoyed reading this book. Each character was developed well with a sense of sarcasm and humor surrounding a tragic situation. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in a light heart touching novel.
5," first saw the movie preview and when it was mentioned that it was based on a book, I immediately bought it. One of the best books I have ever read. I simply loved the story of Augustus and Hazel Grace. A must read."
5," was so enamored of this book.  It was perfectly written, beautifully put together and a dream to read.  Highly, highly recommend.  I desperately cared about the characters, and went out and bought more of his work,"
5," have read this book on vacation, and I, well, can't put it into words. If you're looking for a good read that will leave its mark on you, then look no further. The Fault in Our Stars is perfection put into words."
2," Really loved this story. It has been a long time since a story made me cry, but it wasn't sappy at all. The characters did seem older than their years, but when faced with serious health issues it is not unrealistic."
5,"m into books that make me think. Not just thoughtless, cliche romance stories or predictable mysteries. And this book exceeded every single expectation I had. I guess in the end, all I need to say is A+ John Green."
5," This has been one of the most touching and teen-realistic book I have ever read. Many teens like me go through difficult challenges and pain, but we still live through the end.I do, Augustus.I do."
5, Very interesting view from teenage cancer victims. Their views are written for teens and adults and expresses grief and joy. The teens show happiness and deep sadness over death and remissions shared with each other.
5, really liked the romantic story behind it and it really tells you how for example people with cancer really feel it makes you think about all of these other things and can really  change your perspective on things.
5," This book was #1 on Time Magazine's list of best books of 2012, so I decided to give it a try.  I've just finished it with tears in my eyes. I don't recall the last time a book moved me like this. Kind of speechless."
5," This has probably been on of the best books I've ever read and I'm sure I'll be quoting and re-reading it for an infinitive amount of time. I feel in love with this book like you fall asleep; slowly,then all at once."
5,"ve been trying to read this book for 6 months.  I love to read and yet, I always find myself putting this book down only to pick it back up a month later in hopes of finishing it so I can finally start a new book."
5, This book is the best book I have ever read. Words can't explain my love for this amazing book. I could re-read it 183849394 times and still feel the same way I felt when I first read it. It'll leave you speechless.
5," thought this book really hits your emotions. but in a different way than most books would, you don't have to know the characters to feel sorry or anger towards them. like when Augusts dies I cried for a long time."
2, think the writing is clever and the character development is decent but the plot is sloppy. The significant moments are abrupt and have an arbitrary feeling. I think Van Houten could have been left out entirely.
5, This was an insightful look at how young people handle cancer. Entertaining and I loved it...even though it was sad at times. There were some humorous times as well. I would definitely suggest it to others to read!!
2, This book was AMAZING! Every detail and word Green wrote made me fall in love with characters. This book is so much better than Green's Looking For Alaska.This is my new favorite book and i recommend it to everyone.
5," cried more times than I'd like to count, but I also found myself smiling and giggling quite often while reading this wonderful book. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a good cry, a good laugh and a good read."
5,t's so perfect. It came 3 days before it was supposed to come. This book will make you cry like a baby but it is so worth it. you get attached to the characters and it really makes you think. 10/10 would read again
5," When i first saw the title i thought that this would be a mediocre story with a cool, new age-y title. Turns out its and honestly written story thats unexpectedly deep and quite entertaining. you should read it too."
5, The plot is simple but it's such a well written story that can be read in one sitting. It will make you laugh and definitely make you cry. I am not a YA and it made no difference ... it's a LOVELY book. A must read!
5," One of my students lent me her copy of this book, and I devoured it.  I had to own my own. The characters are funny, sad and wonderful all at the same time.  I look forward to cherishing this book for years to come."
5, Great read! I loved the characters Hazel and Augustus. It was a quick read and I loved  reading from an adolescents perspective on having cancer. Although sad it was also uplifting. I Definitely recommend this book!
5," have never been one to write reviews, but this book deserves to be read. I felt so many emotions reading this book that I can't even begin to describe them. It's just something you have to experience for yourself."
2," The first few pages were hard for me to focus on but once I got about 5 pages in I was completely hooked. It sounds like you’re listening to the typical teenager ranting about how much their life sucks but Hazel is a little different in that she has cancer. This isn’t your usual girl meets boy, girl + boy fall in love and live happily ever after; no the story is more devastating for obvious reasons, cancer still being a taboo subject and all, yet they manage to find a love that went beyond the physical and traditional. I laughed, I sighed, and inevitably I cried through the emotional roller coaster John Green puts you on. You get sucked into the pages and walk the journey with Hazel and Augustus and ponder the questions they ask themselves; you try to put yourself in their shoes for just a moment and find yourself drowning in the realistic and depressing state of mind that Hazel is usually in while smiling and wishing you could be as open and quirky as Augustus should you ever be in a similar situation. The Novel showcases the worst part of living while putting the spotlight on the best parts of handling the situation. I give the book 5 stars for a few reasons: 1. It’s a realistic portrayal of being a teenager with cancer. 2 The author grabs you and MAKES you become emotionally invested in the outcome. 3. It shows that love does prevail no matter the circumstances and outward appearance of a person.Original Post at: http://babygotstacks.com/2014/03/02/the-fault-in-our-stars/"
5," just finished The Fault In Our Stars. It’s a young adult romance written by John Green. It’s about a girl who is in remission from cancer. She goes to these support group meetings to please her mother, who thinks she’s depressed. There, she meets a boy who she likes. The book is a story of their lives and the lives of those around them.My description of this book doesn’t do it justice. However, I didn’t want to give anything away. So I was trying to be as vague as possible. I can get a bit carried away sometimes. I felt I could relate to the main character. I don’t mean her illness. I mean her personality. I felt like I could completely relate to her personality and sense of humor. I love when I can relate to characters in the book I’m reading. Marks it up for a great read in my book.A few times throughout the book, I was reminded of the story A Walk To Remember. They are, in a way, very similar. They are definitely both very sad. They also both have messages of hope in them. You just have to dig hard enough to see that message sometimes. I found both stories very enjoyable. I’m sure that I will read A Fault In Our Stars a million more times before it’s all said and done.I fully recommend this book to everybody. By everybody, I do mean everybody. This is a beautifully written story. It’s real and it’s sincere. I love this book. I’m so glad that I was given an opportunity to read a book so beautiful and sad. I loved it. I’m sure many others will too."
5, Mr. Green:Your were able to put some of my deepest questions and thoughts into words so that I was forced to follow through all the way to the end where I learned much about myself and my feelings. Thank you!
5," would recommend this book to anybody, it makes you think about the world more and realize that life is short so make the most out of it. Gus is a gentleman and the girl is so wise. read this book.. it's worth it!"
5, A simple perspective written and made incredibly popular by a man who could fathom his stars into constellations. He did not need anything but his words to make this story as heartbreaking and real as it should be.
5," Bought this book for my daughter for Easter.  Could never get it from the library.  She absolutely loves the book and story.  Overall, an excellent book, but the language can be a little rough for younger children."
5," This is a must read! This story is truly beautiful, it is about a young couple falling in love but they both have cancer. It's there romantic journey through life and the hard experience that one of them will face."
5,"m a guy, and I don't usually like these kinds of books, but I have no shame in saying I loved this book, it will always be apart of me and I cried at some parts. This book was fantastic and I highly recommend it."
5," No words can describe this book. When ever you read or watch something it should always leave you with a feeling. Either it being sad, angry, happy, hopeful. This book left me with all of that. Beautifully written."
5," have read most of his Green's books now, and this is my favorite. The narrator/main character has a great sense of humor, and I found myself laughing a lot. I hope my kids will read this book when they are teens."
2," This book was outstanding. I laughed and cried, and I enjoyed it so much. I just wish I could read it again for the first time. Thank you, John Green, for this marvelous book. I definitely recommend it to everyone!"
5," My Thoughts:Well, I finally got caught up on the bandwagon right before the movie came out in theaters, which was a good thing. I kinda like knowing what I'm getting into before I see a movie. And I have to say, my book reading experience versus movie watching experience was a little different.I did enjoy the book, but I actually liked the movie a lot more. Maybe it was because of how well the movie was made, I'm not sure. All the important elements from the book were portrayed as they should have been. The story itself... John Green is nothing short of genius when it comes to these kinds of stories. They're DIFFERENT and in the best and worst ways possible. If that makes sense. It makes sense to me. What I mean is that he takes an idea and he runs with it, and often with unique characters and circumstances. That's why he's a genius. Augustus and Hazel are perfectly and imperfectly paired, and their story is TIMELESS. Better than Romeo and Juliet. Yep, I said it.The Fault In Our Stars is a brilliantly told love story. I don't know how else to describe it. When I read the book, I teared up off and on, but I didn't full on cry... I'm not sure why that is. After watching the movie, seeing it brought to life and bawling my eyes out, well, I'd probably cry if I read it again. In any case, if you haven't read the book/seen the movie--grab your tissues and hold on tight. Because THE FEELS. You will be feeling many feels.My Rating: Very Good."
5," have heard such raving reviews for John Green and this novel. This is the first book by him that I have read. I must say that I found it exceptionally average. Yes, it was full of witticisms, clever remarks, and various other tidbits that made me smile, but I just couldn't get past that fact that the narration was boyish. Perhaps that sounds sexist. Having watched Mr. Green's video blog, I could not separate his voice from Hazels. She did not have the voice of a sixteen year old girl, but more of a thirty-something-year old intellectual male. I also found the way Gus spoke to be highly unbelievable. Not that I don't think that teenagers can't be intellectuals.Much of talked about OTHER novels, music, movies, etc; things which I am not interested in.This novel is in the first person of Hazel Grace, a sixteen year old girl with cancer.*spoilers*Here's a watered down summary of The Fault in our Stars: Hazel meets Gus. They go to Amsterdam to meet some douchey author. They fall in love, Gus dies, Hazel is sad.I was waiting for a twist, or some great storyline, but there wasn't even that. However, having finished the novel I feel as though I can't give it any less than three stars.This book was not absolute rubbish, but it was forgettable. Nothing special.But all that aside, I really felt that not much happened in this novel.I feel that Mr. Green's writing talents would be better suited to a Romantic Comedy."
4," This book was funny, romantic, and yet kept true to the realms of reality of those affected by disease. It is well written and captivates its audience from beginning to end. It leaves its scar on whoever reads it."
3," was disappointed in this book, I have list loved ones, have known cancer, but this just rambled and left me wishing I hadn't pushed myself through. I liked a book that grabs and holds you leaves you wanting more"
5," Beautiful book. It's funny and it's sad, it's heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time. (Spoilers) A beautiful happy ending although not happily ever after, I really enjoyed this book and I cried a lot too."
1, read this book and really got hooked into the characters.  The book flows pretty quickly.  The outcome had me tearful for days afterwards.  The author really strikes a cord with his audience.  Very moving story.
5, did enjoy reading this book but thought the age of the character was not coherent in age with their thoughts.  It was also a depressing book to read even though the ending was more up lifting than the beginning.
5," An extraordinary young adult novel, The Fault in our Stars strikes a perfect balance of tragedy and wicked humor through the eyes of teens battling cancer. I highly recommend this book, but keep the Kleenex handy."
5," Funny, relatable and heart wrenching all at once! A wonderful read.You'll fall for Augustus just as Hazel did and cry profusely when he dies.You can read it again and again... the story never gets old!"
2," Not only is John Green's Fault In Our Stars amazingly written, the book will make your heart wrench in so many ways. The fault in our stars is a book you will definitely need a tissue bow next you, possibly a few."
5," John Green is simply amazing, great story, at one point I already knew what was going to happen but it's still a treat to read. There's so many quotes I can take from this book and reflect on/use in my daily life."
5," ......beautiful, excruciatingly breathtaking, never have I cried for a book, the way I shed tears for this one.......To all the many Augustuses of the world, I keep you all in prayer and in my heart."
5," This is an awesome, original tale.  Loved it from the beginning.  And have now bought others by this author.  Two young would-be lovers, who are facing their own mortality.  Incredible story, very satisfying read!"
5," thoroughly enjoyed this novel that deals with a tough subject (dying of cancer) in a touching, snarky, funny, and irreverent manner. Each character is marvelously developed, and it makes a great read for anyone."
5," of course finished this book a while ago but it has taken me sometime to talk about it because I cried for the majority of the last like 5 chapters. First off let me just say if someone I love in real life dies, it is unavoidable that I will need to be institutionalized, because I am indeed the type of person to cry for the greater part of an hour over a fictional character's death. For the record, before anyone gets all grumpy because *spoilers* they should realize that the book is about cancer and everything you read about it says it has a heartbreaking ending, so if you hadn't put two and two together, I take no blame. Anyways, back to what I was saying, this book.. I do not want a single person to look at this and say they will not read it because it is going to make them sad, because there is a whole story beyond just the sad ending and it is a story that should not go unseen. It is completely fictional, and it is not someone's memoir. This came straight from the amazing mind of John Green. It is not a story for everyone, there is mild cursing, and a few religious/philosophical veiws that some might not agree with. If you are not the kind of person who can read a book without being persuaded against your personal perspectives, then by all means, do not read this. However, if you are like me and can read a book without taking personal offense to the fictional character for not seeing things the way you do, then I will say as clearly as I possibly can, this is a MUST read.."
5," This is the first work of the smart, yet sensitive John Green's that I've read and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I'm not a huge critic when it comes to reviewing media (well, I try not to be), although I feel that I have quite a fair amount of room to comment on this lovely philosophical romantic that I nourished my story-hungry mind with this past weekend. Hey, if the mods of the Amazon Kindle Store will let any old coot say, This book rocks harder than Dwayne Johnson!!, then why can't I? :PStill, if I had to reveal any sort of internal criticism toward this book, it would be rendered toward the fact that Hazel and I would have a few disagreements on beliefs regarding human nature and divine appointments. I understand that this is only a fictional story (and a grand one, at that), but sometimes I feel for the characters more than I should, whether those feelings be positive or negative. I guess this is more of a criticism towards her and not towards the story itself, in which case, excuse me for my excessive bantering. (I did say I wasn't much of a critic)Regardless of whatever other stabs I've taken from it, The Fault In Our Stars is a prime example of why we should be more aware of the outward, not just inward, damages cancer can cause. That and thankfulness plays a huge role in cherishing whatever life we live, so ignoring it would cause bitterness and a negative perspective on life. You wouldn't want that, would you? Happy reading, fellow bookworms!"
5," The Fault in Our Stars is an improbable story, but it doesn't feel like one when you're reading it. It feels exactly right.Maybe it resonates so strongly because of my life as a sick child and then a sick adult who lost most of her sick friends in childhood. Our lives were more predictable because we didn't have cancer, which is unpredictable pretty much all the time, but we were still surprised sometimes. We loved each other and sometimes we fell in love and once in a while the person who died was the one who wasn't supposed to.What I'm getting at is that it's really weird being a kid and having a mental list of which friends are supposed to die first. In so many ways you just stop being a kid the day you realize that, and Green captures that feeling, all of those feelings, better than anyone I've read who wasn't somehow one of us. I was sure that he had lost a child or a sibling to cancer, right up the point in the acknowledgements where he says he didn't. It's that good.So it's also that bad. I felt Hazel's pain and joy and fear so completely it was frightening, even as I was jealous of her strength. Hazel is a beautiful creature, as is Augustus, and their love is a privilege to witness.Bonus points to Green for making up a book for them to bond over rather than using an existing one and turning it into a half-assed lit class. That was a real stroke of genius and made their world all the more real for being wholly fictional."
5, never thought i would like this book and yet i have fallen for it in a way that is reserved for books i read a million more times this book is so real and touching you cant help but like it brilliantly written.
5," loved it all, from start to finish I feel it was very well written! Truth is we don't have a choice about getting hurt in this life, but we can chose who we let hurt us!! It's a breathtaking book in my opinion!"
2, everyone built this book up so much. I thought it couldn't possibly live up to the hype. boy was I wrong. it was even better then I expected it to be. John Green did so many things right in this book. I loved it.
5, The Fault In Our Stars is honestly one of the best books I have ever read!  I love to read and do it often.  I've read hundreds of books and this book would certainly rank in the top ten of all books I've read.
5," don't know you John Green and I don't even care who you are.  With this said...thank you for making me feel, for making me cry! This is why I rate TFIOS as many stars as there is in this universe. BRAVO! BRAVO!"
5," worth the time and money! This have to be my first time reading a teenage novel though being an adult. guess, i am gonna have to read more teenage novels. i've come to respect john green because he is a youtuber."
5," This book, was about what happens to children when they have cancer. What happens after the person you love dies. And that is a great book. I loved it. And I am thankful that John Green wrote this book. Thank you"
5," loved this book from the beginning to start, probably one of the best books I've ever read. I kind of wish I had just taken it from the library though, I read it in one night and have heard others say the same."
5, Don't be thrown by the cancer-angle. Green masterfully navigates this topic by producing amazing characters worth rooting for. A pleasure to read. Recommend to anyone who loves books and thoughtful introspection.
5, loved this book. John Green makes it seem real and just like how two people can fall in love no matter what situation that they are in. I chose a 5 star rating for this book.  I love reading John Green`s books.
5," The Fault in Our Stars was on my ‘must read in preparation for the movie release” list.  I avoided it for a long time because…well you know, its about teens with cancer so it is going to be sad.  I was prepared and if you are considering reading this novel, I suggest you also prepare yourself.  However this book is so filled to the brim with young love, friendship, and even humor, you shouldn’t miss the chance to read the book because you know it will be sad.  Any book written by John Green is going to be good but I can see why this is the book that he is best known for.The story is about terminal cancer patient Hazel (who has destroyed lungs) and Augustus (another cancel patient) who meet in a support group for cancer sufferers.  The two fall in love and discover that they still have a lives to live.  John Green paints a realistic picture of teenagers who just so happen to have cancer.  Their struggles and joys leap off the pages.  These are vibrant characters who aren’t supposed to die.  Shockingly, I am not going to give the book five stars.  I did love this book, but it didn’t quite live up to the hype surrounding it.  I also felt like some more time should have been spent on the families of both Hazel and Gus.  They weren’t ignored but the impact of cancer on a family is so immense it just felt like a little something was missing.  Still, don’t miss this one.  I really look forward to the movie as the trailer so far looks very much in line with the novel."
5," understand that this review will get jumbled up with all the others, because, Writing doesn't resurrect, it buries, in the words of Peter Van Houton. I would like to just put out there that this book moved me so deeply, I swear to the omnipotent God that I sobbed for what must have been the entire last half of the book. The characters were so thorough and beautiful with their own quirks and cons, to a degree you rarely see in books nowadays. John Green has a lyrical breeze to his work that makes it pleasing for the eye and soul, and yet is still reminiscent of an intelligent teenage duo on their deathbeds.***be wary of spoilers that follow this border***The decision to let our charismatic and unfortunately cancerous main man die nearly killed me, it did. Augustus Waters was this perfect blend of beauty, brains, vanity, and modesty. He in himself is a contradicting character: a dying teen fascinated by the mysteries of life.And then there's Hazel Grace Lancaster. A miracle in and of itself. From the beginning I foresaw her death, and when Augustus proceeded to, y'know, kick the bucket, I was shocked and secretly pleased because that meant I could wallow in my sorrows alongside her.***they have ended now***All in all, I look do forward to reaching other works by Mr. Green. Remember, some infinites are larger than other infinities. (I apologize if this is not the actual quote, my teenage memory is dreadful nowadays.)"
2," wasn't sure what I would think of this book because I am in my 30's and typically do not read YA.  But I'm involved in a summer reading group that challenges us to read a book from each of a few different genres.  YA was on the list and since I'd heard this movie was coming out, I figured, why not.  I found myself pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this book.  I found Green's writing to be excellent.  He does a great job of bringing characters, scenes and situations to life.  The dialogue is witty.  And I thought the plot moved at a good pace.  I also especially appreciated that the characters felt genuinely different than those I've met in other books and I thought he dealt with cancer in a way that seemed different than what I've read in other books.  I love that both characters were trying to make as much of their lives as they could and not be defined by cancer, but they also weren't super human or unrealistically positive about what they were going through.I think the one potential criticism I could see of this book is that the dialogue is so good it's a little hard to imagine two teenagers could possibly be this witty and philosophical.  But I was willing to suspend my disbelief because I enjoyed the dialogue so much and because frankly, I'm 30 years old and if the characters talked like normal teenagers I probably would have found them annoying and grating.In short, I think this book is a wonderful read and very much enjoyed it."
5,"n general I greatly prefer reading the book to seeing the movie.  There was so much publicity about The Fault in Our Stars movie that I thought I would try this book I had never heard of.  I am so very glad that I did!  I have not seen the movie and I probably will not because movies never measure up to the book.  Measuring up to this book would be terrifically hard.  It was fascinating, thought provoking, interesting, riveting and hard to put down.  I had it on my kindle and took it everywhere and stole moments whenever I could.  I was so disappointed to end the book.  Not because the ending is bad but because I wanted to keep reading something so enjoyable.The love story of two older teens both suffering from cancer, The Fault In Our Stars makes you think about how you would want to live with a deadly disease. It gives insight into the thoughts of those facing eventual and premature death and the thinking is deep!  It looks at how people face their own potential death or the potential or actual death of those they love.  Having lost a brother to cancer when he was young, this book was really true to life in handling the issues faced by family and especially parents of a child with a deadly disease. The death of someone we love can cause the lives of the living to spiral out of control or can propel them to do bigger and better things for themselves and others.  Definitely a book to make you think about a lot of important questions in life and in death."
5, What an amazing story. I loved it. It's not very often that things are written as they truly are and not a variation of what the work wants to see through rose colored glasses. I'm so glad that I read this book.
5, This book was emotional and didn't have the typical happy ending but it was such a good read.  It was a glimps at a life sick children and the guilt they feel about having a disease that their parents cant cure.
5, Beautifully written book by John Green.  He really knows how to capture the sentimental feelings of the readers. You'll never want to put this book down and you'll end up in tears and laughs throughout the book.
5, John Green has touched my heart forever.  This book alone made me smile like i have never before and to cry from sadness and happiness.  It has accomplished a great deal in my life.  I hope it will in other too.
5,m beyond speechless. John green is a beautiful person and I hope he writes until it's no longer possible. This book has opened my eyes to so much and wow I'm just uh wow. Thank you for writing this John green.
5, This is one of the best books I've ever read....and I read a lot.  The subject matter seems dark but John Green is an amazing writer and the characters are really interesting people.  Very much enjoyed this one.
5," was infatuated with the characters in this book. Couldn't possibly stop reading it, except to finally sleep. How could you possibly not look at your life and your relationships more admirably after reading it."
5, am a big fan of John Green and definitely was not disappointed by this book. It was definitely his best so far. It was funny and smart and sad all at the same time. A beautiful book and definitely a must read.
2," The Fault in Our Stars by John Green is nothing I thought it'd be when I started reading. I did not believe it'd be about a teenage girl living with cancer, who is wise beyond her years. To be honest, I thought it was something about stars and what's wrong with them. I started reading, the first few pages had me giggling a bit. The ending had me crying more than a bit.  Cancer is a important role in this story, but it has not infected the book like most stories involving the wretched disease. Cancer plays a small part in the scheme of the book. Hazel (the protagonist) said it herself, Cancer books suck. Indeed Hazel, indeed. Anyways, I don't want to spoil this story for you. I do need to warn you to have a dictionary, because God knows I used one several times.  I believe the ending was quite sufficient and much more adequate than the one in An Imperial Affliction (which for so long I believed was a real book. Thanks for that John Green, by the way) This book gave me insights I had never viewed before. The book itself teaches a lesson; a real one, not some- Let, me refrain from cussing in the Literal Heart of Jesus. (When you read the book, that'll make sense to you)  But I loved what this story taught me.  This book goes about death the right way, as many books do not achieve. We all know death and this book does illustrate how awful it feels.  It is now my favorite book and I say that with pride. Please, I beg of you: read it."
5," Every now and then, we are lucky enough to read a book that is so complete it makes us feel everything. A novel that truly takes us on an emotional journey that we never could have imagined, a novel that leaves us yearning for more. The Fault In Our Stars does all of this and more without ever feeling forced, rushed, or inauthentic. Green displays an unique talent here; he knows how to make the reader feel - unlike most authors who can only tell the reader how they should feel. Green's words truly emote and this ability is a gift that Green displays throughout TFIOS.By now, we all know the plot; so, instead, I'll tell you what I found most profound about this book and Green's storytelling. Despite the fact that half-way through the book I realized one of the characters would die, despite the fact that this was confirmed with about a third of the book left; my knowledge of the ending did nothing to dull any of the emotions that came as I continued to read. I HAD to continue to read. I HAD to know how the story would end even though I already knew Gus would die. This is a sign of the most masterful storytelling.Green deserves all the accolades he has received for this novel. I have also read some of his other works: An Abundance of Katherines, Looking For Alaska, and Papertowns. TFIOS is far and away superior to any of his other books I have read.Overall: Must read, for the young, old, and in-between. A story you will not forget."
5," Although this book was about teenage cancer, it was a truly beautiful story about the courage and love that Hazel and Gus had for each other.  It was beautifully written. I would definitely recommend this book."
2, OMG!!! I couldnt put the book down. Finished reading in less than a daySuch a beautiful and sad story.Kept sobbing- i cant even remember if i ever cried from reading a book.Highly recommend it
5," laughed, cried, laughed then cried again!  I instantly loved Hazel, she was funny to a fault!  She was real.  I recommend this book to anyone and everyone.  It made me smarter and that is a rarity these days!"
5," Definitely worth the read.  16 more words required, I don't have 16 more words.  Read the book. 3 more words required....you may hate the book, but you may have it reach deep into to your stars in the universe."
5, This book was fantastically written and so touching. I'm in my 30s and loved this novel - it is definitely not just for teens/YA. Be prepared with tissues - I cried my little eyes out through the last 30 pages.
5," Even though it's a book about kids with cancer it does have really tender happy moments.  The characters are wonderful.  Very well written.  Once I got into it, I couldn't put it down.  Definitely worth a read!"
5," You know that this book is going to tug at the heart strings by reading the blurb, but this one obliterated me.  Hot tip: don't read on public transport if you don't want to blubber in front of total strangers."
5," This is the John Green that made me fall in love with his books. Just when you think you know the ending it changes. It's a heartfelt, heart-wrenching story of love and loss and the beauty of a first true love."
5, Very funny. Very touching. But not sentimental. Often you didn't know whether to laugh or cry. Appealing characters. Couldn't put it down. Liked it so much I got two additional copies for friends for Christmas.
5," just finished reading this book, so forgive me if my thoughts are a little jumbled. John Green has the power to do that to us. I mean seriously, as I write this, I'm trying to imagine how August Waters or Hazel Grace might write this review. I'm trying to have as extensive a vocabulary as they have. I'm trying to have a better grasp on the world. Ultimately, I will surely fail, but I can at least give you my not-John-Green-worthy review.So, this book falls into that category of books that you read over and over, the kind that never really leave you and that you want to read enough to be able to quote them at appropriate times. It's the kind that awakens thoughts inside yourself that you've always had but never knew you had. It's the kind that, if you were the kind of person to highlight books, would have you buying at minimum two highlighters because the mark would become streaky and not highlighter-y enough and so you'd have to use a new one.What I'm trying to say is, this book is fantastic. It's tragic but hilarious, sweet and endearing yet utterly honest. I just can't even put it into words.I think for me, reading this was different than a lot of people reading it because I read it not only as a reader, but as an author. I've just come to terms with the fact that I don't deserve to breathe the same air as John Green. I shouldn't be an author if books like his exist. But I am, so I digress.Read this book."
5," Hazel is a sixteen year old cancer survivor. Thyroid with tumors in her lungs. She carries an oxygen tank. Three years ago she had a close call, was ready to say goodbye but was saved (for now) by an experimental drug. I like her attitude. She's smart and sarcastic, optimistic and funny. Her parents are great. Her mom wants her to get out more and meet people and live life. She makes Hazel go to a cancer survivor support group and there she meets Augustus.Augustus is seventeen years old. He had a touch of osteosarcoma which caused him to lose a leg. He is immediately smitten with Hazel. They quickly become friends. A friendship shared with fellow group member, Isaac (eye cancer, both eyes), and book recommendations.Hazel and Gus bond over one book in particular. A book with the end all be all of cliffhangers. As a surprise to Hazel, Gus gets in touch with the reclusive author and uses his cancer wish on a trip to Amsterdam for the couple to meet him. Although Gus is very clear about his feelings for Hazel, she is more reluctant. She knows the reality of her situation and doesn't want any more casualties than necessary.From there the book sort of changes direction. There was an AHA! moment that had me yelling, Nononononono! But even having this prep time and being spoiled to the ending still did not prepare me for the emotions I felt. Green did an excellent job weaving a beautiful story. I absolutely loved it!"
2, basically cried from the time I read that Augustus was dying to the very end. The book was so sad but it really touches on the tie parts of life. It makes you think about life in ways you never think before.
5," don't sit down and read many books in a single day, but this kept me interested the entire way. I thought the characters were a little mature for their age, but it did keep them from being cardboard cutouts."
5, really liked this book. It made me cry laugh smile and many other feelings. I could feel like I was the characters. There is some language though in it that I did not like but the book itself is really good.
5,"ntelligently written - thought-provoking, inspirational, and a good reminder of what our lives should consist. In an era dictated by gadgets and things, Green reminds us all what is truly important."
5, have always wanted to read this book and I finally bought it. I have heard AMAZING reviews on this book and I can't wait to read it. It arrived REALLY quickly which is a wonderful thing. Can't wait to start!
4, honestly cannot stop crying. This book is so unbelievably beautiful and I just cannot get enough of it. I will probably re-read this book over and over again. John Green has really done something beautiful..
5," loved the book. Really beautiful story with just truly wonderful and amazing characters. This book made me feel many many different emotions. I laughed, I cried and just had a really good time with this book"
5," This book is 'young adult' fiction (teenagers?), but as a 20-something I quite enjoyed it. It's well written, emotion, and engaging. When characters in the book felt illness I felt it, too. Highly recommended."
5, wanted a book that I would get attached to as soon as I picked it up. I think this is a wonderful book and I've recommended it to all my friends. This book is still great even if you're not an active reader.
5,t was a beautiful story that actually led me to do some more reading about cancer. If you liked this book also try The Emporer of All Maladies:A Biography of Cancer by Siddhartha Mukherjee. Amazing!
2, John Green will make you ball your eyes out. One of the top five novels currently in existence. A beautiful piece that does not make you crave more. This novel creates a special place in your heart for itself.
5," The Fault in Our Stars by John GreenJohn Green is the author of Looking For Alaska. John Green is an amazing author, one who writes like I would imagine he speaks. He's just very talented!This book follows Hazel, a teen with cancer. She meets Gus at a cancer support group and, well, the snowball of feelings begins to roll. Gus has been cancer free for a while now, but attended the support group for his buddy who has cancer-who becomes blind because of it. Gus is very philosophical and poses challenging views and when the thoughts collide with Hazel, it is beautiful. This makes the reader think and question their own beliefs about life, love, and reason.This book is a movie, just out in theaters. There has been a ton of hype around this book on the internet and booktube, so I picked it up. I do have to say that I really did enjoy the story, but I think I would've enjoyed it more if there wasn't so much hype about it-if that makes sense...I did have a couple minor problems with the book, like why Hazel didn't question Gus's feelings enough for me to truly believe everything, BUT it wasn't something that destroyed the 'enjoyability' for me.So, if you like romancy, teen, cry a river stories, read this book! If you're looking for a fresh author with many talents, read this book! If you're not into, or are triggered by cancer, emotional breakdowns, or medical treatment, this book MAY not be for you."
5," just finished The Fault in Our Stars and between all of the hype and the trailer on tv every few minutes, I have conflicted emotions about this book.During the 60's while I was a newlywed Love Story by Erich Segal hit the best seller list for several weeks or maybe months.  Then a movie followed.  I remember crying over the book which I read more than once and also the movie.  The story of a young couple who face the ultimate tragedy really moved me.  Then there was Could Nine by Luanne Rice and many more books and movies which featured young or even older loves thwarted by illness and death.I think The Fault in Our Stars, which is a line penned by Shakespeare was a good book overall, but I had certain problems.  For one every time I read the name Hazel, I though of a maid from TV played by Shirley Booth.  And then Augustus for a guy although Gus wasn't all that bad.  But the bigger problem is that there were passages I had to read over several times to understand and as a former high school teacher, I have to say that most students don't talk this way generally so I'd have to say they were really smart teens.This was not an easy subject even though our child is grown.  I have never made sense of children being so ill and dying before they have really tasted life.  Id di feel by the end of the book, Hazel and Augustus felt fulfilled as if they lived to old age.  Hopefully they will meet on the other side someday."
4," Printz Award winning author, John Green, tells the story of Hazel Grace Lancaster, a sixteen year old girl suffering from terminal cancer.  Her days consist of sitting at home and watching America’s Next Top Model.  Worried that she is becoming depressed, her mother makes Hazel attend a weekly cancer support group.  It is here that she meets Augustus Waters, a seventeen year old cancer survivor who will change everything.  The two share a bond over movies, books, and fellow cancer support group member Isaac, who is left blind after having both eyes removed as the result of cancer.Hazel and Augustus soon build a strong friendship that develops into something more as they continue their battles with cancer.  Their exciting and unique love story consist of great moments together as well as the sorrows of battling a terminal illness.  The story reaches its peak when the pair make an unforgettable trip to Amsterdam to meet Peter Van Houten, the author of Hazel's favorite book, An Imperial Affliction. Throughout the novel Hazel discovers that “some infinities are bigger than other infinities”, and she is determined to make her infinity with Augustus last forever.  This wonderfully written novel presents the difficult and serious topics of illness, death, friendship, and love in an understandable fashion.  The tragic love story between Hazel and Augustus is both believable and heartfelt.  In the end, Green’s novel is beautifully heartbreaking."
4," When I first read this book, I LOVED it! I thought it was so original and clever. I loved Hazel and Augustus both, I loved their dialogue, and I love their love. I'm in the minority in that I didn't shed a tear when I read this nor when I watched the movie. To me, it didn't seem like we were supposed to cry.But recently, I decided to reread this book, and this time I was not as impressed. I can't say I hated TFiOS this time around. I just didn't love it. It was still easy to read, the writing still clever, and the humor still biting. However, this time around I thought Hazel was a bitter brat (especially when she was describing the other members of support group), Augustus creepy, and both of them pretentious. It's also frustrating that they are the same person in different bodies. I know it's romantic, but it gets obnoxious. It's not that I don't like Hazel - she has her caring and redeeming moments, like when the little girl asks about her cannula. I myself even enjoy the occasional America's Next Top Model marathon. But overall, I can't say I want to be friends with either Hazel or Augustus. (I do however want to be friends with Hazel's parents.)I'm still in the minority with those who did not cry, but now I am joining a new minority - those who do not like this book.(For my full review, head over to https://theincorrigiblereader.wordpress.com.)"
4," loved the book when i started reading it. I think they should have took out the Amsterdam, Germany part. I have been to Amsterdam, he didn't put in about the smoking weed part. He briefly said something about the red light district. They were there to enjoy their life and they did nothing fun but go to restaurants. They have cancer so wouldn't it have been good to throw the weed part in there. They drank champagne and no one said no to them. Plus they were more like weird adults, the way the characters talked. The whole Peter Von part was weird. I rooted for them both to live but weirdly Gus died. The parents were a bit concending. They wanted her to have a life then when she started too they complained that they never saw her. John Green should have killed off Hazel. I wanted to see the love story, the real connection. The holding hands in the hospital, the time while he was dying they spent together. I didn't even cry when Gus died because he didn't make it sad enough. I couldn't wait to read this book. i skimmed through all the Germany parts and most of the back home parts because they were boring. Plus Peter coming to see Hazel and she acted like a jerk. Then it ended strange. He sent her stuff that Gus had wrote to him. If John Green would have stopped trying to put in pointless characters then we could have at least knew how Hazel turned out or how she felt about reading the letter.But he has a movie coming out so hopefully that is better."
3, The Fault in Our Stars just got added to my favorite books of all time. I really enjoyed it. I ended up highlighting about 1/4 of the book on my Kindle. I didn't cry nearly as much a I thought I would though.
3," Loved this book. So much raw emotion, and it makes you think about what kind of mark you will leave when you die -how many lives did you impact? The movie just came out 2 days ago, and i can't wait to see it!"
5,"t is a romantic tragedy, but it was the best book I've read so far. I felt so much emotion in this. Not the least bit do I regret getting this book. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did.. It was amazing."
5," This book is absolutely fantastic. Hazel and Augustus' love story is one for the ages - you will not be able to put this one down, and you WILL cry at the end! Cannot wait for the movie - really well written!"
2, Reading is my passion.  There is nothing that I would change about this story...perfection.  I can't even bring myself to write a summary that would be worthy.  This book has changed me.  Well done Mr. Green.
5, Can't wait for the forthcoming film adaptation. That is all.BUT What is with this mandated 20 word minimum review nonsense! Get real Amazon. It's what is said. Not how long it takes one to say it.
5, I read this for just a short read. But on the plane I was in love. With Augustus waters and the book. When Gus died I died too. I cried for 2 hours because I felt a connection with hazel Grace and Augustus.
5, absolutely loved this book! It was such a romantic and cute story for teens. It may be 300 pages but its totally worth it and its a quick read because you get so into the book! Must read for all teen girls!
5," An absolutely gorgeous and insightful read. Really, the only negative thing I could say about the novel is that it might be a little too aware of its own intelligence--but even that is worked to an advantage."
5, Wonderful characters that are wiser than their years - works for me.  A must read.  Green's novels bring you right back into the angst of youth.  Feels as  real as the first go around.Peter Kimbis
5, This book is one that teachers should suggest to their teen students. It is an honest and heartfelt story that deals with the ways in which life is sometimes unfair. Very powerful indeed. Beautifully written.
5," SynopsisHazel spends her time tethered to an oxygen tank and occasionally attending the cancer survivors support group. She may be alive following her battle with lung cancer, but she's not actually living. All of that changes on day when she sees a new guy staring at her in group. Augustus is also a survivor and forces her to change her views on sickness and living.ReviewThis book is sad, I can't really state that enough. As usual, I jumped into this book without reading the description and then spent several hours crying as I made my way through the book. I don't know if I was having an emotional day or if this is seriously the saddest book ever. In my opinion, the emotion that the middle of the book wrung out of me overwhelmed the actual story. I also felt like the last 5th of the book just kind of lost its momentum. There was so much buildup, and then it kind of petered out.The characters are pretty strong and feel like they could actually be real. I also appreciated that there wasn't an immediate love, or any kind of normal love triangle. The reality of the story may lose some of the younger readers that are used to the fluffy paranormal books that are running around today, and that would be a shame. This is certainly the first YA book that I have read in a long time that evoked an emotion.My RecommendationIf you are in need of a good cry, go for it! I give it 3/5 - Good, but not something I would repeat"
5," don't write reviews in an attempt to share details about the book, and I won't do that here.  This is the second time I have read this book and it was just as beautiful the second time!  I NEVER read books through two times, because there are so many books to read.  But, this is worth it.This is a heartwarming story about life and true love.  It is funny and tragic and powerfully deep.  It is the story of a couple finding each other in a cancer support group.  Even though they are young, they find something within each other that many people in this world never get to experience.  They notice things about the world and themselves in it, that many won't even take time to notice.  Even though the book deals with loss, the book in itself deals more with life and living.There is a beautiful part where the girl (Hazel) refers to infinities.  She notes that there are an infinite amount of numbers between 0 and 1. And there is a bigger infinity between 0 and 2 or 0 and 1 million.  And even though some infinities are different sizes, we should all appreciate infinities.  The characters joke that there is no heroism in fighting cancer...they make fun of the notion of getting cancer perks.  It is real, sometimes raw, but all the time eloquent.When I read this book, I went out and read john green's other books.  All of them are good reads, but none are as powerful and beautiful as The Fault in Our Stars."
5," honestly didn't think I was going to cry. I'd prepared myself throughout reading the first half of this book for what I knew was going to happen, and then BAM!!! John Green comes at me from the side and hits me in the temple! The Fault in Our Stars was a good book: well-written, great characters, funny dialogue, sweet love, and of course, true love lost. I must have highlighted half of the book. No joke!I have cried harder reading lesser books. I mean, I think I cried harder when Edward left Bella in New Moon and again when Jacob told Bella he couldn't be her friend. I think I have figured out WHY. Everything in this book is so blatantly honest. We know the characters are victims of cancer, however, they hate being treated as such. They have accepted the inevitable, therefore, the reader also accepts the inevitable. This was a fantastic read, one I would recommend to virtually anyone.Warning: If you are like me and hate stories that do not end in a happily ever after, this book is not for you. I am very much aware of the sadness and unfairness of the world. Reading is an escape from it all and I probably wouldn't have read this book upon scanning the synopsis. My close friend held a gun to my head and made me read and for that I am grateful, if only because I was able to experience Green's amazing writing skills. I am going to go find a happy-go-lucky book now; like Anna and the French Kiss; something a long those lines."
2,t's incredible how this guy got into these teens. I learned a lot. The voices are real and the uncertainty behind cancer is portrayed in a non dramatic way that I found endearing. None leaves life alive :-)
4, The underlying tail of understanding what the universe has in store for you was remarkable. This story made me scared for my own health but with that I would like to add that I guess maybe that was the point
5," this is so tragically intricately depressing,even the book within the book is a tear jerker. do not read this book if u r depressed or hell even having a bad day. with that being said it was an awesome story"
5," This book made me cry, several times. It's such a sentimental book that you can't put down once you've started to read it. I'll never forget the book or the characters. I strongly recommend that you read it."
5," highly recommend this story.  I think it would be especially enjoyed by  teenage girls.  I am definitely older, but loved it anyway.  It is a quick read and an inspirational love story of two, young teens."
5, absolutely love this book! Having a loved one pass away from cancer you kind of have a feeling of what the characters are going through. John Green is an amazing author his writing is absolutely exquisite.
5, promise you this is one of the best books you will ever read I've read it atleast 3 times!It made me cry and will change your outlook on love and life!John Green is just so freaking amazing for this book💕
5, The beauty of this book is in it's characters. They are extraordinary people doing simple things in a world of pain we can't begin to understand. I now have more faith in my ability to read and accept death.
5, Amazing. Filled with words I couldn't understand and had to look up to get the true meaning of what the story was telling Taught me a lot about life and showed me an interesting outlook on the universe
5," know, a story about cancer doesn't sound too exciting, but this book had me laughing more than crying. The writing is flawless, and the characters were so different and real. I couldn't but this book down!"
2," The fault in our stars is a amazing and heartfelt book focusing on living with cancer to find true love, I can't rave enough about this wonderful novel. I recommend this book to any gender over 13 :):):):):)"
5," This is an intelligent, humorous love story that has become one of my favorite books. Please read it now and pass it along.  You'll laugh out loud and and ugly cry, and afterward be so grateful that you did."
5," As a matter of fact, if I didn't have so much to do this evening I would immediately pick it back up and read it all over again. I picked this book up at noon today and finished it at 5:00pm. As I told a friend of mine (as I said be right back, can't talk now), this book grabbed me by the throat and I'm afraid that if I put it down it'll tighten its grip.I am not a teenager, I am a nearly 30 year old woman. It hits home - but what hits home the most is the almost irreverent nature of the book. You can't dance around the issue of cancer when it sleeps in the room next your yours for a while like it did it my house. You have to talk about it. You're not always polite about it. It's a fact of life for a while, just a surely as we all wipe our a**es or clip our toenails. This book does not wrap cancer in a pretty package. This book is not polite.It's raw. It's difficult. It isn't fair. It's *real*.The story is excellent and the writing style is fantastic. It immersed me completely in their world for a little while and finishing it was like coming up for air. The description of the book says everything you need to know about the plot - hopefully this review tells you everything you need to know about whether or not to pick it up.And, as previously stated by many reviewers, bring the tissues. I'm going to go make myself some hot chocolate and try to finish wrapping my head around this book."
5, This book is so heart touching be prepared to awwww one sentence then be crying the next. The quotes that John Green creates are amazing and are really helpful in life. My opinion READ THIS BOOK!!
5, This book is amazing I'm only 13 but this is the best book I've ever read in my life. It nice that the girl finds love . But sad she lost it. But she never thought she find love. You need to read this book.
5, This is the best book I have ever read. The feels are too real and I love it. I wish I knew what they experience and go through. But I don't and hopefully will never have to deal with cancer. Amazing story.
5," Never had I ever read a book so true to the woes of life. If your looking for a happy read, move on. This so beautifully crafted novel will have you rethinking the meaning of life and everything in between."
5," The Fault in our Stars was beautifully written. I fell in love with the relationship of Hazel and Gus. This book had me laughing out loud, then crying silently. I recommend to anyone to seeking a good book."
5," VERY well written and deeply perceptive....One of the best books I have read this year.  Thoughtful, written with excellent care, not an easy subject,  I would recommend this to anyone over perhaps fifteen."
5," loved this book. Great, quick read. Surprisingly addictive. Not crazy about the ending, but overall, fantastic! I could really relate to the characters. I think anyone affected by someone with cancer can."
2, This books came in perfect time. I already read it from someone else and had to have it so others could read it too. It was great that thia copy came just in time for vacation. So I could read it to my wife
5, Good book for teens - my granddaughter asked me to read it.  She loved it and wanted my opinion.  We both weren't too happy with the ending and we texted each other with what we thought would be a good one.
5," At first I assumed this book would be your average cute love story with a cancer twist. It was only so much more than that. I laughed and cried and fell in love with Augustus waters. Trust me, you will too."
5," really can't recommend this book enough, unless your heart is made of ice. It is superbly well-written, full of likable characters and immensely emotional.A real must read for anyone out there"
5, Loved this book. I chose five stars as I found no fault in it. If  I had the opportunity to change anything I wouldn't.I would recommend this book to anyone . Overall brilliant book a must read!
5," loved this book, I fell in love with Augustus; his character, his personality I just love loved him. At times this book was just too depressing with the whole cancer situation but still such a great read!"
5," The Fault In Our Stars, by John Green, is one of those stories that grips and does not let go. My daughter loaned me the book, and in a note indicated that I might want to keep it for a while in case I got “bored”. We also have the movie, but she said I couldn’t watch it until I finished the book.The book was wonderful, one of those that I believe will likely stick with me the rest of my life. It introduces Augustus (my favorite character, by the way), who used his wit and charm to the highest level, in the middle of darkness and despair. It is a story that brings hope in the terrible places of pain, pain, and yes, more pain.I enjoyed the sarcastic wit shared between the friends, smart wit but with the purpose of humor, empathy and love. I also appreciated the realism and the author’s avoidance of the cliché in serious life situations as these.As I neared the end of the book, I began feeling all the inevitable downturn of sadness that comes with stories such as these. My daughter (quite the one for giving excellent advice), said “Dad, just hurry up, rip the scab off and finish the book”. Well, it wasn’t as dark and bleak at the end as it could have been, so there really was no ripping. It was a satisfying ending, filled with optimism and hope.And now I get to watch the movie.I heartily recommend this book to readers across the entire book-loving, genre-reading landscape."
5," This was an exceptionally well written book with so much humor that I read it all in one sitting!  I couldn't stop until I read the whole book and I can't remember how  many times I was laughing out loud at this book!  It was so much fun and emotional and sad and exhilarating all at one time!  I loved the characters and how real they were.  I loved hoping against hope that there would be a happy ending, but so grateful that the author was brave enough to give us the ending that the characters needed.  I love Hazel Grace and wish I was willing to have another child so I could have a little boy that I named Augustus.  Love doesn't care about age and it's ridiculous to think that teenagers can't and don't experience the real, lasting kind of love.  It was so good to see an actual portrayal of what it would feel like to be living with terminal cancer and how different people handle that situation each in their own way.  It made me wonder what kind of Mom I would be if one of my kids was sick and how much I would hope they would get to experience a love like Hazel and Gus had.  It also left me thinking if I were sick what would I want to leave for my kids as an example that they would be able to say, My Mom taught me this...when she was dying...  To me, what makes a remarkable book is how you can take from the characters and see how they will change the way you live your life.  You must read this book...It's that amazing."
5," Loved this book. I think in the future, I will order hard copy books instead of putting them on my kindle. This book ended very abruptly because I wasn't watching the progress bar; I was left wanting more."
5," read this book for discussion with my young teen granddaughter.  It had a lot of heart, showing emotion withoutBecoming maudlin.  Nice to read a book that doesn't rely on sex and profanity to sell."
2," This was a great read.. I could not put this book down.  I cannot wait to see the movie.  It is gives a different picture of cancer from the eyes of teenagers dealing with cancer, home and your first love."
5," This book is truly inspirational and I am hoping that other people will read it. It shows real life situations and doesn't have that cheesy ending that lots of books have. I loved it, I strongly recommend."
5, loved this book. Absolutely loved it. Of course it was sad but it was.... I don't know. Amazing. Probably the best book I've ever read. I loved their promise and I hope I can find my own little infinity.
5," This book is a great way to show that you should be happy with what you have, because you never know when it's going to be taken away.  Powerful writing and a very honest voice from each of the characters."
5," Rarely do I read a book in two days, in this busy world. It would have been even quicker if I didn't have to dry my tears so often. I've read Green's writing before. This is unbelievably good. Go read NOW!"
5," The style·The content·The characters·The emotion. I know I will be reading this book again and again, each time growing more attached to the characters. I publish i I could red it for the first time again."
5," The story was amazing. It wasn't one of those fairytale like stories where everything works out, but it was by far heart warming, and tear jerking. I would recommend this book to, not just to young adults."
5," To frame this review, I must first say that I wasn't itching to read a teen romance. I would imagine that if I had! I would have been utterly propelled by the chemistry that Green paints in this novel. As a background to the romance, however, the existential dilemma of impending  death (and how to respond to it) serves to heighten both the sweetness and the poignancy of the love story. In fact, it is probably a testimony to Green's character development that the only reason it didn't sit with me at the five-star level is because my own approach to mortality and to the cosmic threat of meaninglessness is different from the approach at which the characters arrived. And, (in my likely arrogance and own existential fears), I wished for them to challenge a little further their own ironic detachment from so-called conventional systems of meaning, and from more traditional spiritual approaches to death. But, in this Green stayed  true to a certain type of secular realist approach to death and the world, and in so doing, managed to create profound meaning in gestures of love and sacrifice. Indeed, I found myself completely rooting for these characters, both for their relationship and for their own personal development. I would certainly recommend this to a friend, along with a companion non-fiction work: Ernest Becker's masterpiece, The Denial of Death. The two would make for wonderful dialogue partners."
5," The Fault in Our Stars is such a poignantly written story that my review will not do it justice. This was a book that I had put off reading purely for the fact that I knew it would slay me, and slay me it did. This is the only book I can ever remember making me laugh with joy through tears of sadness. In fact, I don't think I've ever laughed so hard in the middle of a cry like that, ever!Even though I knew what was coming, I was not prepared enough. You need tissues by your side for this one. I fell in love with Augustus just as Hazel did. I loved Isaac too. And I absolutely loathed Peter Van Houten! I gave up caring about Peter and his damn book quite early on, even though I know it was integral to the story it just bugged the hell out of me. Also, I didn't like the fact that these three (Hazel, Gus AND Isaac) seemed to be teenage geniuses and did not speak like anyone I have ever met, especially not anyone that age. In that regard, the story became quite unbelievable, brilliant, but unbelievable.Pushing my annoyances aside, I still loved this book. And it is one I won't ever forget. The amount of highlighted quotes and sections in this book were huge for me. So many great lines and a lot of them were in the banter between the three teens (they were highly entertaining, poignant, intelligent and clever and incredibly insightful). The parents were pretty damn good too. Added to my favourites shelf."
5," Okay ?Okay .  :)Yes , I'm guilty . I'm one of the people who saw the movie before reading the book . I'm one of the people who sat through the credits for a few moments before leaving the theater puffy eyed , still crying and got on the phone to recommend it to friends and family . It took me awhile to regain the courage to buy and read this book . I owned the Kindle Edition but I went to the bookstore and purchased the paperback to have with me everywhere . It was $9 . I bought it and still after reading the first few chapters I didn't finish it not yet . Until today . I read and completed it . Before continuing I told myself I will not be drawn into this beautiful story twice . Nope not me . I will NOT cry again . I did . I thought I'd be one of the few tough ones !This is a love story of two cancer diagnosed teenagers . It covers a very sensitive subject . Not being a fan of young teenage love stories I saw the movie first as previous stated and absolutely loved it . I was blown away . And just now finished this book . It was beautifully written . At certain parts funny . You'll love it too !! Please don't go into this book with the expectation that the movie followed the book exactly . (Some parts very similar but no) . The book is always better than the movie this is no different . Clearly a classic , a favorite . Every person , every teenager should read this book ."
2," really enjoyed reading this book and enjoyed how the writer has written a story within a story that it makes you stop reading to look up where you can find the other fictitious book that is mentioned over and over again throughout the story.This story is about two teenagers whom meet and fall for oneanother in a Cancer support group.  They are so different but more alike than they know.  They are the perfect balance of peanut butter and jelly.  Just when things are getting sweet for the couple they hit an obstacle in their relationship and soon another.  Can their relationship survive the fault within their own star's?  Is it a truly a star crossed love?  If this intrigues you then read it.I did notice a great deal of reviewers criticizing the author for his choice of mature dialect that the teenagers used throughout this book.  Please keep in mind several children and young adults (teenagers) while seriously ill tend to home school and do a great deal of reading because lets face it you can only watch so much television and read so many kiddie books.  Which then tends to broadening the children's horizons and they find themselves reading books that they never thought they would read.  So for this instance, I felt that the usage of language was appropriate between Hazel and Gus, let's face it these two were beyond their ages maturity wise because of the things that they were going through."
5, Cracking through me is tough and that just made me cry so hard. god bless you John green you are a amazing writer please continue. suggestion wise I am telling you to read this book right now it's amazing
4, John Green's writing is spectacularly sarcastic and his dry humor is unmatched. His ability to write as a sixteen year old girl with cancer is miraculous and I hope the movie does his masterpiece justice!
5," J had close to read this book for a class assessment, not far into the book did i realise how much this book was going to effect the way ib looked at everything. John Green has undergone himself yet again"
5," Loved it!! Such a great book. It made me happy and sad in the best way that only great books can! Must read, even if its YA anyone would enjoy this book. It's easy to read but is still written tastefully."
5," loved this book; many of my friends recommended it to me, and I loved it. My parents didn't approve of the language in the book, but other than that, it was a great tearjerker, and just a fantastic book"
5," didn't know what to expect becaise I hadn't read anything explaining what the book was about, just that people loved it. I love it.  So happy I read it and can't imagine anyone not wanting to finish it."
5," am not a YA, I am a middle-aged woman.....but this book was fantastic! Written well for all audiences. The author makes you feel the relationship and the pain.  This is a book I will re-read many times!"
5," Because I just can't stop thinking about it.  Green outdoes even himself here, making myself, a 30-something, question what kind of person I am and the deeper questions of life and my place in this world."
5," absolutely love this book. My friend recommended it for me, and I honestly have to say that I really balked at the idea of romance and the whole idea of the main character having cancer. Then I stumbled on John and Hank Green's youtube channel and, consequentially, nerdfighterria. I thought it was brilliant, and then I discovered that it was the same John Green. By this point, I was getting a little intrigued about reading TFiOS, but I had  too many other books that I had already started and demanded my attention. Once I saw the video of himself reading the first chapter that John Green posted on his channel, however, I immediately checked the price for the e-book. It was $3.99. I bought it and I have no regrets. I loved the characters, the plot was romantic without being slutty, and the pacing was perfect. I absolutely love the writing style, too. I totally recommend it to anyone. Just as long as they read the last, like, half at home with a bunch of Kleenexes. That's why I titled this review the way I did: When I was about 70% through it, I was reading before I went to bed. I looked at the clock once; it was eleven p.m.. I looked at the clock again; it was 1 a.m. and I had finished. There were tears streaming down my face and if I had been in public when I read it, people would have stared at me like I was a psychopath. Trust me, I've finished sad books in public before. Not something I would like to do again...."
2," This book took me less than 10 hours to read, and I must say it was probably some of the best hours of my life! 5 star book all the way! I literally (as Gus would say) felt these two teens pain throughout the entire novel. John Green is an evil genius who knows how to tug on your heart strings and make you fall in love with two fictional characters. Hazel and Gus had the most epic whirlwind romance. Starting out as mere strangers and ending as best friends, girlfriend/boyfriend, lovers, and most of all each others salvation. How do you ask did the save each other? Well Hazel had felt like she was a ticking time bomb, a grenade, to anyone who cared for her until she met Gus and fell in love. Gus was saved by being able to feel true love from someone who wouldn't pity him because of his missing leg and knew what he has suffered. This novel is a great love story with dare I say, a s***ty ending that had me bawling my eyes out at page 256 and nothing entirely to sad had happened yet. I would love to tell you what this novel is about but I feel it would ruin it. A novel this beautiful needs to be read first hand without being told what it's about. I decided to read this book after seeing the end of a preview for the movie not knowing what any of it was about, but knowing I wanted to see the movie. I recommend you read this before you see the movie. It made me look forward to sitting in the uncomfortable theater chairs."
5,"t was toats rad bruhhhh! I would read this book over and over again on my surfboard in the ocean. I would read this book surfing those gigantic waves, or fighting that huge monkey in the African Jungle."
5," haven't been so engrossed into, or at least for some time. Great read that takes unexpected turns and had me in tears. Most books can not do that to me. Will check out the other books from John Greene."
5,"t was an amazing book the pain is worth it. It speaks the truth and tells an amazing story. I love it so much and I recommend it to anyone 11 or over. It is worth the time, pain, and love of John Green."
5," A great interpretation of the corny love story Beautifully written. Many meaningful quotes. Explores love, death, and sickness in a very poetic way. I loved it and would definitely recommend it"
5," Absolutely loved this book!! Definitely have to have tissues handy when reading this, but well worth it. It is an amazing story that I think anyone could appreciate. Well worth the time and money!!!!!!!!"
5," This book is so... Amazing. Although I'm sure  one cannot imagine the heartache or struggle that comes with an awful disease such as cancer, this book does an impeccable job at capturing the raw emotion."
5,ts so good. I never knew a book could make me feel all the emotions that the characters felt! John Green is an excellent writer. This is one of my favorite books. Words can't describe how awesome it is!
5," This is an amazing book, it's my favorite John Green book by a long shot.  It's well written and it will make you luagh and cry, I read it in a day and as soon as I finished it I wanted to read it again."
5," John Green has officially revolutionized this era of writing. His writing almost makes you feel more sophisticated, or like you now have not more knowledge only because of the fact that you read his book. This book had an unexpected turn of events that left me crying. Now keep in mind that I am not a crying  person. I've  only cried after Marley and Me, The Hunger Games, and one of the books from the Maximum Ride series. I was weary about reading this book because I usually don  like  reading cancer books for the same  reason Hazel didn't like what people were saying on Augustus`s wall. But Mr. Green had enough sense to realize this. Undoubtedly because Green is an amazing and intelligent man. Not only when he has his Author Cap on, but also when he is doing  his History Crash Course videos on YouTube. I am going to bring this review to a close before I give away the climax or the ending or start getting all boring and nostalgic on you fellow readers. So my final statement is: read this  book and try not to cry.P.S. If any other authors or future authors are still reading this (congrats:)) I'll give you  a tip: if you want your book labeled as a National Tear Jerked, just add a heartfelt message from a removed character-. Oops.... I just gave away the ending.... sorry!Live life  to the fullest because others would give anything to do just that.  Okay,  Joy Mason  14 yrs."
2," This book is one of my favorite books. Coming from someone who doesn't really read, this book really got to me. It made me feel and have sympathy for the characters. This amazing book was about two lovers that both battle with cancer. They are young teens that fight everyday for their lives. They eventually fall in love. Later on, we'll find out what Hazel Grace really saved her 10 for. This book is a romantic tragedy. The moral of the story is really living and loving life to the fullest because we never know what will happen. Cancer patients are fighters and are not mistakes. They are not responsible for their illness. The book does not compare to the movie at all. If you really read the book carefully, it is really easy to pick out the differences the movie portrays compared to the book. You can probably read this book over and over again and never get bored and will never lose the feeling the author sets for his readers. This was a brilliant book and highly recomended for all people of all ages. The reason why I gave this book five stars is because being a teenager, this is the perfect love story. Every teenage girl wants something like this to happen to them. This book is very relatable and understandable. The author puts an image in his readers minds while reading what's happening in the story. The Fault in Our Stars is definitely a must read and will not be a dissapointment."
5," When I started reading this book I didn't realize that it was a teen book. However it was good so I kept with it. The basic premise; teen with terminal lung cancer meets in remission teen at support group and they begin a romantic relationship that is built around their love of books. I won't say more and spoil the outcome for you.What makes this book great is the writing. Its very intelligent and witty and captures teenagers as they actually are, rather than two dimensional vampire book constructs. A little bit swearing, a little bit sexy, insecure, just like the real deal. The reality of dealing with cancer day to day adds another dimension. What makes it unique is that the adults in the story are also captured in a very real way, unlike some books where they are simply place holders around the young story line.There are some heavy topics in there. Death, of course. But also, some sophisticated concepts like existentialism. My eleven year old (a very mature reader) wanted to read this and I told her she needed to wait a couple of years more, not because of the sexy bits (although that is a valid point) but because the ideas were a bit big for her brain just yet.In summary, a great read. I do not, repeat, do not like those syrupy romantic cancer type stories, and this is not one of those. Real and gritty, and written with true heart rather than movie of the week sentiment."
5," This book stayed with me for days and days. I cried and laughed many times. When I finished the book, I found myself wanting to instantly read it again. Nothing like I've read, but on my favorites list."
5," have a 14 year old daughter that would rather have her cell phone taken away than to read a book, but this book she could not put down!  She really enjoyed it and it took her no time at all to finish!"
5, The fault in our stars is such a great book John green did amazing it made me laugh cry and look back on my life and be thankful and also wonder if I'm using my life to the best of my abilities loved it
5," This book affected me so much. It taught me about love, heartbreak, struggle, overcoming sadness, happiness, and life. I can't stop thinking about this book an if you haven't read it, please, please do."
5," am not convinced that your average teenager is capable of operating on such a high level but of course these aren't average circumstances. Heart rendingly, beautifully written, I couldn't put it down."
5, An exquisite story of love and loss. The fault in our stars is exactly what this book is about. The love of these two is what we can only hope to experience just once in our lives. Beautifully written..
5," laughed, I cried, and I read it in two days. This book can make you really think at times while also entertaining you and presents cancer in a realistic way that's at times lighthearted and emotional."
5, This is without doubt the best book i've ever read! I love the characters and i simply love everything about this book! I love the all the meaningful quotes and I highly recommend this book to everyone!
2," There are no words to accurately describe this book. It was absolutely wonderful, well-written and chillingly sad. This novel makes me appreciate my life and notice the beauty in the world and universe."
5," This book is beautiful in many, many, ways. The characters are amazing, the story drags you in, and all in all it is one the most fantastic books I have ever read. I would highly recommend it to anyone."
5,"m not going to laminate about the prose of this book, or the plot, or even the brilliance of John Green...all of that has been done, so instead, I want to take this opportunity to address some of the concerns that have been mentioned in other reviews: The characters.It is true, Gus (Augustus) and Hazel (Hazel Grace) are older than their age, which can be a bit jarring if you're expecting to read a book about our over-indulged, over-spoiled youth. Gus and Hazel speak throughout the pages with voices older then they chronologically are, but that is a side-effect of dying, which is a side-effect of cancer. So, no, we're not dealing with children who fill their days with homework assignments and gossip...we're dealing with children who live in a very adult world where their have faced their own mortality and address it the way anyone would--with grace, humor, practicality and hope. They are authentic both in their blood and bone, and their grief of accepting which is, to us, unacceptable -- their own deaths.The point is this: They simply and wholly live on different plane. So we cannot read them the way we read Bella and Edward, or Katniss and Peta, their other YA contemporaries when it comes to star-crossed lovers. If you do, undoubtably you will be in for a culture shock. They don't live in an otherworld, we are the ones, in this case, that live in an otherworld."
5," might be in the minority here, but this book isn't as great as all the hype made it out to be.I like it.  Overall, the book reminds me of books like 'Catcher in the Rye' or 'Perks of Being a Wallflower', only with a girl that has cancer... which makes her complaints and overall depressing outlook justified.Cancer is a touchy subject for a lot of people. I found this book a little lacking on the dark cancer front.  It went from a girl with cancer, to a flirtation story, to an adventure to meet someone story, to a love story, back to the cancer to end the book.I found myself enjoying the adventure part of the story more than any other part.  I step back from this book and ask myself, could this have worked without the cancer aspect.  It definitely could have, but would it have been as good or eye catching... most likely not.I'll say again... cancer is a bad thing, but as far as this book goes... I think cancer was used as a touching point to get people talking about this book and eventually having people read it since they heard so much about it.This book had the chance to observe a few people with a disease that can really make a person feel like less of a person.  It could have went to a dark place and observed some of the truths within cancer, but instead it decided to focus on a love story and visiting an author to try to talk about a book."
5, started this book and set it aside after the first couple of chapters because I wasn't sure that it was a topic I wanted to deal with. I came back to it after a month or so and am glad I finished it.
2," My book club read this and we discussed the characters thoroughly. The author really captured the teen age spirit. He also reflected their love, anxiety and bitterness for the terrible disease, cancer."
4, fell in love we the characters mostly Augustus.  i also found myself crying A LOT at the end of the book but over all best and saddest book i ever read.  has a super sad ending though ugh the pain...
5," What a fabulous, sad, uplifting book! The characters (not just Hazel and Gus) are so well drawn, so real. You read, knowing what you will find at the end... but what you find that you've found is love."
5, That book was amazing. I'm kind  crying right now. If he ever makes a sequel. I'll buy it. It was just an amazing experience  to add to my collection an  I just loved it. Especially isaac and Augustus.
5," John Green has quickly become one of my favorite authors, and this book is definitely one of my favorites. Clever writing, easy to read and so addicting I just had to finish the whole thing is one day."
2," Although I still believe Looking For Alaska is his best, this is a powerful and complex novel, more than worth the time and money; nobody makes me care about fictional characters quite like John Green."
5, didn't put this book down once until I was finished and even then I kept searching for something more because it was so beautiful that I wish there wasn't an ending. No ending would have been perfect
5, My daughter and I are both fan's of John's books.  This is probably my favorite of his.  It was my daughter's favorite book ever for a whole 3 months which is a big deal if you knew how much she reads.
5," This book was a very difficult read for me. A dear friend of mine just passed away from osteosarcoma so this book really hit home for me. Nonetheless, it was beautiful. Definitely my new favorite book."
5, This is a fantastic book--could not put it down.  It was funny and it made me cry.  It's labeled Young Adult lit but it's for everyone and it's written on such a high level that adults can love it too.
5, thought that this book was amazing. While it was very sad it was beautifully written and very funny. I really wish that this book was a million times longer! I highly recomend it to teens and adults.
5, was a fan of John Green after reading Looking for Alaska. I decided to try out this book and I immediately fell in love with the story. I highly recommend this book as well as all of his other books.
5, can honestly say that this book is the best book I have ever read. A beautiful story that has such deep meaning yet so much humor and life to it. I think everyone should read this book. End of story.
5, read this in the midst of pondering the pros and cons of children having it skip much of what we have grown to think of as the extended adolescence necessary in much of privileged US popular culture.
5, Young adult in the hospital.  It's a story that very well could be true (except the very big words and silly talk) but indeed a great story of how love can change the course of a young persons disease.
2," A must read! Had me in tears and I don't cry over books, but this wonderful story was so well written that I felt every emotions the characters felt. I highly recommend you read this outstanding story."
5," This book had me laughing out loud in one paragraph and in tears the next.  Although it is in the young adult category, I never felt like it was meant for an audience several decades younger."
5," This book made me cry through a half of a box of tissues. Having known and loved a family member who lost the battle with cancer that was made of him, this novel is a great comfort.For young persons going though loss, this is a fantastic insight into the lives we don't usually get to see. When cancer patients don't identify as people dying of cancer, they're people living. Hazel is an emotional immature 16 year old who is too book smart for her own good. Augustus is a confident young person who refuses to let cancer control his life. They meet at a support group that doesn't seem supportive. They bond over literature, both life changing and deplorable novels. The need for immediacy isn't noticed for a little while, until you understand that the one who has been told she will not survive her cancer, outlived one who is told is I'm remission.People with cancer live, love and laugh just as much as people who are cancer-less. John Green wrote this about his experience in a children's cancer hospital, and it is evident he took the time and patience to notice and care about more than the patients dealing with their diagnosis.This novel will bring you to tears time and time again. They're worthy tears, knowing that there are kids with cancer who love freely and don't get hung up on who they're afraid to hurt. And there are people who will always remember those who they love, pain or not."
5," Well, this is a book about kids with cancer. Or snarky, intelligent, extremely self-aware teenagers with cancer, I should say. I mean, this is a John Green book after all.Here's the short version: cancer girl Hazel meets cancer survivor Augustus at a cancer kid support group, they fall in love and talk about death and morality and stuff. There is also a sub-plot about tracking down the reclusive Dutch author of a book about a teenage girl with cancer. But mostly there's a lot of talking.I think John Green does a great job of putting the reader in the shoes of someone fighting cancer. Hazel and Augustus spend a lot of time demolishing the cliches that surround Kids With Cancer.That said, there's not a lot going on here. We know how this kind of story ends (spoiler: someone dies) and the mystery to be solved is not that compelling. Also, Green has taken the character trope of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl and managed to turn that character male. The name of that character is Augustus Waters. Hazel and Isaac (another cancer kid) I found believable. Augustus I did not.Overall, I'd rate this book as Just Okay. It's kind of heavy in places, and it does a good job of giving us the perspective of someone with cancer, but it's light on plot and it's not particularly revelatory.If you want to read John Green at his best, check out Paper Towns instead."
5," never would have chosen this book.  I despise crying, I am not a romantic and just the brief description of this book tells you that both of these things are inevitable.  However, I am a member of a book club and one of the things I enjoy about it is being forced out of my comfort zone.This was a completely enthralling story despite my best efforts to loathe it.  Although it is categorized as YA, it was superbly written with some very real observations put forth in such a lovely combination of words that I stopped several times to reread the passage and, yet, still flew through it in record time.  In fact, I copied the introduction to my book club before even starting Chapter 1 because it held such thought-provoking  meaning. That being said, don't skip the intro!I love the reality of these characters.  I love their humor, their wit, their feelings, their life and, yes, even their mortality.  Without the hardships they face they wouldn't have been the same.  And since they are only fiction, I must say that without the hardships they face they wouldn't have been written and I wouldn't have been just slightly changed, for the better, after having read their story.Of you are a romantic, read this book.  If you are into drama, read this book.  If you like realism, read this book.  If you are suffering or healthy, a parent or a child, if you just love good writing, read this book."
3,"ve read other Green novels with mixed feelings, but I really liked this novel most.I struggle with these books because sometimes I find Green's characters a bit unrealistic. You have perfect Alaska who is allegedly so smart and beautiful and funny, but is a tragic mess... But the only indication we have of her intelligence is a few comments she makes in class. Then, there is Margo and she is this perfect person who doesn't care what anyone thinks, but spends her whole life having the privilege of beauty and money. They just seem so... annoying, honestly.But, this is so much better. Yes, it still has bit of the cliche descriptions you would expect to see for this genre. However, it is much more down to Earth. Green still manages to throw in a big, existentialist theme, but given the context, it is much more warranted. Moreover, he takes a fresh perspective on cancer, this word and disease we have all grown too familiar with, which is unexpected, but incredibly poignant. It definitely makes you re-think how individuals with the diagnosis approach life and death. Most importantly, the death in the book seems much more real than his comparable novels. I think that is what makes this book stand out from the others; it is inherently more realistic and truthful. From the flawed characters to the thematic representations, it is much more life-like than others. Worth the read."
5," chose this to read this book after seeing the movie(I know, how original). Thought it was very well written and it made us as readers fall in love with the characters. Not your average cancer novel."
4, cried like a baby... in the best sort of way. This story has the amazing ability to take you through a heart breaking journey in the most uplifting way. I can't put into words how much I enjoyed it.
4," Loved the writing and story, hated the disease.  The characters were likable, humorous, strong and the feelings that were portrayed were very thought provoking.  I couldn't put it down.  A great book."
5," cried, I laughed and I mourned through this whole entire book. I received the book after 3 days of purchasing it and finished it in another 3 days. Definitely a book I would recommend to my friends."
2,"t's going to take a great deal more than a sleeve and two Oreos to get over this book. I have read it twice now in four days, and it was even greater the second time! I also cried twice. That is all."
5," Make sure you have tissues and a good long time to read because you won't want to stop.  The story itself makes it a 5-star read, but when you really get into the characters the message is incredible."
5," Loved this book!  Although sad at times, there was always an air of hope.  Reminiscent of Silver Lining Playbook with characters who deal with their challenges in their unique off-beat ways."
5," Green's book pulls no punches.  Though written about (and I believe, for) young adults, it will resonate with and move anyone over twelve, especially if he/she is looking for a loving dose of realism."
5," am not saying I did not enjoy this book because I did.  However, I personally found the characters hard to relate to, not because  they were sick but because they did not act like typical teenagers."
5," Like stated above in the title, . I have absolutely no words to describe this book with. It was by far one of the best reads I have ever read. I strongly suggest this to anyone who can pick up a book."
3, My husband died of cancer five years ago so was I up for a story about living and dying with cancer...not so much. Glad I read it anyway because now it is one if my favorite books I've read this year.
5, always judge as book by how much I cry....... I'm as hopeless romantic always have been.... and let's just say I cried like as baby.... I also like how witty the dialog was keeps you wanting more!!!
5," loved this book!  It was a very quick read, in spite of the heavy topic.  The characters were engaging and funny and quirky and sad all in one breath.  I will read more of this author in the future."
5, This was one of the best books I've read in a while. It was beautiful. What is best is it really makes you think when you're done. This was a beautiful piece of art and b I'm so glad I got to read it!
2," Wow. What an amazing book. I've always believed that a book that can make me connect so profoundly with its characters that I cry when tragedy befalls them is a remarkable book written by an amazing author. This book is that and so much more. It is about young cancer patients; two in particular, and their journey. It's about life, love, happiness, sadness, and ultimately death. The honesty of these characters, and the brutality of the disease, made me realize that we healthy people often take our blessings for granted. It reminded me to be more appreciative of each and every moment. As a parent, I can so relate to the parents in the story, and their love for their children. It's a love that knows no boundaries; that's unconditional; a love that will carry on throughout eternity.I absolutely fell head-over-heels, madly in love with Augustus Waters. Everyone should be so blessed as to have a Gus in their life. Hazel Grace and I would've been friends. I will carry these two characters with me for a long time. There's a story-within-the-story here, about another book and author. I had to Google them to see if they really exist. Mr. Green is THAT convincing. This is my first John Green novel but it most definitely won't be my last.Please, if you read nothing else, read this book. It's that good. I'm just sorry I only have 5 stars to give it because it deserves many more."
5," The Fault in Our Stars is definitely a book that most people have heard of because of the ever so popular movie, or the popularity of the book itself in the first place. However, after reading it for the first time myself, I would have to say that there is definitely a reason that it is so widely read. It is about reality in a lot of ways. The reality of a girl dying with cancer, and her struggles along with a gorgeous romance that boldly comes in from the beginning with a boy named Augustus Waters. What keeps the audience on their toes is not just the relationship between these two youngsters, or the anxiety of not knowing when someone will abruptly pass away or not, but for myself, it would be the complete rawness of the main character, Hazel, and how she sees the world—a place of lost hope and dreams, the opposite of most stories you hear in the media about a smiling, hopeful girl with cancer. It is the reality that opened my eyes. The characters to me, seem quite real, which is not what I experience reading in all books. The last pages are now slightly crinkled and deformed because of the endless tears from my face that are now dried up. But I would read it again in a heartbeat, because I learned so much about life, death, truth, experience, and so much more. Although, heart-breaking, I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is ready to view life in a different perspective."
5," All I can say about this book and John Green is that he (it) will tear you apart. As a young writer I look up to Green and can only hope my work will be half as good as his.  On a different note The Fault In Our Stars is amazing. It only gets better the more you read it.( I cried when I first read it. And, I cried when more the second and third.) The sarcasm and witt will make you want to laugh until your stomach hurts. This story is told as truthful as most teens see the world (I should know for I am one.) I can only agree with Gus 'My thoughts are stars I cannot fathom into constellations'.  I can guarantee one day this book will be considered a classic. And, one day when the people of my generation are old, walking/rolling around in wheel chairs and diapers our grandchildren will discuss this book. We will remember it as one of the greatest love stories of our time. One of the sickest love stories of our. And, it will bring some of us to tears. I have words to describe how amazing this book is. If you haven't read it and are thinking about doing so there isn't really a choice. Read the book.  (But, just so you know get comfort food, tea, tissues, fuzzy socks, comfortable pj's and a blanket. The feels in this book are extreme. I almost drowned in my own tears the three times I first read it in 2013.)  Thanks John Green (Even though what you did was unacceptable.)"
5," guess all the hype is coming from the teenagers.  This book is seriously, just ok.  The storyline is ridiculously predictable.I'm really amazed at some of the books that are made into movies."
5," wow, this is the most inspiring book I've ever read. It's the most fantastic, inspiring, beautiful, and well rounded books I've ever read. It perfectly captures the ideal of love, it's amazing... (':"
3, saw someone tweet about this book and say they really liked it. I started reading it and thought I knew how the story would unfold. I am glad I stuck with it and finished the book. Time well spent.
5," This was the first book EVER I have read cover to cover, and in a day in a half. This book will change your view on things. I cried the entire time and realized how fantastic it is. I love this book."
5," This book was amazing, enthralling, full of life and humor.  In the face of such sadness for a writer to be able to express joy without it being unreal and cheesy is pretty incredible.  A great read."
5, loved the quick wit of the characters. It has been an extraordinarily long time since a book has made me laugh and cry with such regularity. I also believe that my vocabulary improved dramatically.
5, absolutely loved this book and the characters in it. It will make you laugh and cry. There are some lines that I wish I could remember forever . A book worth reading. It's a fast easy read as well.
2," To understand what all the hype is about. Yes..it was sad. I cried a little, because dying is sad, especially if it is children dying...but this book just didn't flow for me, and I believe it's because there were characters half my age using words and language too big for them. I'm not an unintelligent person, nor have I ever been, even at that age, but I never in a conversation spoke like the characters in this book. Written, maybe, but never while talking to live people.My other issues (spoiler alert) are...she spends the better part of the book obsessed with how her book ended and wanting to know what happens...I understand this concept. She realizes that when you die, the story just ends...you don't get too find out what happens to your friends, your family, your hamster (or at least, if you do not believe in an afterlife, as she does not)...so I accept her obsession with finding out an ending..knowing she will face her own end soon.And then she just stops caring, and calls the author it for being self important and using big words....even though she and her friends talk in a manner that no teenager on earth uses...finally...it just ends. No resolution. If she had died, like the book within the book, that would be one thing...I guess I was just excluding more. Especially in a book made into movie that people go on and on about. I guess I just don't get it..."
5," loved this book.  My daughter loved this book, my best friend loved this book.  Only read it when you have some time, as you wont be able to put it down!  Also have plenty of tissues at the ready!"
2," am not sure if John Green knows exactly what goes on inside a 16-year-old girl's head, but whether it's exactly accurate matters not.  The dialogue is energetic, humorous, thoughtful and poignant."
5, Could NOT put it down! Loved it from the first word to the last. Ironic/funny that he kind of does the same thing to his readers than what that Dutch writer does to Hazel. I kind of expected it. :-)
5, This book was an awesome Heart felt book i love reading books about love. I usually don't read books with sad endings but this sad ending had a twist you didn't expect. I just wanna say AWESOME BOOK
5," loved this book. Best one I have read in a while. One of those where you sob and wish you could change the story, but you know if you did, it wouldn't have been as good. Highly recommend the read!"
5, love books that are written like this. They both know they already like each other and the whole book is spent on them being together not chasing after each other. I also love the bursts of humor.
5," Absolutely fantastic book.  I couldn't put it down, so once I finished it, I read it again.  By far my favorite book of the year.  Lets hope the movie version does it justice.  It's a gorgeous read."
5, Heartfelt and serious is how I would describe this book. It makes you aware of all the pain of losing someone no matter of how much time you spend with them.Read it. You won't be disappointed.
5," One of the best books I've ever read. Powerful, smart, funny and sad it would be a crime  to have a chance to read this book and not read it. Do yourself a favor and indulge in this brilliant story."
5," A book about a terrible decrease which almost always ends badly. Yet this book is about teenagers who happen to have cancer, but are regular teenagers. Sad topic, not a sad story. Gives perspective."
5," Not just for teens. Even though you know this book with have it's sad moments, the author does a great job taking the focus off illness and onto youth and the vibrancy of living the life you choose."
2," This book has ruined my life.Literally, for two days after completing this book I was sad and angry at John Green. I don't even know what the dude looks like but I was furious at him for constructing such an instrument of emotional torture. I get that this was supposed to be real and meaningful and give us a sense of purpose in the pain and loss of young life from a realistic view. I get that Augustus dies because that's just how cancer works and Hazel was all sad about it and it was terrible, but at the end she realizes that she was lucky to have loved him and because of that relationship, among the others that he had his life had meaning and purpose. And because of his contribution to others they were in turn able to contribute positively to their loved ones and into perpetuity.I totally understand all of that. And it's beautiful, but it also makes me cry and want to hug my children and want to call up people that I haven't talked to in forever and just connect with this once more. So it's a good novel I guess because it challenges you to think and is moving in a way that makes it a worthwhile read.But it also made me cry, and I dislike crying. A lot. I also strongly dislike that he chose someone so likable to kill in order to make his point. But I guess that is the point, in a way.Read at your own risk, folks. And bring tissues."
5," Amazing! I absolutely loved this book. It was so charming, heart-warming, real, and at times really funny. I couldn't put it down. I was a little nervous at first when the main character, Hazel, began speaking because she sounded like a typical teenager and I didn't want to be stuck reading another dime-a-dozen mindless teen drama book but this was far from that. This book really hit home for me and at times I found it difficult to read for the simple fact that my father was diagnosed with the same type of cancer as Hazel and struggled with some of the same problems. It was an unforgettable experience reading from Hazel's point of view as I often found myself wondering if my father felt this way before he passed on last year. I cannot stress enough how real this book is, no outlandish schemes, no far-fetched hard to swallow occurrences, nothing like that. Not too lovey-dovey but not dry either so if you're a guy and you're worried about this being a sappy chick novel, never fear, this book is VERY gender-neutral. The love that Hazel and Augustus share is a short-lived one but beautiful all the same. You don't need to spend 80 years with someone to create a beautiful love story. For sometimes star-crossed love is the loveliest of them all. Long story short, this book is nothing short of an instant classic must read and I would recommend it to anyone. Young, old, guy or girl."
4,m in my 30s and enjoyed this book immensely. It is a young adult but the story resonates with everyone. It is an extremely quick read but that doesn't take anything away from the beautiful story.
5," thought this book was amazing!!! It was really well written. I would recommend this book for anyone to read, even though it has some sad parts:(  this is now one of my favourite books of all time"
5," Fault is an excellent read, especially for those lucky ones who, like myself, are, for the time being, cancer survivors. Fault provided me with new perspectives about life and livingyour life"
5, love this book because of the honesty in it. The humanity of the characters and the reality of their love and mistakes. And the beautiful balance between Hazel and Gus. How real it all really is.
4," So, I bet you are saying Hey, you are not supposed to read this book!!!!!11! I don't care! I have read A LOT of books in my life. This book made me cry and it is still the best book ever created!"
5," was sort of apprehensive when I started this book, because I am a cancer survivor.  I absolutely loved this book.  The stories of the individuals were well written.  I highly recommend this book!"
5," This is a really fast read but such a thought-provoking one. I really enjoyed the characters and thought that the plot was pretty captivating. It may be a young adult book, but this adult is a fan!"
5," would recommend this book to just about anyone. It's not a love story, it's not a cancer story, it's the story of a few people (like everyone else) who have a few faults in their stars."
2," Such a great story!For the first time ever I cry reading the book.Characters are great and even that they are only teens, it feels like they are grown ups.Writing is just amazing!"
5," Great Book  I read this book even knowing the subject and I would cry – I don’t usually read books I know will be sad, but my 13 year old daughter was reading it and asked me to read it so we could discuss the book.  Well I started crying on page 200 and didn’t stop for a few days after I finished- I was not able to discuss the book without crying for over a week.  The thought of the book makes me tear up still- I will not be seeing the movie.That said- I have to say that the book is well written and flows well.  The story was gripping and real along with sweet and beautiful all at the same time.  I loved the relationship between Hazel and Gus, they both knew how important it was to grab on to each day and live it to its fullest.  The descriptions of these two drinking champagne made me feel I was with them enjoying the evening, intimacy, food and the view.The subject is a sad one, but this book is well worth reading even with the tears-sobs actually at one point.  Life is short and for some shorter than it should be – cancer is not fair – life is not fair – this book will make you think about how you are living your life and the wasted time you need to take back so you have no regrets at the end – life ends for all of us at sometime – live it now!!!That is the message I got for this book – if you don’t mind tears then read this book."
5,"m sorry but everyone kept telling me that the ending was so good and nothing I expected. I mean it was okay, I didn't particularly like it but I guess that's life, but I did know someone was gonna die like that's so obvious. And I didn't cry at his book once tbh and everyone made this book a bigger deal than it actually was. It was a really good book I admit but everyone made it sound like god wrote it and every word was gold. But that's not the case. And I'm not trying to be mean or whatever but I think everyone made a big deal about it bc they had cancer. Which contradicts what john green is trying to say. He said he didn't want people with cancer to be treated differently yet here people are, adoring this book for all the wrong reasons. Most people don't even get the deep meaning behind the book, they just like it bc they have cancer and that's sad and Gus dies. But if ur deep you understand that the reason Gus died is bc he's a hero but backwards. Throughout the book Gus talks about leaving a mark and a scar in the world so I won't be forgotten. And usually a hero startes out weak and then gets strong. But bc of Gus' metaphors and thinking on life he has to do the process backwards. He starts off strong and healthy but gets weaker and weaker and dies bc that's what he needs to do in order to reimagine and define his definition if a rich and life-worth-living life."
5," This book came so highly recommended that it was a disappointment for me. Although I could emotionally connect with the main characters and felt for them,  the writing style itself was not for me."
3," really didn't enjoy reading this book. I bouhht into the same hype with 50 shades of grey. HIS STYLe is nothing extraordinary, and the fate of the min characters was very predictable ."
3, Very good book.  It is sad though. It does paint a perfect picture of what cancer patients as well as her entire family goes thru trying to treat this terrible disease.  Wold recommend this book .
2, This was a great book. However I am disappointed with the teenage sex. It could have been a beautiful teenage love story without promoting teenage sex. Other than that this was an excellent novel!
5, My friend Rebecca thought I would like this book so I read it. Every time I asked her what would happen to Gus and hazel Grace should would say I do Augustus I do and I didn't understand now I do.
3, knew that it was going to be sad. But it was only as heartbreaking as it was because I was genuinely attached to the characters. Read the last 20% only around people who have seen your ugly cry.
5," You would not think that a story about terminal children would be beautiful or funny.  This book is both ... simply magical.  I cried, laughed, and cried some more.  Oddly enough, it gave me hope."
2," enjoyed this book.  It is a heartbreaking love story: Young romantic love, love shared between parents and their children, and love shared between friends .  The character development is superb."
5," This book was absolutely beautiful. I found myself crying in the car with my father and my two best friends sobbing uncontrollably. They're love, though fictional, was so real. Highly recommended."
5," read this book because it was my girlfriend's favorite. I never really read that often, but after she passed away, I decided to read it and it is by far my favorite. I would recommend to anyone."
5," loved this book!!! I could not put it down. It made me think, made me smile, made me laugh and made me cry. I can not wait to read all of John Green's Green's stories. Amazing, amazing, amazing."
5, This book was very well written and I didn't expect the end to end the way it did. One thing I really like about this book it wasn't predictable and its pretty realistic and I absolutely loved it.
5, was not able to put this down! It's a great story and it's weird because I am not one to gravitate towards books about young teenage love but this was so much more than that. Thank you Tumblr ;)
5," This book, although about something very serious is heartfelt, witty, honest, sad, thought provoking and romantic all smushed together. John Green is wonderful, and this is definitely a must read!"
5," Wonderful story about friendship, love, and connection in the face of hardship, terminal illness, and death. Well written, engaging style with plenty of opportunities for reflection. A must read!!"
5,"ll forget the review questions promptly after this first statement. Okay.The lies of life are so soft and simpering in kind, so often we have such desperation for the truth that we forget that we construct lies to suit fictions, instead of to dull truths. Death is never so fair a subject to lie about... But it is a lie to ignore, and a jagged truth to address: one that leaves such ragged lies in its wake as we progress infinitely towards the finite termination of identity.The existentialist in myself without a qualm, agrees.But truth is not the subject of this story, no more than a story can be a sentence and the verb to that sentence, a lie. Factually, encompassing a story with a word is plainly sophomoric, to both live and fictional subjects: so, naturally, I will love this story as an unambiguous dagger in my heart. Just a passing glance, but if any reader of mine have truly felt a passing touch to the heart sharply, I will assume none walked away unscathed by battle. And investment in the truth of that physical blade aside, I am invested in the metaphors of this book, and left to ponder my frail lies as they stream now softly from the curtain rods in my soul.I'll pass this stony hearted fool by in a short infinity, but you offered my whole self a review, whomever you are.And he hopes you chose wisely, in you endeavor of this story."
5," Read this book for book club.  Glad I did.  I definitely had a connection with the book.  My sister died of ovarian cancer almost six years ago.  I cried because I went through her cancer with her....especially, I was crying for those last few weeks of her life.  It wasn't pretty; it wasn't fun; it wasn't comforting.... She did get to say her good-byes...much like Gus needed to have his friends write his eulogy.  He needed to hear it; they needed to say it.  That was difficult for me because my sister had asked me to write her obituary for her.  Not just write it, but she wanted me to read it to her to get her approval!  Yikes!  That's when I sobbed the most with this book--when they were sharing their eulogies with Gus!  I'm sure it was meant to be comforting to him.  I've not read any of John Green's other books, but I might try another one.  I liked his writing style.  I was a little disappointed because there were some language concerns that would keep this book out of the classroom.  But definitely it was real!  I should mention that I liked the irony of this book--who you were expecting to die--Hazel Grace--and you still know she will, didn't!  The healthy one of the group, well, that was Gus.  I also like to think that Gus and Hazel Grace will be together in Heaven!I think we'll have a great book-club discussion about this book!"
2," am a 17-year-old girl that reads a lot of books, and I read very quickly.  I read this one in two sittings.  I read a little over half of it the night before, then finished it when I woke up the next morning.  I kind of regret it in that I rushed through such a powerful book in so little time, but it was hard to stop reading.The Fault in Our Stars hit a little closer to home for me than most people.  My sister passed away from a congenital disease when she was just a couple years younger than Hazel and Augustus Waters (I feel the need to use his whole name, as you will see when you read the book), so this novel echoed many feelings and experiences in my life.  I found myself relating to Hazel in a very natural way, mostly due to the incredible skill with which John Green creates his characters.However, The Fault in Our Stars isn't just a book about young people with cancer, and you don't need to have a relationship with terminal illness to be utterly changed by this book.  It made me laugh, cry, and ultimately reconsider my perspective on life and death.  The main characters handle life, dying, and love with incredible maturity that makes you fall in love with them as they do with each other.  If there is one book you plan to read this year or if, like me, you read so many that you lose track, this book should be it.  You will not regret it."
4," As a Hospice volunteer I got a lot out of the book.  As a Cancer survivor (for now) I enjoyed Hazel's and Gus's individual journeys to acceptance of our Universe and the seemingly randomness of God's plans for us as individuals, lovers, families and friends.  Leaving traces of kindness is greater than piles of money or a littered landscape of greed and uncaring.  Like Romeo and Juliet or the young couple in the gift of the Magi, Hazel and Gus cared about each other more than themselves. That is love. We can experience and see love and a beautiful Universe all the time if we look for it.  Love is something to be given and then you receive as both Hazel and Gus found out.  Love can be shared with parents, siblings, friends and even strangers who may make your wishes come true or your day just a little better.  We all need to be content just enjoying the presence of others and the small amout of time we have on this earth that God has given us.  The Fault in Our Stars is a modern day A Separate Peace.  It is thought provoking and demands teenagers and adults alike to question the meaning of life and how we choose live it. It can generate deep discussions with family, friends, book clubs and students. This book bridges some of the gaps between men and women, parents and children, physically perfect and physically challenged as well as the living and the dying."
5," The book was good but for some reason it just wasn't for me. Some sections seemed to drag longer than they needed to. At some points it seemed a little too obvious that the words were being written by a middle aged man with a rather vast vocabulary which didn't exactly fit with the fact that it is supposed to be written from the point of view of a sixteen year old girl. But hey, when a sixteen year old girl has cancer and graduates early and is a homebody perhaps she uses the spare time to expand her vocabulary. who knows? Overall, kudos to the author. So many people that I know really liked this book and this movie. Though it wasn't for me, I'd encourage others to give it a shot. Word of warning tho, it seems books about people with illness have gone from one extreme (of super encouraging/ inspirational) to the next (borderline defeatist, or pessimistic ) in an attempt to capture what people with terminal illness actually think and feel. This book is the latter. Perhaps it is more honest, I don't have a terminal illness so I don't know. Someone I was very close to, however, did have a terminal illness and he died way way WAY before I thought he would. A week or two before they were going to release him to go home actually. And he did not adopt the , woah-is-me-nobody-understands-what-im-going-through-and-all-your-attempts-to-make-me-feel-loved-are-futile attitude."
5," TFiOS is an attractive book; it's sleek and sexy, with characters who speak with both humor and sadness.My critique would be that the author uncovers many threads but doesn't seem to be interested in following through. There are so many side stories going on that we as the readers are never fully invested in.Also, I thought Kaitlyn was a really irritating character. What was she implying at the end, that maybe Gus didn't love Hazel enough to leave something behind for her, or that he was secretly having an affair? I didn't get it.Many times characters seemed like caricatures, not real people. But considering the whole premise of the novel, I suppose it works.Also, I think Green doesn't understand girls. Hazel gives these nihilistic, existentialist, logical philosophies but then goes, he is so hot. Mr. Green, I don't think girls work that way. While we're at it, why did Hazel think V for Vendetta was a boys movie? That movie is amazing no matter what sex you are. It's political and deals with oppression and authority, NOT a boys movie at all. I thought Hazel would have appreciated it.I did love the book, but in retrospect there is a lot to be said for some of the character development and plot. Interesting, but anyone who thinks it's the Bible needs to re-prioritize their bookshelves. Not the best thing since sliced bread, but okay."
3," Surprisingly moving, even for this 63 year old cancer survivor.  Well written, edited and proofed; rather a rarity lately.  I'll go on to read John Green's other works in all the media available."
4," cannot summarize, but I'll tell you what I felt reading this beautiful story, pain, love, sadness fear, hope and raw beauty. We are all dying, and as cliche as this is, Hazel was really living."
5, This is an amazing book you should write more books little this!! OMG can't wait to to the end!! EXCITTTTEEEDDDD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5, This book was one of the most beautifully written books I have ever read. I'm am very sure that I will be reading this book again. it took me on a rollercoaster with my emotions. I loved it!!!!!!
5," John Green writes with such raw honesty, you would swear this this had been written by a young cancer patient.  You will come to love Hazel and Agustus and wish you had an ounce of their courage."
5," From other reviews of this book, I was expecting something amazing, but I found it to be a bit prosaic, predictable and contrived. But it gets three stars for characterisation and turn of phrase."
2, don't quite know what to say about this book. I feel the lump in my throat and the tears in my eyes tell the story and it's emotional impact better than my words can. It's stunningly beautiful.
3," What an amazing story, relatable characters, great writing! I felt so many emotions while reading this book, but mostly I cried. Will definitely be recommending this book with family and friends."
5, This book is a true gem that went unnoticed by me for far too long.The plain story is stunning and the deeper meaning is eye opening.I read the entire book in one sitting.
5," At times funny, always deeply moving, this book is a tour de force. perhaps not quite as original and different as Looking for Alaska but still deserving of all the accolades."
5," thought this book was both tragic and hilarious, John green has made a beautiful, hilarious,and  entertaining book out of such a sad, serious subject. God bless John green for making this book."
5, This book was beyond the most influential and inspiring book I've read in my life. Ever. I hope to someday find a guy like Augustus. Love this book. So incredible. Words just can't do it justice.
5, this book was addicting for me. even though it featured so many saddeningmoments the romantic vibe made it more than a sad story of peoples struggles. amazing book and i recommend it to everyone!
5, was instantaneously captivated by this book. Hazel and Augustus are characters that you care about and I found myself laughing and tearing up all at the same time. I highly recommend this book!
5," was completely ready to poo-poo this as more teen novel junk food, until I put the author together with the clever, geeky,funny-as-hell middle-aged man who most computer people know as 'half the blog brothers.' If you are worried about this being just a cheap sell-out or a Nicholas sparks wannabe, I have great news: the fault in our stars is anything but that.The narrator has all the smarminess and observant qualities as a chuck palahniuk character, but with a much more real-life feel. I was reminded over and over again of what it was like to have that unique teenager wisdom of half-childness with adult capacity for understanding. Even without the fatal illness, the characters would have felt full on their own.But the real gem for me was the philosophical thoughts on life, love and death that saturate this read. Sure, green's not coming up with anything new here; but he brings so much of himself and his life into the pages that the frequent revelations aren't canned to be 'stitched into a pillow', as his protagonists would say. Instead, they have a warm, open-ended feel, like an intimate conversation between long-time friends.If the fault in our stars doesn't sound like a book you would typically read, read it anyway. If it is your usual cup of tea, read it too: this is one case where both camps will come away very happy."
5," Warning a few SPOILERS AHEAD:First there were a few things I disliked only a little.  Gus died, although this made me cry my eyes out, I see why it was necessary, In a way I can't really explain.  Second, I felt it was too short, maybe I've been reading trilogies too much, but I felt there should have been more pages for extension of relationships.  Now for the many things I did like.  This was a real book.  I complained about the death of Tris in Divergent , because no one wants a character to die. That death was meaningless, this one meant something. There was no fake junk in this book, this was completely authentic and I loved it for once.  This was told straight up by Hazel, she said the stuff I would find myself thing;crying in the moments I would cry.  She was a real person, she didn't suck it up all the time and had weak moments like real people.  This book puts a whole new perspective on life for people and as I write this I'm starting to cry again.  As shailene Woodley said It's a book about cancer but it's not about cancer. It's about living your life and how life works. It's not gonna be all sunshine and rainbows and John Green puts this into perfect perspective.  I would recommend this book to everyone and I think Hazel and Gus would agree.  This is a mind changer.  It's mostly not a sappy death story, but a real book.  A real real book."
2," My granddaughter said this was her new favorite book, and she reads a LOT of books so I figured I'd better read it too, in spite of the somewhat off-putting hype surrounding it. I really liked it, and really liked the author, whom I knew nothing about until after I'd finished the book.The characters are both precious and precocious, but pretty much in the same way that many young people naturally are, and I think that's why they appealed to me so much. They felt interesting and believable and lived normal lives in the midst of the chaos that cancer wracked them with. I know that to be an authentic part of living with catastrophic circumstances: you do have a lot of really serious and dramatic things to deal with, but you also have to do something about living your life. You still get holes in your jeans, still need the occasional haircut, and maybe even, unexpectedly, meet someone you want to fall in love with.The book unfolded that way; with both cataclysm and the mundane, marking some remarkable young lives that were full and purposeful, even if they were destined for brevity. Later I learned that John Green based Hazel's character on a real person he knew, and saw some of the videos she made before her death a few years ago. Even better. Hazel was awesome. Her life was full. It felt really good to know that."
4, A beautiful book that warms your heart and makes you cry all at the same time. It's one of the best books I have ever encountered and I am looking forward to reading more of John Green 's books.
5," This book is amazing it made me feel important in the world even if I don't think I am, that someone loves me even if I don't love me and  I think I am useless. I recommend this book to anyone!!"
5," Green is an AMAZING  author. The Fault in Our Stars ( and although I have never had cancer,) is MY ALA. TOTALLY worth the money. BUY IT!!!!!! &lt;3Read the book to find out what ALA is."
5," am speechless after reading this book. It pulls at all your emotions, but that's it isn't it, pain demands to be felt. Love this book in ways I can't describe. Fall in love with this as I did!"
5, appreciated that this book made me laugh and cry. I connected with the characters easily and hoped the best for them. The emotions from the page come to life as you read and want to read more.
5," loved this book! It was just the right amount of humility and seriousness mixed together..... I would recommend this book to every single on of my friends :) it was quite a tear jerker btw :,)"
5," This book is absolutely amazing. The story is so deeply effective to the reader, yet it still plays in humor at just the right times in an otherwise serious topic of cancer. This is a must-read."
5," A heartbreaking and perfect exploration of love at its best, expressed through people living with one of the worst challenges life can offer.  So beautifully written I read it twice in two days!"
5," was based when I first opened this book. Cancer books...ugh. but seriously, this is not a Nicholas sparks novel. It's raw and real and beautiful. And you will cry. For the living and the dead."
2, This is by far one of the best books that I have read in a long time. Very deep. Made waterfalls pour from my eyes. It definitely one of my favorites. I will have no problem rereading this book.
5," Yeah, its that good.The characters are amazingly real and you REALLY feel for them.I cried at about the 2/3 mark and I'm thankful for it.Just buy the damn book already, you won't be sorry."
5," The Fault in Our Stars by John Green is about a teenage girl, Hazel, who has cancer and attends support meetings with other teenagers who share similar stories. One day she meets Augustus, who is in remission. They share a connection that links their lives together.I was curious to read this novel because on one hand it was being praised so highly, and on the other hand, the realism of the characters was being judged. To top it off, a movie was being released. I’m always a sucker for books that are adapted as movies. As soon as I saw a trailer, I ran to get my hands on the book. Right before the movie came out I finished reading The Fault in Our Stars.The characters were witty and their humor was dark, but I found it hilarious. Of course their teenagers, and teenagers don’t normally act or discuss things like these two characters, but they are fictitious. Their lives call for them to have matured sooner than your average teen. I loved the novel and had high hopes for the film.It’s been almost two weeks ago since I’ve seen it, which gave me enough time to get my emotions in check. I came out of that theater with my eyes red and swollen. Even though the movie adaptation was not completely like the novel I was extremely happy with it.I give The Fault in Our Stars novel and movie 5 out of 5 stars.Check out my other reviews at avidreads.weebly.com"
5," This seems to be the new hit of the season. A modern version of a teen love story between two teens that are experiencing the devastation of a cancer diagnosis. Something that far too many young persons are having their innocents robbed by this all thought consuming disease. Girl and boy meet in a group therapy class. The story developes as their relationship grows. A story that all who appreciate a first love story will appreciate. Tender, funny and thought provoking page after page. As a 65+ person, I put my mindset as I read this into the shoes of my 13 and 16 year old granddaughters and felt the true bond and emotions of the two main characters.It was not a morbid read, as one might think, but I found it inspiring and thoughtfully written. An easy read and one to surely make an impact on the young reader. In fact any grandparent  parent should read it along with their teens and then have a book review and share their feelings and open a dialog into a teen illness that is sure to touch someone in their circle of family and friend or neighbors and school. Embrace the story and share the positive vibes that this young couple share with the reader. I have not seen the movie but I plan to. My advise is to always read the book before seeing the movie, to make sure you can fill in all the missing parts that sometimes movies skip."
5, Loved this book.  I was disappointed when I looked down and saw how far into the book I was that I knew it wasn't very long.  I loved the humor these teenagers have in regards to their illness.
5, This is probably the best book ive ever read. I read more than the normal human being i ive read my fair share of good books and i have to say that i will read this book for the rest of my life
5,"t was a great book, I enjoyed reading it, but it was really predictable. The best part of a great book is when the ending surprises you, and I called the ending. I would read it again though.."
5, Emotional &amp; powerful journey of two teenagers.  Warning: this book is a tear jerker.  Goes to show that we should cherish all moments in life - no matter how short.  I'd recommend it as a read.
3, read this book straight through without putting it down - I may have to sleep for 2 days straight now.  I laughed out loud and a cried so hard I couldn't see the words on the pages.  Read it.
5, thought the book was well written and pretty spectacular. I also think it was a touching story and I wish there was more for me to read. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it the book to anyone older than 12
2," just finished the book and I'm crying. Never thought that would happen while reading a book. I am in love with this and will never look at the world the same. Thank you John Green, thank you."
4," Appreciated the honesty and real way that Green handled the topic of cancer.  Cancer + being a teenager?  Double yikes.  Definitely shed some tears, but also laughed out loud.  Loved this book."
5," thought this book was very good, characters were amazing. Read the book in about 2 days and when I put it down all I could do was look forward to reading it again. Read with a box of tissues."
5," Few words can describe how incredible this book is. I felt like I was there, seeing Gus's blue eyes and breathing through the cannula. The best way I can describe it is this: Okay? .... Okay."
5," The book was great,  I expected the book to be sad considering the subject, but I laughed as much, if not more than I cried.  I' m looking for a book for my book club pick, this may be the one."
5," Picked this book on a whim and was completely engrossed from the first page. Funny, heartbreaking, poignant, wise. These are just a few of the words I would use to describe this EXCELLENT book."
5,n my opinion John Gren has completely outdone himself with this new book. He sets you up and then slowly breaks your heart in the most painful way possible. And you'll love every minute of it.
5," The average Amazon rating from over 10000 readers of The Fault in Our Stars is near 5.  I wanted to see if there was a common thread running through the critiques of those who had rated it a 1.  I saw pretentious in a number of reviews but it was applied to a number of different facets of the book - in my quick scanning I didn't note a predominant complaint. I thought it was well done.  I liked Hazel and Augustus very much, though I did find Hazel a bit wearing sometimes.  Do 16 1/2 year olds really speak and think like that? As I approached the end I wondeed what the final paragraphs would be like, and once again my mental drafts were way of.  This is a very emotional ride, certainly not a feel good book, but given the audience and reputation that it has established there were no major surprises, and so the book feels true all the way through.  It does not pull punches, it focuses not only on the two but on their parents and their emotions and pain as well.  I am sure that very few readers got through the book without shedding a tear or two.  Throughout the many down moments, characters and readers mourn for what could have been but, wise beyond their years, Hazel and Augustus appreciate what they did have too, and that knowlege, that 'they'll always have Amsterdam' provides some nice balance for readers as well."
5," There was so much hype going into this book, I knew I had to read it. I had heard John Green on YouTube with his history videos that had Harry Potter and Star Wars references. Some of my favorite things.I love Hazel and Augustus. They are rare species that, once read, will never be forgotten. I like that. I enjoy books like that.The books is really well written. Really, really well written. Almost so that it seems like John just wanted to show off. Maybe he did, maybe he didn't. But some of the vocabulary was unnecessary. And he ranted quite a bit about theories and physiological things. Nonetheless, very well written. I think the only explanation is that John Green is an alien.It's hard to find a good book with many pages and fascinating characters. Though I didn't cry, I wanted to, but I was too preoccupied with finding out what was going to happen next, I just simply let my heart break and smile when necessary.There were a few times I (gently) slammed my Kindle cover shut and announced to my husband, I hate John Green. Why would he make me love Hazel Grace and Gus and Isaac and then it just... sigh. I don't hate John Green. I love him. I love this book. Four stars only because a third of the time I didn't quite understand the necessity of some of the diction.GREAT book. Read it."
5, This is one of the best books! I have never really liked romance type books but this one... it was so good I couldn't even tell! :)  I read this book in one sitting. I couldn't help my self :)
2," Story itself was good, but characters didn't seem well developed, and I had a hard time believing that their behaviors and feelings were genuine... Not enough depth in the characters, I guess."
5, would recommend this book to everyone. Possibly one of the best books I've ever read. So touching and heart warming and filled with love and emotion. Phenomenal book. Absolutely outstanding.
3," Even in my 20s I still enjoy reading YA books. This one was no exception. I laughed, cried and felt a connection to the characters. The book is sad but uplifting at the same time. A must read!"
5, My 13 year old daughter is not an avid reader.  I was thrilled when she could not put this book down.  We were driving from NJ to North Carolina and she finished the book in the 11 hour drive.
5," Yes, a book for all ages, and everyone should read it! I found myself laughing and crying while finishing it in a day and a half. Could not put it down. The writing style is quirky and mature!"
5, What a major tearjerker at some parts . Also made you think about what could happen to anyone. This book holds so much truth in it that it gets really hard to put down. Definitely recommend it
5," There really isn’t anything original I can say about this book and while I didn’t have the life-changing experience like so many others I cannot deny this is a special and important read.While I loved Hazel and Gus and can recognise how special their relationship was – for me the true love story of this book was Hazel and her mom. The love the two shared for each other was nothing short of stunning and the moments depicted between them were gut-wrenchingly beautiful.Perhaps because I was prepared for what would happen (thanks to idiotic fangirls on twitter tweeting memes) I didn’t truly feel invested in the story but did experience little bursts of emotion as John Green’s wonderful prose couldn’t help but stir feelings within.My favourite part of this book has to be its honest and blunt look at living with illness. As someone who has a chronic illness and deals with pain on a daily basis, I recognise that dark humour that is sometimes shocking to those who can’t understand what you're going through but is necessary for your own emotional and psychological survival. I’m so glad John Green didn’t sugarcoat the experience.Beautifully written with wonderful characters, The Fault in Our Stars is an achingly real and heartbreaking look at the brave struggle for life that so many face every day."
5, Well written and thoughtful romance as well as funny. I definitely recommend this book! I think it's perfect for a wide range of age groups from teens to retired. Can't wait to see the movie.
3,t was amazing quick emotional and intellectual. you don't get this combination often but you will find complete satisfaction with this book John green did an amazing job on writing this book
5, A very good book. I loved it from the beginning to the end. A funny and sad heartwarming book that is true in so many ways. A Great book that I am so glad I read. Now I have to see the movie.
2," What can I say other than this book is AMAZING! Once I began reading, I couldn't stop. This book definitely touched my heart, and I couldn't help crying my eyes out! This book is a must-read!"
5, have a new perspective on life after this book. I will remember a fake couple longer than people I know who have gone already or will. Which is sad but read this book and you'll understand.
5," Just finished, and I wish I had the will power to have read it slower. Once you think it can't get anymore beautiful, it does. I wish all people were a  honest as the characters in this book."
5, This book has been the only book to bring me to tears and have me smiling in a matter of seconds. John green is an amazing writer and has a great sight into the mind of people with illnesses.
5," Smart. Poignant. Humorous and tragic at the same time. I felt whispers of Romeo &amp; Juliet woven throughout. You knew, inevitably how it would end, but would be left speechless upon completion."
5," A riveting book from start to finish. I can see the star of Juno playing Hazel Grace. Be prepared for tears, which does not require a spoiler alert, as the book's description gives it away."
5, truly loved this heartfelt book about teens battling cancer.  Subject matter was deep but the author made it a most intriguing journey with the characters.  I recommend this as a must read.
5, laughed and cried during  this book. John Green did a wonderful job portraying Augustus and Hazel. The way his visions of the world is beautifully written and was and still is a great read.
5," This book will broaden the smallest minds and light the darkest hearts. No matter where you are in your life, this is a place and feeling and emotion and moment we have all found ourselves in"
5," This is a book that needs to be read.  It is painful and mesmerizing. It taught me a lot about love, pain, wanting and needing. You will be happy to get through this book, but sad it is over."
2," laughed and cried all the way through, the way John is able to quickly pull the reader in and have us quickly become emotionally invested in all of the characters is beyond amazing!DFTBA!"
5," What a brilliant book. It was funny, depressing, hopeful, wonderful, and just downright impressive. Kudos, John Green. You have a talent unlike any other. Thank you for this book. Thank you."
5," nearly wasn't going to read it due to the fact I'm easily reduced to a blubbering mess for days in stories like this. Plus the sense-memory of my own battle with the big ‘C’ just adds to the feels. But as evident of this review I finally caved – and true to form, was not fit for public appearances for at least two days.I loved how the book gives the reader a glimpse into how undiscriminating cancer is, how it steals your dignity, and how moments of despair and resolve wash over you. It is a heart-warming love story though.Going into the novel without expectations, and not trying to anticipate the plot let me revel in the beauty of Hazel and Gus, to see the determination and will to experience life through their eyes. There are layers about love, life, survival, death, significance/insignificance (and I could list ten more) in John Greens’ writing that make this an incredible read.Hazel was quiet and strong, and Gus was devilishly cheeky and debonair. The dialogue is comically dark, which is something I experienced first hand in my personal battle. Humour really does smooth over the inevitability of it all‘The Fault in our Stars’ has a place in my top ten favourites and I highly recommend it. But be warned: the story may destroy relationships for you forever. Gus is a hard guy to live up to."
5," John Green has managed to create a young almost a woman who reacts and responds to the blessings and woes life offers in a genuinely fresh fashion.  We know why Augustus couldn't keep his eyes off of her.  Hazel Grace thought really honest, often pragmatic thoughts about the life that was hers, and the lives around her.  She shared some of these bold, honest thoughts out loud, and was a kind enough human to keep others to herself.How we rejoiced when Augustus Waters entered her life, with his unique life energy.  For all young and older health challenged folk anchored in the literal heart of Jesus, living these incredible lives we have been granted one day at a time, with deep pain and tears and sorrows I never want to truly fully know about . . . Well, God bless and keep you until you are gathered completely into the forever heart of Christ, with His unending love and perpetual Light, and may God sustain all who love you and keep you in their hearts and memories.  And may God bless John Green for responding to the sacred nudges of the Holy Spirit, in writing a book full of youthful insights and humor.  Your faithfulness to this divinely inspired task will do its singular work in the infinitely different souls that read your tale, and continue to pause for rest and reflection in the heart of Jesus.  Just lovely."
5," Firstly, I'd like to say that I both HATE and LOVE everyone who ever dared to even mention this book to me. The truth, the finality, the emotion, and the power of words that are as real as the day is long. Just under four hours were spent on this piece of literature - little more than a dollar for each... a small price to pay for a small sliver of eternity of which I had the opportunity to briefly glimpse into and feel that it was mine. In a fraction of a day, I have became more attached to a handful of fictional characters than I have probably ever been attached to anyone else in my whole life. And, the closing of this book, feels like the closing of my own heart...Thanks to this book, I am now increasingly more in touch with my emotional side as well as closer to dehydration from the hour I spent crying late into the night - unable to will myself to stop reading except for a few moments in which tears blurred my vision too much to continue. If you think for a moment that you would like to even touch a copy of this book, I strongly encourage you to purchase a new box of tissues first.I doubt I will ever read another book like this one, not because I cannot bring myself to do it, but because there will never be another in the history of mankind. Thank you, John Green, for these precious few hours... Thank you"
5," finished reading The Fault In Our Stars. Literally I just got done. As a dry my tears and gather my breathe , I give this book 5 stars. I would give it 10 stars if I could. John Green you moved me with Hazel and Augustus . Every girl wants to have a Augustus Waters in their life if only for five minutes. You open the eyes of many about cancer. You did not sugarcoat it but you also were not to serious about the diease that takes so many good people away from those who loved them so much.  I want to be Hazel so I can experience what true love is if only for a brief moment in time. Oh how you made this book seem so real and in your face. The trip to Amsterdam brought back memories to me as I have been there and you had the Anne Frank house described to a tee and right on point.  I cried heavy tears when you had to take our Augustus away from us in the book. I was so mad at you, for about five minutes. I knew I had to continue to keep reading. The letters Augustus wrote in his final days made my heart swell. What a good guy, even in death. Your supporting characters, Isaac was a great distraction to the broken heart. Hazel parents showed that it was okay to cry in front of your children and to be weak as the parent. What more can I say except THANK YOU. I have become a instant fan of a one JOHN GREEN . Look forward to your next book."
5," This book can only be described as beautiful. I mean it. I have read some seriously good books in my time, and this easily makes my top 8 (Hey, 1-7 are the Harry Potters) as one of my all time favorites.There are several things that I want to talk about in this review, starting with the story.The story was fantastic. It was about a girl with thyroid cancer (I think. Lost my copy before writing this review. Typical.) Who meets this drop dead GORGEOUS guy at her cancer support group. It's love at first sight for him (as is revealed at the end of the book), but it really takes her months to feel that way about him. When she does start feeling that way for him, they're in Amsterdam, there to meet their favorite author. A few weeks later, something inevitable for many cancer patients occurs.The writing was even beter than the writing on Before I Fall. My only complaint is how much cursing there was. Even though I'm 14, I HATE cursing. But, I guess that I can overlook it.The love story was very well written, though it does get a tiny bit mature at one point. Younger readers should skip that scene.The ending. God. When it was coming, I saw it, but it was still heartbreaking. It made me cry for days after.If I could give this 100 stars, I certainly would."
5, Spare me from teenage dialogue that is excruciatingly witty enough to sound contrived. For a book that has generated so much buzz about being a tearjerker it felt surprisingly sterile to me.
5," generally don't read books like this one, but after a friend recommended this, I fell in love!  The characters are great, and there is a wonderful story here as well.  What a great writer!"
5," Being a teen who loves to read, I am very glad I picked this book. The Fault in Our Stars has possibly become one of my all-time favorite books. 5 Stars to John Green for this amazing piece."
2," Having seen the movie previews, I knew the book would be heartbreaking. I could never have imagined it would end the way that it did. This was one of the most amazing books I have ever read!"
5," This was definitely a moving story with laughs and tears. It was relatable to me in many ways which may be why I enjoyed it so much. Either way, it's a great tale about love, life, and loss."
5," This book is a game changer. I haven't been captivated by a book like this for quite awhile. An eye opener to the world around us, this book really makes you think. A must read for all ages."
5, This book really makes you appreciate life and friendship/family. I cried a lot; I laughed a lot.  A truly great book from John Green. You will enjoy this regardless of your literary tastes.
5, Wonderfully written and eloquently expressed.  The style was... humorous and yet morose and almost cynical at times.  I enjoyed it immensely and look forward to Mr. Green's next publication.
5," A beautiful, heartwarming story of two young adults braving cancer and its effects.  Just because something is not meant to last forever, isn't it still worth having for as long as possible?"
5," don't even have words for how deeply thoughtful and amazing this novel is. It touched me on many levels and reminded me of the things that matter most. Please read it, you won't regret it."
5, This book definitely made me think. I felt it too. I cried at the sad parts and laughed at the funny parts. Thank God I read this or I wouldn't have read one of the best books in my opinion.
5," Everybody IS a person. It's true! Even if you're a kid, even if you have cancer, and even if you're a dolphin (that has nothing to do with the book... but its true! Dolphins are people too)."
5," was blown away by this book  -funny, touching, full of symbolism.....highly recommended...Don't be put off thinking this is either a YA book or a morbid topic...just read it and love it!"
2," Okay, I think you got to put aside all your judgments on Dawson's Creek with their 500 SAT word vocabulary.  That was my first complaint after reading the 1st chapter.  Do teenagers really talk like this?  Well, you got to suspend disbelief for a while and just go with it.  After all, these teenagers have to appear more adult like going through terminal illness.  After a few chapters, you pretty much can figure out that someone is going to fall in love with someone and then something will happen.  I hate to give away anything but you will have to read this book to find out.  Well, I really loved the side characters like Isaac who lost his sight.  The main characters are amazing in the fact they may try hard but really they are human.  I think watching it afterwards on film was a big benefit.  It really proved me wrong that a good book cannot be transferred to film.  The actors in the film are amazing and everything is spot on accurate.  For the ending, it pretty much gives you what you want in terms of happy/sad ending so don't want to ruin it.  I even liked how Isaac took his new view point on things after his procedure and losing his girlfriend.  It isn't easy and much harder once you feel like you lost everything.  So, I put this book up there for mostly young at heart folks who still believe in love during hard times."
5," Words are useless when speaking about words.When many of my friends told me about this book they said the cried. They told me how sad or was to read about people falling in love but then potentially losing everything. However, when I read the book I did not see what made it so sad that it brought tears their eyes. When reading this book I laughed. Not at the saddening parts, but at those small parts in between those sad parts.Every good book has that one part that makes you want to cry and that one part that makes you want to laugh. This book, this beautiful book, was one big part that made you want to laugh AND cry.What made this book so beautiful was not the laughter nor the tears nor the sacrifices the characters made, but the actions and emotions the characters showed throughout the novel. How when something bad happens each character has an optimistic view and way of dealing with it.This book should show all young readers the joys in life come only from sacrifice and sadness. How in life there will be times where you want to give up, where you want to just lie on you're bed and listen to music, hoping it will go away. But the key to this, and what this book shows, is that it's not what happens that makes you sad. It's how you look at it.--14 year old girl--"
5, can see why it was made into a movie. It was a beautiful written story and I will definitely get to the movie and hope they do not alter it too much.  I have recommended It to my friends.
5," The Fault is in Our Stars.  So many beautiful thoughts.  Well worth the 324 pages.  I like how the author makes you feel a part of Hazel's world, not just an onlooker.  How does he do that?"
4, loved this book. Couldn't wait to get home and read it. I never understood how people would cry when they read a book  but this one made me cry. I'll definitely be reading this one again.
5," This was a great read. I can't wait for the movie to come out. I know it will make made cry, right up there with The Notebook, which I cannot watch again it was so sad, and Steel Magnolias."
5," this book is like heaven with angles on top. like oh my Lord, this book is to die for. I totally recommend this book for teenagers that have high vocabulary. but like dude read this book!!!"
5," There are no words that do this book justice. John Green has done the impossible, make me fall in love with two fictional characters at the same time. Isaac and Augustus are something else."
5, couldn't put it down. Endearing characters I fell in love with and rallied for their win. Makes you think differently about people with a terminal illness ;no matter their age. Brilliant.
5,t's hard to say in words what it is about this book it that makes you feel so many things in a shot can't-put-this-book-down span of time. Hard for me to say in words. Easy for John Green.
2," Even though this book is about teens I still at age 63 really enjoyed it. A good read, somewhat sad, but sometimes that is just the way life can be. So important to enjoy each moment of it."
5, loved everything about it -- especially the way it is so relatable. It is a great book for teens and really anyone. I am on my third time reading it. This is SUCH a great book; I love it!
5," A beautiful book that I couldn't put down. Very well written. Humorous, witty, emotional. John Green is able to describe character's experience so that you fall in love with the characters."
5," By far the greatest book I've ever read. I borrowed it once from the library and decided that I needed to OWN it. I bought it, such a beautiful book - physically and in content. Perfection."
5," Although this book had big words, it was a fantastic read. I didn't particularly like how it ended because  I wanted to read how Gus made the book end. But this book was amazing in my eyes."
5," Amazing- this book was one that I absolutely could not put down, and didn't, reading beginning to end in one evening. Not only is it a love story, but such a beautifully written life story."
5, This book is too real. The emotions and the opinions are so raw. It's refreshing and a heart-gut beauty. This is not the first and certainly won't be the last time I read this amazing book.
5," suppose I'm going to be called a heretic for not liking The Fault in Our Stars more than I did. Honestly, I found the book a bit predictable and emotionally manipulative.When I was a teenager, I read Erich Segal's novel, Love Story. Like The Fault in Our Stars, it was about two young people (in this case, college students) who met, formed an unlikely bond, and fell in love. It was by turns funny and tragic. The characters were witty, and their circumstances engaging. It contained the classic line, Love means never having to say you're sorry. I was completely enamored with the book and movie back in the early 80s. Checking in on Love Story now, though, it seems entirely too precocious for its own good. For me, The Fault in Our Stars reads much the same as Love Story--it's funny and tragic, its characters are witty, its circumstances are engaging, but it's just a little too precocious.I adore John Green's activism and use of media like YouTube. As a person, he seems like a great guy, with some great ideologies. But I was left feeling as though I'd been force fed The Fault in Our Stars, and that's too bad. I fear that it's going to be one of those books that might not stand the test of time, like Love Story. Give it a decade or two, and we'll realize it was trying just a little too hard."
5," You don’t get to choose if you get hurt in this world, old man, but you do have some say in who hurts you. I like my choices. I hope she likes hers.Ay caramba! I've had this book since before it officially debuted. I friggin' preordered, and I didn't have the guts to read it for a long time. I worried that it was overhyped garbage and that I'd be disappointed. With the movie coming out, I decided that should be enough incentive to read it. Will I see the movie now that I've finished reading it? Probably not, and I am totally fine with that.What to write about a book that everyone's already read, raved, and reviewed?! Simply that although it was enjoyable, I'm not sure that it blew me away. I think everyone's experiences with love, disease, and death are unique, and for me this one didn't particularly ring true, so it was hard for me to get emotionally involved. I feel like that makes me a monster. Muhahaha! But there it is.Alright, I'm not a complete monster. I will say that when I was about 77% close to finishing, a small pebble formed in the back of my throat, but I didn't choke up. Also, I'm not sure I completely understood or agreed with Green's philosophizing. I like to think that maybe I'm not worthy of being proselytized; I'm a heathen. Sorry to all the nerdfighters."
5," My son introduced me to John Green (&amp; his brother, Hank) about a year ago when he was studying for a middle school chemistry exam. He had somehow found the Green Brothers' video series, Crash Course, in which John and Hank take all that boring stuff that teachers teach and make it interesting and memorable. If you have never watched a Crash Course video, go watch one now! So, even though I have been a fan of John Green's for a year, The Fault in Our Stars is the first of his novels that I have read.I've known about this novel since soon after it was published but have avoided it because a friend had told me she cried through the entire books. I don't like sad books so avoided this book like the plague. Yet, as a John Green fan, I felt like I had to read this book and finally gave in and purchased The Fault in Our Stars when it was on sale for the Kindle.A day and a half into this novel, I was feeling pretty cocky about the fact that I had yet to cry and then it happened...the tears came and came and came. Yes, this is a tearjerker but it is a beautiful tearjerker and it is worth the read. The Fault in Our Stars reminds us how fragile life is and how short it can be.Now, I know why so many people have deep feelings about this story...I guess I do, too, now. Go read it, now.."
2," loved this book. It was like putting myself into perspective and see that we are so lucky to get up everyday and have the opportunity to breath, to live, and to make the best of that day"
4, There are few books I read again and again like Hazel as I am a voracious reader. However there are some cherished books that I will never forget and this is indeed one of those treasures.
5, could not put it down. I'm not a huge reader and was just looking at the sample to pass time but I finished the sample and HAD to buy the full version on my kindle. Definitely recommend.
5, The book was in perfect condition and this is such a great book! I've been around to store and a hardcover it about &amp;20.00. And the book is so so well written and worth buying and reading.
5," As a cancer survivor, patient, and reader this book sums up some of the many emotions felt during the process.  Fabulous love story, very real and very touching.  Best read in 2014 so far!"
5, loved this book. It took a very real &amp; dispassionate look at disability &amp; death from the point of view of the people experiencing it. easy to read &amp; well-written. I couldn't put it down.
5," loved te reality in this book! John green never disappoints, but I think this one is his best so far.  Great deep read...I am going to get this into my 9th grade English curriculum ASAP!"
5," Really well written, beautifully constructed storyline. The strong visual language &amp; well selected wording make it a pleasure &amp; desire to read. I'm sad it's over. I'll miss Hazel Augustus."
5, enjoyed this book even though i found myself gasping for air in-between sobs! Immense honesty and unfathomable circumstances break your heart in this book! Prepare yourself with tissues!
5, Curious and introspective story of adolescents dealing with adult issues. The reader has the opportunity to delve into the minds of the characters who face terminal illnesses. A good read.
2," couldn't stop reading. Some of the best writing I've ever had the pleasure of reading. I can hardly put into words the power of this book. I laughed, I cried, and I enjoyed every second."
5, Good read. large print. The story is excellent should be read regardless of age. Hard cover great for sharing with others as I have handed it off. Shipped fast and orderly with out damage.
5, would treat this book as my very own version of An Imperial Affliction. Something so special and so moving that there are not enough words to describe the way that I truly feel about it.
5," This book brings me to tears over and over again. The though that their love will last for an infinity (a large one at that) even if the world ends and becomes oblivion, is beautiful. The metaphors are all amazing, Augustus.I am not a parent myself, hell I'm fourteen years old, but I could feel myself connecting to both Hazel and Gus' parents. The thought of losing someone in that painfully slow way that Augustus died is more horrible than anything. Not necessarily that his death was slow and painful, but that he was essentially dying for years.I do still wonder when Hazel dies and how her mother and father handle it, quite like Hazel and An Imperial Affliction. Does her mother become a better Patrick than Patrick? Do her parents stay married for their own infinity?The questions are endless, but the book sadly has an ending. I wish it could go on forever, but I'm sure I wouldn't have enough tears in my body. John Green is a profound author, and I will definitely be reading all of his books that I can find.And to John, thank you for opening my heart to these characters and making me understand the thoughts of cancer patients a little better than I do now. I will hopefully never know exactly how Hazel or Augustus felt, but I sympathize even though I know they would both hate it."
5," This book was the best book I have ever read. I was glued to the book and read it in two days. Parts of the book made me cry because I have never felt the way hazel felt but I can imagine what she felt. This book was very good for me to read because I have never experienced cancer or knowing anyone I loved have cancer. It is very hard to empathize knowing that you are going to die. I understand the world isn't fair and I hate it for being that way.  In the book I thought Hazel was the one that was going to die because, I read the beginning and remember some one saying that the book had a very sad ending. It surprised me that A.Waters died. My fingernails are bit down to the bed because I was crying and nervous and a mess during the book. Gus had a very bright mind and very intelligent one. His sentences are like quotes put together to form a poem.  The reason I read this book was because it was a) recommended to me b) my cousins' friend was a fault in our stars fan and I am going to go meet her and we might go see the movie. I wonder why it was called the fault in our stars even though hazel said there was no fault in the stars. I believe it was a metaphor. I very much liked the ending and how it ended with a letter from Gus. When I grow up I hope I will get to explore the universes' perspectives."
5," Heartbreaking. This book had some lovely characters - Hazel and Augustus were well developed, authentic, and intelligent. The book seemed to give an honest and raw look at what it must be like to be young and dying of cancer. It made me think about grief, an afterlife, and the ways we deal or don't deal with the horrific pain of loss or impending loss. There were some parts that were somewhat disjointed and didn't quite connect with me. Hazel and Augustus individually were great characters, but their love story seemed to be one-sided and fell flat somewhat. The author was able to convey the depth and intensity of Gus's love for Hazel but I didn't quite get that impression from Hazel. While it was clear she was attached to him, I didn't quite feel it. Her struggle to deal with her own mortality seemed really authentic though. Her struggle revealed someone who genuinely cared about others and her effect on them. She really was distraught at the thought of harming others, especially if she died. It is easy to see why Augustus loved her so much. Her relationship with her parents was beautiful and the epitome of loving and supportive along with the genuine struggle of caring for a dying child. There was some beautiful, intelligent writing here - definitely worth the read. Just get ready to have your heart broken."
5," really enjoyed this book although I knew going into it, it would be terribly sad. The banter Ethernet Hazel and Gus was so vivid I felt like I was a part of the conversation. Good read."
3,"t's worth every penny. One of the greatest books that i'v read. Be prepared to shed more than a few tears, at this heart-warming love story . Can't seem to get this story out of my head."
5, loved this book.  I'm a sucker for anything that will make me cry.  Having a friend with brain cancer made this an even more personal experience.  I would recommend this book to anyone.
5,t was a very good read! I am glad I purchased it on my Kindle because I was looking up words quite frequently! These teenagers speak very eloquently. It almost takes you out of the book.
2, This book is a great get lost in it type book. I could not put it done until it was finished. Cannot wait for the movie to come out but I don't think it can do the book justice.
4, OMG I LAUGHED CRIED AND SMILED I LOVE THIS BOOK IT IS AMAZING AND GREAT AND I SUGGEST IT! Ok so I read it in 3 days and I'm the type of person who NEVER reads fast so that means it's good
5, can not stop thinking about this book! I hope the author does a sequel of this book so we do not end up like Hazel Grace and become obsessed with knowing what happens to the characters.
5, loved everything about this book.  The conversations between Gus and Hazel are somehow fun and sad at the same time.  Mr. Green does a wonderful job of portraying teen hearts and minds.
5," This book was a lovely, easy read. It presented real life issues in a remarkable and humorous, yet not inappropriate way. I loved every second of it and would recommend it in a heartbeat."
5," This book is amazing and a tear jerker for all of the right reasons! john Green has done it again, and I can't wait until the movie  comes, and hopefully it will do the book some justice."
5," Don't simply dismiss this story as teen melodrama. Savor the language, the heartbreak, and masterful plot. No spoilers here, so I will just say this is one I will revisit again and again."
5," This is a perfectly amazing book. I loved the dialogue and the chemistry that the characters shared.  It was sad without being too sad. Such a wonderful read, even for an adult (like me!)"
5, This book was very sad to read but it also made you take a look at your own life and be grateful for what you do have. The ending was my favorite part so beautiful and tragic. Great read!
5," The Fault In Our Stars by John Green was Out of this World.You may laugh, cry or sob... I'm not going to go to much in detail because I would give it all away.Okay?Okay."
2, loved the characters in this book.  I work with cancer patients and I thought the author did an excellent job conveying a more accurate depiction of how at least some patients may feel.
5," started the love month with this heart-warming book on hope, survival and on finding true love amidst heart-breaking challenges. I literally cried on this novel. :) A very good read. :)"
5," book arrived on time and in perfect condition!!  I was very happy with everything!!  This is a really good book, too - different subject matter but so well written and thought provoking!!"
5," Real life.  If you have ever had, or loved someone with cancer or a critical illness, this book will bring all those challenges, heartbreaks, strength, and hope right back into your soul."
5," Sucks you in almost immediately and takes you on a roller coaster full of emotions. Can't help but fall in love with the characters - witty, intellectual, honest. Definitely worth a read."
5," have nothing other to say than that this was truly fantastic.This review requires me to use more words, so I'll just say that I am looking forward to reading more of Green's work."
5," This book...well that is a far to typical way to start a book review. So instead I shall say this: I did not give much thought to the truths of dying. I am not dying, nor is any one close to me dying in the same way  Hazel and Augustus were dying. But then a thought that most often remains in the back of my mind comes into a dim light: we are all dying. Ha know hasn't that been said before. Well I am not going to say that this book perfectly illustrates the life of someone with cancer, because I have no idea if it truly does or not. But I will say that I think John Green must have got pretty close, because at every moment I could feel Hazel's pain.  In many ways this book tried to stress that once you get cancer, people only see the cancer, as if instead of it just being another thing about you, it is you. In some ways John Green really opened my eyes and I hope others to the fact it's not all about the cancer. Green had other layers to the book: a love story, the binding of a family, and many other details that definitely made me feel like I was in the book. Not merely reading another sad story of a young girl with cancer.  I recommend this book to anyone who feels they need a new opinion on some parts of life and how we relate to the universe, and anyone who needs to know a fault in our stars."
5, This is such an impeccable book; the emotional attachments are everlasting. John Green deserves endless rewards for his writing. I believe everyone should experience this marvelous book.
5," Really enjoyed this book.  I was worried the ending would be too maudlin, but it was nicely done.  Realistic.  If a book makes me think about it for days after it was well worth reading."
5," A book that was hard for me to put down. Even though the subject matter was sad-young people with terminal cancer, the author made me see &amp;understand so much more. I recommend it highly."
2, This book is such a good book. I love that there is a story of a girl with cancer but living her life normally. It is a sad story but a very good one. I am very glad I read this book. :)
4, loved this block it kept my attention the whole Tim  I never put it down it made me laugh an  cry an  it was just so amazing I don't know what to say other then that you have trad this
5, love how real this book is. It gives you the perspective from eyes in which you would not otherwise see. I laughed and cried right along with the characters. Story well told.
5, read this book because it was my book clubs choice. It is an interesting look at a teenage girl's journey while living with cancer. The characters she encounters make it a great story!
5," my granddaughter reccomended this book to me. she is 15. As I understand, it was a required reading for one of her classes.there is a great deal of depth and a whole lot to ponder."
5," When you're left with infinite thoughts bouncing in your head about the underlying meaning and characters you do not know, you know you've read something worth while. Indeed, worthwhile!"
5,ve never read a story from the point of view of a person with cancer. I never knew the thought process. This book makes me appreciate my life even more. Everyone should read this book.
5," This book goes beyond my words. Nothing I write, type or think in comparison of this book will be enough for it. I am many of those who cried. I mean bawled like a baby. (MINISPOILER ALERT) After he said I lit up like a Christmas tree you already knew.I am only 14 so some of this book took time to comprehend though I may say I read it in one day. I felt like they weren't present  today teenagers. I will not complain about that because  it made it far more interesting and it made them different and special. I also spent time preparing my self for the sadness of so I thought what would come of it. But I did not. It made me see things in a new perspective, made me think outside the box. I was touched, not just emotional but intellectually. John green is genius and if you disagree, so be it, lol. I would recommend this book to any of my friends or family members because  it deserves that much.So thank you to other reviews that convinced me to get this book and to the phenomenal characters who I will never forget. Beautiful Augustus Waters and Hazel Grace Lancaster. And last but not least just how she was eager to find out the ending of Anna's story, I want to know hers. I will not have closure until so. Okay I'm not done. Last thing I promise, I wish it would have had both POV's."
5," What a truly well-written book. I love the sharp humor and the rich vocabulary and the poignant sarcasm John Green uses in The Fault in Our Stars. This is a young adult book, but Gus and Hazel are mature beyond their years, partly due to the struggles they've endured in their short lifetimes. The book is emotional but it didn't shatter me like I thought it would, probably because Hazel and Gus handle all of the issues in such a mature and matter-of-fact manner.This novel evokes many questions which it leaves up to the reader to answer...What happens after we die? Is love truly just 'a shout into the void'? If so, is love worth the pain it seems to inevitably cause? John Green doesn't answer this for us in the novel, but gives us the story and leaves it up to us to determine our own answers. And maybe that's the point...maybe there are no predetermined answers here...maybe the answer is different for each and every one of us.We're as likely to hurt the universe as we are to help it, and we're not likely to do either.All salvation is temporary...I bought them a minute. Maybe that's the minute that buys them an hour, which is the hour that buys them a year. No one's gonna buy them forever, but my life bought them a minute. And that's not nothing."
5," This book, these sacred words, are some of the best ever written. John Green, I applaud you. There is no possible way for me fully express all the emotions that overcame me during this read. I can't, nor can anyone, give this book proper justice. Which is exactly what this book is, justice. It does right by those who have been stricken with incurable, unjustifiable...oblivion.This is not a cancer book, which you will realize fairly quickly if you read the book. It is a love story, it is a tragity, it is the closest thing to reality there is. If you want the cheesy, fabricated, pretentious Everything is going to be okay, what an inspirational story, God Bless all bull, look somewhere else. This book tells it like it is. There is life, death, happiness sadness. There is no sugar coating.The characters are beautiful. The imagery is fantastic. The metaphors and messages leave marks (and scars) on you. You will cry. You will laugh. And you will look at the stars and realize that they are not the perfect, pure, divine goodness you have always thought them to be. They have a fault, just like everything else. Everyone else. Like you and me.Hazel and Augustus (Heck, even Isaac), they stay with you. Then they die, and leave you. Nothing Gold Can Stay, as the poet wrote."
2," Augustus left his mark on Hazel but also in a way they both left their mark on me and changed my views on life. Hazel, my god, you complained this whole story about how AIA ended in midsentence, midword, and you do that to me.. A cruel joke if you ask me...  What happened to your mother, to Gus's parents, to you(!), I mean did you ever receive those letters Augustus sent to Van Huton? If so, what did you think about the letters in its entirety(?), did you cry(?), did you feel angry that Gus didn't send those letters directly to you even though they were not complete, his words were beautiful like the same old Gus. Using all the right words at all the right moments.In my opinion, Angustus was the best boyfriend ever and I'm glad he was incorporated in the book like he was. He thought me a lot about life with all his metaphors. (I love the one with the cigarette!!!)Both of these can cancer patients taught me a lot more about life, and I may be like Augustus and try to make the biggest mark I can possibly make in my life. Or, I'll be like Hazel, and have a mark on the ones who care and just go along for.the ride...In the end, I really enjoyed this book and I recommend this to anyone feeling down because it reminds you that there's always something worse in life."
5," Americans are notoriously death shy. Count on us to deny that we are mortal at every turn. If there is a Fault in our Stars, it's self-inflicted...at least in part. Fate cracks our star the rest of the way.Green's novel unveils death in an especially potent way. Terminal illness, cancer, strikes teenager characters whose lives ought to be ahead of them...that is, if all were right with the stars ...which it never is on only planet on I know of firsthand.His  characters clash with fate and that makes them multi-dimensional. Each of them looks death in the face courageously; even with considerable humor, which keeps the book from falling into pity or the maudlin, always a potential pitfall with this subject matter.Green's skillful balance - wit amid crisis - is why the victims of The Fault Our Stars capture our hearts. When did kids get so with it? Clearly the age of Leave it to Beaver rocketed into something way more nuanced. Skillful dialogue creates believable people. They face mortality's predicament with lots of heart of their own and give readers a bit of wisdom on what it takes to process their ordeal.The Fault in Our Stars takes us where we need to go, on a well-crafted journey that's no holiday, but The Fault in the Stars is worth the read."
5," loved this book!! Even when my face was damp from my tears, I loved it!!! I would recommend this to anyone older then 13-14: Parents, Grandparents, Friends, anyone who loves to read!!"
4, Very intelligent and creative writing. A love story with true depth and emotion. I read this book in two days! Gives you an entirely new perspective on cancer and disease in this world.
5, thought this book was going to be a happy ending. It made me so sad. I do not regret reading this but seeing the movie will make me cry like a baby. I am thinking I will see it alone.
5, The Fault in the Stars was an incredible book for young adults and teenagers. It was a very inspirational and emotional story and I think everyone could learn something from reading it.
5,"t was painfully beautiful. I laughed and I cried. I connected even though I congregate to the cancer aspect of the book. It was just beautiful, a beautiful tale of love and acceptance."
5," This book grabbed my attention from the begining. It's an authentic love story and I highly suggest if you like to read, then buy this book. It's the best I've read in a very long time."
5," What a poignant and wonderful story. It will make you cry, so be prepared.  It was tender, and simpatico. I have a friend that  always said Each day is a blessing.  True that."
5," This book brought up a lot of emotions. It made me want to cry; It made me literally laugh out loud that I am sure other people thought I was crazy. The book was very good, I recommend."
2," Truly the most well written book I have read in a while. Amazing. The story gives the combination of tragedy, romance and comedy. The end will most definitely, leave you wanting more..."
5," 5 stars, totally pulls at the heart strings, best book I've ever read, I recommend this book to everyone. Share it with your friends, share it with your family, share it with the world!"
5," (Everything until the {#} is spoilers) it was on the day that I had been dragged to a miserably boring baseball game that I reached the part where Agustus died. {#}I was sitting in the stands, which were packed with people, and I started bawling my eyes out. It was so bad that people were giving me tissues and awkwardly patting me on the back and stuff. Then, the guy beside me (who was actually fairly attractive) taps my shoulder and gestures to the jumbotron, where I see my tear stained face staring back at me with a look of horror. I kind of had to put my book down for a moment and I may have ruined a few of the pages with my tears, but after that, I proceeded to keep on reading and crying. I wish I had enough dignity left at that point to tell you that any of this embarrassed me in the least, but honestly, I couldn't have cared less. My heart had just been ripped out of my chest by the sheer pain of the death of a fictional character and yet people were LAUGHING at me? How dare they. I proceeded to suffer through the next hour of the game, having finished the book, staring straight ahead and trying to ignore the numerous sets of eyes trained on me like I was going to break down at any second. So in short, john green literally ruined my life with this terrible, amazing tragedy of a book."
5," read this book after seeing so much hype about the movie.  Instead of going to see the movie, I wanted to just read the book. Overall, the story is an entertaining one which leads me to 3 stars. I have complaints as everyone does. 1) too much repetitive introspection. Hazel is a nihilist through and through, and this comes out through her constant thoughts on everything. Introspection is good, but John Green really had nothing to write. Every introspective scene essentially uses the same words and sentences throughout the whole book. He doesn't really get creative, just cuts and pastes practically all of Hazel's thoughts.2) Hazel doesn't' really develop as a character. She stays the sake rally the whole story, despite all these major things that happen to her and then the story ends. For making this story about Hazel, that seems like not the best character for your story to tell. Of course I assume this is intentional that some people don't change despite life circumstances, but again her repetitiveness just comes across as lazy writing3) Too much filler. A lot of chapters are just filler where nothing really pertinent to the story occursGreen told an entertaining story, but not a great one. It's ok- he will be getting rich off of it so kudos to him."
5," This book was fantastic. The world of Hazel Grace (I love how Augustus calls her that) and Augustus Waters concluded a week ago for me, and they feel as real as ever. There is some criticism about whether or not these characters are believable as high school students, and I will assure readers considering this novel, they most definitely are. I went to school with many students just like this. These students would read complex novels or philosophical texts AND play video games or cheesy television shows. That is one of the most compelling attributes of Hazel Grace. She is intellectually and emotionally mature, yet she has a love of reality television. That sort of paradox is completely believable, and it describes many young individuals growing up right now. I listened to an interview with John Green and he talks about he is not interested in writing for adults. His target audience is the coming of age teen. I suspect I am not alone in this, but young adults and adults alike will be changed by this book. It is somewhat predictable, but readers will learn and feel a great deal from this story. I was deeply saddened at times. The audio version is really well done; it might be the reason I appreciate this novel as much as I do. I definitely recommend it to teenage readers as well as adults."
3," Although ultimately a tear jerker, this book was tough and gritty and yes, honest to its subject which is often trivialized.  A quick and compelling read.  I would highly recommend it."
5," love witty characters, and I fell in love with Augustus Waters. This story is so perfectly written. It makes you rethink all the things you postpone because your time is not limited."
5, Loved this book! The writing style was refreshing. Highly recommend it. Very engaging story with inside views of dealing with cancer and relationships. Buy this book. You will love it!
5, This book was great! I loved every minute of it. It was great to know what it's like for someone who has cancer. What they feel and what goes on. I would recommend this book to anyone.
5," The characters made you care about them, and they were real.  People weren't all beautiful and brilliant, and the family dynamics were wonderful and heartbreaking all at the same time."
2, This was by far the best book i have ever read. I fell in love with hazel and augustus! John green wrote about love in a way that shows how powerful something or someone can really be.
5," only truly liiked 2 books this year Gone Girll and this book. This author is so talented., and is more in the genre of The glass castle, The art of racing in the rain...ish"
5," love John Green and his novels, and this one did not let me down. It had wonderful characters, engaging plot and beautiful writing style. This book will make you laugh, cry and feel."
5," Sometimes witty, sometimes sad, sometimes hopeful, and sometimes  heartbreakingly  sorrowful.  It has been a very long time since a book has touched my heart as deeply as this one has."
4," Literally nothing to add, not anything you even could say can make someone read something.. just read it. You just should. Still in tears. It's worth every penny I spent.. undoubtedly."
5,ve never read a book that moved me as much as this one did in a long time. Much different from his other books and it shows he's growth as a writer since he wrote Looking for Alaska.
5," When I finished this book, I was debating whether this book was just ok or brilliant. After reflection I decided the latter. It did make me weepy at times. I do get that Gus, Hazel &amp; Isaac even though are teenagers, they had to grow up so fast, their life is just put on hold, waiting &amp; waiting. Then life can be so cruel twice, just when you think you beat the odds, it comes back around to bite you more. Their life changes dramatically.Then you have the social issue,  it is such a shame but society is so cruel sometimes, it may not be intentional but it does nonetheless.Their views on life and off their illness was extraordinary. This book got me thinking, I imagined if I was diagnosed with something that was terminal, how would I see life or how would I cope?, would it be the same as i see it now.?Of course it would. Absolutely everything would changed. We tell everyone who is ill, it will be ok, you'll get through it, live life to the fullest etc etc, this book highlights these bulls*** phrases, it is easy for someone to tell a patient all this &amp; more, but unless they're going through it, you can't imagine how much they want to live their life to the fullest, but they can't because a certain illness affects their quality of lifeThis book identifies this and much much more"
5," purchased this book for my mother for Mother's Day. I haven't read it so can't really write an accurate review, but my mom loved it. Shipping was fast, and the book was a good size."
5," This book is beyond amazing. Tear jerker, but so amazingly beautiful. Can't wait till the movie comes out in June, i just hope that it lives up to the amazingness of this book. &lt;3"
5," this book blew my mind and taught me many good morals, in life we feel the need to feel bad for ourselves when something bad happens. but really, that should be the last thing you do."
2," Sweet and touching account of young love in a world of old souls. Teenagers forced to face the realities of living and dying with cancer while, sometimes reluctantly, falling in love."
5," While many works of teen fiction are intolerable attempts at literature that annoy avid readers, this book can be appreciated by lovers of any genre. This book is truly a work of art."
5," This book has wonderful descriptions of the characters, it just makes you never want to put the book down.  You are so personally involved in the story that you can't stop reading it."
5, Simply amazing...I laughed hard and cried hard.  Highly recommended!There is something that draws you in and forces you to come to terms with issues presented in the book.
4," Well its a good thing I wasn't reading this from a paperback copy because I would have ruined it with my tears. This was awesome. Long story short, read the book. You won't regret it."
5," This book is so inspirational coming from a 13 year old girl who's best friend is a cancer survivor. If you know someone who had or has cancer, read it! If you don't, still read it!!!"
5," just don't know what to say if it doesnt change your life. This book is absolutly amazing, wonderful, sad, heartbreaking, funny - all at the same time. Read it. You won't regret it."
5, John Green has done if again with this book! Absolutely amazing. Just the right amount of mushy love paired with existential thought. You can't help but love Hazel Grace and Augustus.
5," loved this novel!  Through the loveable characters, John Green portrays a very emotional and touching story.  I highly recommend this novel, but make sure you have tissue near by..."
5," didn't cry like a lot of people did, but I was really moved by this book, and I found a number of ideas and quotes that really rang true to me and connected with me on many levels."
2, cried. I laughed. I marveled at the beauty of this book. It is now filed in Favorite Favorites Collection in my Kindle. Read it; you won't be disappointed. in fact you will be awed.
5, this book was absolutely by far the best book I have ever read in my entire life. I cried like the last 5 chapters of the book. I love it and I want to read more books by John Green.
5," so sad and so good I loved it!!! okay,okay. i cried because it was so beautiful and the loved they shared was perfect. if u have not read this yet you need to because it is amazing!!"
5, This was not always an easy book to read as it forces you to realize how difficult life can be but especially for teenagers and their parents facing their mortality - much too young.
5," This is honestly one of the best books I have read, the love between Augustus and hazel is beautiful. It's an astounding book and only John Green could create something so wonderful."
5," couldn't stop reading this book, even through my tears. Young love, despite the inevitable pain that was guaranteed to hurt, in its truest form. Be sure to have your tissues handy."
5, Thought provoking and riddled with wonderful lines that leave you thinking and run through your head again and again.It was a quick read and one that I enjoyed very much.
5," don't usually rate books, but this one I felt like I had to.First, it's amazing. I loved every bit of it and it's perfect for anyone. I was a fan of The Hunger Games, Divergent, and Harry Potter before I started the book. I didn't know if I would like it, since I'm used to futuristic dystopian worlds and that kind of thing, and I wasn't sure about a realistic fiction type of read, but somehow, it was totally great and touching.Now, I don't like reviews that contain spoilers, that's how I usually get books ruined for me. I also don't necessarily like super long reviews, so I'll try my best to keep this short.Anyways, I loved how amazingly written this book was. I was pretty surprised by some of the negative comments and was a little reluctant to get the book, but I then decided I might as well give it a try. I was so surprised at how perfect this was, and when some people said that Hazel &amp; Augustus didn't sound like normal teenagers, I thought they did. Sometimes though, they would quote their favorite book, but other than that they were totally normal teenagers.Overall, this was an amazing book that was written beautifully and I am probably going to be reading this again as many times as Hazel re-read An Imperial Affliction."
5," The Fault In Our Stars is a touching story about 16 year old Hazel Grace, stricken with cancer, and the friends she makes in her support group. As one group member, Gus, begins to draw her attention to him, and Hazel finds herself wanting to spend more time with this boy, who is in remission after his own battle with cancer. The two begin to spend time together and eventually come to realize they have fallen in love.As the story unravels, readers follow Hazel and Gus through adventures that take them everywhere from the local gas station to a quaint hotel in Amsterdam. Through these adventures, Hazel and Gus bond over their mutual struggles with cancer, his in the past and hers in the present.As the young couple becomes increasingly closer, things start to unravel for one of them. The gripping conclusion of this story strongly speaks to the power of young love and the struggle that each of us faces against time.The characters in The Fault In Our Stars all play an important role in the story, and each character is someone that at least one reader can relate to. The powerful message this book sends is that while love may not conquer all, it can make a huge difference in quality of life and the way in which people appreciate life in general."
5," The Fault in our Stars is an amazing book, that tells a wonderful love story.John Green is such a talented author, and his storytelling is astounding. The whole relationship between Hazel and Gus is a fantasy tale all on it's own, but tying in the cancer aspect just adds so many more layers to the emotions that you will experience while reading this book.Hazel Grace Lancaster is a 17 year old cancer patient who attends a support group for other young survivors. In this group is where Hazel meets a young man named Augustus Waters, who lost one of his legs to cancer, along with his friend Isaac, a survivor that lost both his eyes to cancer. Augustus immediately takes a fancy to Hazel, and isn't afraid of expressing his feelings, but Hazel, on the other hand, is terrified because she doesn't want to hurt him.As Gus and Hazel begin showing their feeling a bit more publicly, Gus decides to use his one dying wish from the genies to take Hazel to Amsterdam, and meet Hazel's favorite author, Peter Van Houten, a recluse who wrote the book An Imperial Affliction.Now, I would tell you more, but that is for you to find out. ;)OVERALL OPINION:-Great bookAGE RANGE:-Girls, 12+WARNINGS:-Some language"
2," finished this book in a day, and ugly cried for approximately half the book.This isn't a good book, though. I do not recommend it to anyone who is not either a teenager, or an adult looking for an easy read -- another iteration of The Notebook or A Walk To Remember. It's not memorable; it won't haunt me for years to come -- it won't warrant much of a thought other than a passing, I have seen this trope in x, y, and z already.In spite of this, I did devour the book. Again, it's an easy read, and the plot keeps pushing forward. The writing isn't particularly good -- a little bit too self-important, at times -- but because it's written from the perspective of a teenager, it works. It's a book that turns the knobs of emotion formulaically, but it turns them effectively. It's sweet, too, and innocent.It's a book I feel like I've grown out of but, because I'm not sure I feel ready to fully leave teenage-hood behind (five years after I've stopped being one), I can't help letting myself fall back into it.And, finally, the thing I love about easy books is that it lets me devour books again. I can rush through them, tearing through pages, without much thought -- something that I often cannot do with other, more adult books."
5," Hazel has terminal cancer that has forced her out of school. Despite her desire to stay inside reading, sleeping and watching television, her Mom forces her to get out and go to Support Group each week. It is there that she meets Augustus Waters, a boy who has been cancer-free for close to a year. He has a different outlook on life and with his unlit cigarette, he plans on making Hazel Grace’s life broader and brighter.Written in a first-person narrative, John Green has created a poetic and powerful novel.  This book has a dark, realistic beginning, but quickly it sweeps the characters and readers up into a majestic fantasy. The author focuses on how cancer affects the patient, but also how it affects everyone. Knowing the end result, means grief is a daily experience for all, but the choice is to continue living life for however long it exists. Brimming with references to another heart wrenching, fictional tale, Green manages to tell an additional story within this one, to help foreshadow the growth of his main characters. Readers will cry and laugh as they fall in love with Hazel Grace, Augustus and Isaac.Notes:This review was written for My Sister’s Books.This review was originally posted on the Ariesgrl Book Reviews website."
3," This author is one of my favorites and his writing is far beyond great. It's amazing, marvelous, fantastic, fabulous. This book may not have me cry, but the story is truly touching."
5, Loved it all! It was the best book I ever read! I would suggest this to a friend! I almost started crying in the middle! I'm not telling you when. I'm not a spoiler! READ THIS BOOK!
5," had no clue what I was about to read. my granddaughter tested me telling I had to read this book, so I did just that. I couldn't put it down, it made me mad, cry, laugh, and hope."
5, A sensitive and insightful  good overall story that gives a glimpse into the lives of young people facing death and the limitations life provides when faced with issues with health.
5, Loved it.  There are very few books that I would want to read and read again but this is one.  The writing was so colorful I even added the Netherlands to my must go list.
4, Loved this book! My teenage daughter also loved it and told all her friends to read it also. A different and sweet love story! Easy to read and I was into it from the 1st few pages!
5," This book had me in stitches of laughter, fits of anger and a river of tears. So very well written and perfectly executed that you can only love this book and the characters inside."
5, loved this book. It captured all the real properties of what it would be like to have that disease. John Green is one of the best authors. I can't wait for his new books. 5 stars.
2, Seriously and honestly fell in love with this beautifully written book. I read and read for almost 24 hrs straight until I finished it. Just could not put it down. Bravo John green!
5, Time magazine was correct in calling this book the best book of 2012.  It is a heartbreakingly beautiful must-read.  Stop reading this review and start reading the book...
5," Well it's official, Gus has stolen my heart... What an amazing, inspirational character... I am just taken back by these two and wish there were more of them in this hateful world.."
5," My teenage daughter was wondering what book I was reading that I didn't want to be interrupted.  When I was done with the book, she read it and didn't want to be interrupted either!"
5," Anyone who is even glancing at this book should read it!  It was so heart-felt and well-written!  I pass it on to everyone!  John Green wrote a fantastic book, I absolutely love it!"
5," A truly spectacular novel, beautifully written and makes you wonder about the meaning of life itself. The characters are well-developed and relatable. Another triumph by John Green."
5," elected to read The Fault in Our Stars by John Green because, truthfully, I just wanted to see what all the hype was about. With all the buzz around the new movie, not to mention the large amount of teenage girls raving about tear-jerking love story, it’s almost impossible to avoid hearing about it.After staining the last few pages with teardrops, I had completed the ever so popular book. I would absolutely recommend The Fault in Our Stars to anyone in need of a good book, a good cry, or simply a good story. The main character Hazel is very easy to relate to and I fell in love with Augustus Waters. I would recommend this book for anyone who would enjoy a story about a romantic journey that incorporates the harsh realities of real life.This book definitely exceeded my expectations. I thought it was just going to be another stereotypical, sappy, love story with a happy ending but it had a unique twist on the regular love story plot that I think is what most readers love about it. In addition, John Green's writing style is different, sophisticated, and beautiful, and he presents a gift that you see very scarcely these days.Even if you think this book isn't for you, give it a try because it just might surprise you. :)-Emily"
5," The Terrific:- millions of young people read this book; anything that gets people into literature is a very good thing- the author does not glorify death or cover up the horrors of most cancer deaths; young readers (all readers really) need to confront realities rather than romanticized and perverted versions of it- the characters actually have sex and it is positive and natural; the author again does not ignore the real lives of adolescents or make judgments about sex- there are many poignant moments and quotes throughout the text- it is a good, thoughtful, and nice textThe Bad:- the main characters wax philosophic far too often and they do so with a wisdom and vocabulary that are out of place- these same characters are afforded insights beyond their age, experiences, etc. at the cost of almost all of the adults appearing dimwitted (is there no wisdom from age/experience?)- the characters claim not to want to be identified by their cancers but repeatedly identify themselves this way (similarly, their diagnoses seems to give them some preternatural insights)- Green vacillates between nice writing and really bad prose (tons of dangling and misplaced modifiers, bad dialogue ... I said...he said...)."
5, Adults and young adults...this should be required reading. Beautifully written. I don't even want to see the movie because there is no way it could convey as much beauty and heart.
5," excellently written, perfectly structured and simply the best book i've ever read. this will make you cry, laugh, and feel every emotion possible. i highly recommend you read this!"
2," Omg The Fault In Our Stars is an amazing book. You will experience love like never before, and this book will make you look at the word okay in a different way."
5,m still recovering from the pool of tears I have  recently drowned myself in over the past five chapters. John Green is an utter genius. And this book...just no words. Brilliant.
5," Any good book makes you feel things for its characters, and John Green definitely does an amazing job with that in this book! Love this book and can not wait till the movie is out!"
5," Not a pick me up, feel good book but truly depicts the heartache and struggles many go through everyday dealing with cancer!!! The characters outlooks on life are heroic!"
5," Read it in one afternoon as I couldn't put it down.  Fell in love with the characters, laugh, cried.  I can't remember the last book I read that took me through this many emotions!"
4,t was a-pleasure to read and most enjoyable. I would recommend to all to get this to read and enjoy.  I enjoyed so much--that am thinking about get another in the near future.----
5," This book is sad... but truly a great love story that is based on reality not a vampire flying into your bedroom window. I absolutely loved it, I will really miss these characters."
5," One of the greatest books I have ever read. Every line fits, every moment is perfect, and every punctuation mark has meaning. The characters are lovable and so unique. A must read."

5, This book was PhenomiNIALL. Its just breathtaking. Hazels and Augustus love story unravels beautifully in front of you. It will bring you tears and opens your eyes about the world.
2," Reading this book felt real, as if I were witness to actual events, emotions, and truths in H's life. So many emotions - beyond the basic happy, sad, etc - and really, no bulls***."
5," honestyl didn't realize it was a Young Adult title until I had already read it.  What a great story, with lovely characters, and a nice view of the world.  Thoroughly enjoyed it!"
5, John Green wrote an absolute masterpiece that is heartfelt and witty.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking to find a book about life and what we take for granted.
5," loved this book.  Although it is sad to think about death and dying, rhe author did a slendid job greating a story of love sadness bravery friendship family strength and courage."
5, This book was a very enjoyable read.  It was so well written.  It is the best book I have read in a long time.  The summary seemed like it would be depressing but it wasn't at all.
5, This is a hard book to read if you know of a teen who is facing cancer.  The don't all live happily ever after.But I loved it as a tool to better understand my son.
5, You couldhve made a little more action in the book.  Overall it was an outstanding book about life.  I would try to get people to read this book because i changed my piont of veiw.
5, Love this book.  It was well written and took my breath away.  The young characters were so well written and honest about what they were going though.  I would recommend this book.
5," Extremely well-written, funny and poignant.  Takes a look at teens dealing with cancer and relationships.  Loved all of the characters, especially the male and female protagonists."
5," This book is absolutely amazing... everything about it, amazing. This book makes you rethink what you are doing with your life, and the people who change it and make it worthwhile."
2, chose to purchase this book because it had a high rating on Amazon from a ton of people. It sure didn't disappoint. It was an enjoyable read that had me hooked from start to end.
5, Amazing. Not a book that you can put down easily. John writes it so that you want to read it cover to cover all at once. Best work yet. Even beats LFA and that is saying something.
5," My daughter has asked to read this book for a while (apparently ALL her friends have read it) but I’ve put it off telling her to wait until she was a little older. We sat down a while ago and talked about the content (language, sex, etc.) and she decided she would wait a while before reading it.I caved and finally read this book because the movie was coming out and I try to always read the book before watching a movie.  And my daughter had asked again and decided she really wanted to read the book.  I wanted to preview it first so we could discuss if needs be. After finishing I did let her read this book (she’s 14) but still feel it is a little old for her and has a little more content than what I am comfortable with her reading.The Fault in Our Stars is a really good book and I totally get why it is so popular.  I loved Hazel and Gus. Such a perfect pairing. There’s not much that I can add to the thousand of reviews out there other than to say I don’t regret finally reading this one.  It is well done.Rating: 4 Stars – Great BookSource: Audible.comContent: language throughout included 1 use of the F word. Teenage sex scene but it was more awkward than sensual, subject matter includes cancer and dying."
5," The Fault in Our Stars by John Green is my new favorite book in the entire universe. (In all the infinities) it is full of twists and turns but is so well put together. Like I said (in the title) it truly is a tremendous book, because of the tragedy, happiness, great love, and awesomeness woven in to the pages of this book. I recommend it to every one, even to boys, yes it is a romantic story but it isn't so lovey dovey that a boy wouldn't like it. I am a book lover and because of that I can read like no other. The Fault in Our Stars has about 345 pages in it, and a lot of my friends told me that I should read it, so when I went on vacation to Utah (from Lakewood, Colorado) I downloaded it on my Kindle Fire HD. I, like many others who have read it, was sucked into the world/life of Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters. My trip was 10 hrs long, although I wanted to read it  24/7 I could not so I read it in  2 1/2 days. I think that even some one who doesn't read that much or that we'll would enjoy this book. But I would recommend it to tweens/ teens. This is the first book  (but defiantly not the last) that I have read by John Green.Way to go John! Read this book today peoples!!  (Review) By: Hannah Aarestad -13 yr old in 8th grade  (12 in 7th grade when read.) :)"
4," read the book based on it being a recommendation from other books I had read, and it has done rather well review wise.I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the book.My review is more in response to the negative reviews. Because had I only read them, I wouheld not have given the book a chance.The book does use some foul words, but not as many as some people portray it to.The characters are not as evolved as some books, but are still given depth.The teenagers do not act as typical teens, but how can they be expected to? Come on, they are dying.Parents of cancer patients do complain about the livelihood of the characters, but after all, it is a fictitious story.The story is written from the perspective of a 16 year old female, so  she is obviously going to speak like a teenager, be somewhat self entitled/self centered, and is going to think she is right 100% of the time.The story does take on somewhat of a hipster attitude, but I did not see it as pretentious.I think the majority of the bad reviews have been coming from adults who expected something completely different than the idea and aim of the book, probably because it  is not aimed at their age of audience."
5," This is a story of lives lived out in a compacted time due to cancer. I will not give the line that these two lived more in their brief time together than most live in longer lives, although that may be true. I will say that their time together is authentically loving. I think that is both the tragedy and the allure of the book. Well, the writing might be a bit of a draw as well, of course. I’m reminded of that famous Camus line: “Fiction is the lie through which we tell the truth.”I applaud the book’s rejection of tripe and its honest struggle for meaning.Kate Rudd has a challenge set before her in the narration of the book: breathless but snarky cancer-ridden teenage girl, confident but sensitive teenage boy and Dutch accents. She must cry and laugh but enunciate enough that we understand her. She does all of this and more. She refers to her work as performing a book, not narrating it. I think that’s an accurate assessment. I especially like how she portrays Augustus Waters’ confidence in his pacing as well as his tone. Admirably done Ms. Rudd.I whole-heartedly encourage you to read the book; you might want to have a few tissues by your side both for tears of laughter and of pain.For full review: wp.me/p2XCwQ-AL"
4, This book made me cry. It made me laugh and made me think about the things that I have in my life that could be easily taken away in a blink of an eye! Can't wAit to see the movie
5, The clearness in which Hazel sees and is able to express her illness was triumphant.  A love story where you yourself can't help but fall in love with her.  Loved every paragraph.
5," Absolutely lovely and well written would be an understatement. Heart wrenching, realistic.  Every word spoke to me. I'm already looking forward to re-reading this, a new favorite."
5, This book is so real that when you read it you feel it you feel the pain you feel the happiness and you want the love they have cancer sucks but that support group is how they met
2," The book is truly remarkable. It's got humor, romance, tragedy and is just altogether a wonderful read. If you're looking for a good John Green book, than this is perfect for you."
5," This is the first book I've read in a long while that actually had me rushing through my daily activities just to get a chance to read it. Needless to say, I couldn't put it down."
5," This was such a good story. It was cute, funny, and even devastating at times. I really enjoyed it. It was a short book, but made me laugh and cry, which is good enough for me. :)"
5, This book is an absolute must-read. John Green has such a gift with words and this book will appeal to readers of all ages. It is a deeply emotional read that is also quite funny.
5," This book left me smiling, laughing, sobbing, and breathless in the best ways. Truly a book that I will hold forever in my heart. I cannot say enough about how it has impacted me."
5, bought this book for my 14 years old daughter. She read it and wanted me to read it too!I'm so happy I did.It makes you see life in a new perspective.LOVED IT!
5, Heartbreakingly addicting from the first page to the very last. I didn't want it to end! John Green has a way of making readers feel like they've known his characters for years...
5,"t is touching and funny and sad. I'm not really sure what to say because I don't want to give the ending away, but you should read this book because it is a book worth your time."
5, This book was well written and captivating in every page. I was drawn in from the very beginning. The story felt so raw and so real! Such a good book I highly recommend this book!
5," This book hit me in all the areas where a good book should. I've laughed, yelled, cheered, wept and grieved as I got lost in the pages of this book. This is seriously a must read!"
2," love this book so much. I have two copies, this one and the collectors edition. This copy I bring everywhere with me and let everyone borrow/share with their friends. Brilliant."
5," Wonderful, devastating book whose first chapters pull the reader though the difficult, emotional journey of a teen girl with cancer. The book is raw and fresh. Worth your weekend."
5," loved this book. I was hooked after the first chapter. In all of my readings, and I do read a lot, never have  i read such honesty regarding such a mysterious thing called cancer. I laughed a LOT, which is strange knowing this book was centered around a girl with s*** lungs and a boy with one leg. I cried A LOT. I could see everything in my minds eye, and it brought me to tears. Not only because it was sad, but because it was beautiful. Many of my friends don't want to read this book strictly for the reason it has the word cancer in it, and I'm going to have to tell them that they are missing out. They are missing out on a wonderfully written, honest book, that I just loved. It is currently 6 in the morning, and I have stayed up all night reading his book. That has to say something about a) my love for reading, and b) how AMAZING AND BEAUTIFUL THIS BOOK IS! God. I cant get over it. I can see why this gem is becoming a movie, it simply is that awesome. Thank you for a wonderfully written book. It blew my mind in good way, and not the gory kind that some of us might think. I'm going to force my friends to read this book. Augustus would have wanted me to find purpose in my life, and as much purpose as I already have, I have found a new purpose. Thank you."
5," Kudos to John Green for crafting a tale of teen love that feels real and wonderful! While so many teen love novels take the distopian or fantasy route, John Green presents a tale of two teens facing enormous challenges in life, but who manage to find a beautiful love in the midst of the pain.The beginning of the book opens to find the main character, Hazel Grace, a young girl dying of cancer. I absolutely adored Hazel with her comically snarky attitude but deep care for her parents, whom she is concerned what will happen to them upon her death. Hazel attends a cancer support group, where she meets Augustus Waters (Gus), who lost his leg in his battle with cancer. The two begin a very easy and natural friendship over their love of movies, books, and sharing their experiences with cancer.It is Hazel and Gus's love of books that take them on an adventure across the globe. All aspects of love and relationship are explored through the lens of their illness; Is it fair to love someone knowing the pain that your death will cause them?The story will take you through the entire emotional gamut - laughing aloud to crying with deep sorrow. It is a beautifully well crafted story that will remain with you long after the last page."
5," This is a sad book. There are many sad moments. In fact it would seem its sole purpose is to inflict sadness upon its readership. Leading the charge is Hazel Grace, a teenage girl with cancer. She is acutely aware and usually hypercritical of any attempt to alleviate or minimize life’s sorrows. Don’t even try to cheer Hazel up, she can see right through it!!For maximum effect, she is joined by fellow cancer patient and full-time commiserator Augustus Waters. Together they highlight, underscore, analyze, and question all social norms—from breakfast foods to funeral arrangements, nothing is sacred. They’re so intellectual! Most of their conversations sound like a university-sponsored philosophical roundtable. I guess it’s a necessary feature of a John Green book, whether teenagers can actually volley such witticisms or not.I did not expect the entire book to be about the undisclosed fates of characters from fiction-within-fiction. It’s not enough that I need to worry about Hazel and Gus, I also (apparently) need to care about a hamster. Or at least care that Hazel cares. I mean, talk about trivial. For a book about life and death, it’s not much of a driver.The rest of the book is composed of sad events and stark truths."
5," chose this rating because this book is written so honest, that I teared up while reading it.  I loved the characters and their ability to laugh at their own sufferings.  The twist are unexpected, which will remain one of the best reasons to enjoy this book.There were parts in the book that infuriated me.  Parts that made me so sad. I laughed and smiled as I read this story. Most of all it made me think, about life, love, death, losses, human nature to want to be remembered in someway but we are a part of a universe that demands attention.There were parts in the book where I knew there had to be something more, making me long to skip ahead, yet unable to miss some of the story. When I did reach the explanation, I was not disappointed.  There are some parts of the story that never get explained and I understand Hazel's desperation in wanting to know what happens to the rest of the people in the book, though the book has ended.I'm not a great book critic.  I'm just an ordinary reader. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who gets offended easily, even though the story is fictional. I would recommend it to readers who consider every possible outcome of the afterlife and to readers who believe we all leave something special behind."
2," fear I am about to utter blasphemy: I liked, but didn’t love this book. (I know, I know- you can stone me later.) I don’t really like Young Adult as a genre, so a YA book about two teenagers with cancer didn’t appeal, but then EVERYBODY (and I do mean everybody) was reading it, and tweeting how they were crying at 3am because they were so invested in the characters, so I decided to give it a go. Don’t get me wrong, I can why it was so popular – the sarcasm and challenging of the traditional ‘cancer narrative’ is disarmingly winsome, it has some wonderful lines in, like “I fell in love like you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once”, and I loved it up to about halfway. But then the plot was a little predictable and the sarcasm started feeling a bit preachy.The plot moves inevitably towards a sad outcome, but the humour continued, and it jarred with me a little. To misquote Ecclesiastes, there is a time for black humour and a time for silence and tears. So I read the whole thing dry-eyed, and though I loved the first half, it left me a little cold. (I am officially the most heartless person in the universe.) I am clearly in the minority, however, so if you like Young Adult as a genre, you’ll probably love this, and it’s pretty cheap."
5," There's not much to say about this novel, I think it can speak for itself. It is beautifully written, and I would strongly urge anyone considering reading it to give it a chance."
3," Beautiful love story that is an inspiration for life! The power of love knows no boundaries, in sickness &amp; in health pushed to the boundaries like never before! Simply beautiful."
5, Characters you can fall in love with over and over again but if you keep reading they are wrenched out of your heart and leave scars in your mind that will never ever heal.
2," Could not put it down! I found the thoughts, feelings of the characters brilliant. This is a book that will stick around and make you think about your opinions of life and death."
5," Get your tissues ready before reading this book. I ordered 4 books for my book club friends; not only was I pleased with the LOW price, but the books arrived extra fast! Thanks!~"
5," This book was great.  At the beginning I thought it was a little hokey, but as the story unfolded it built to a touching, uplifting novel.  I would recommend this book."
5, do not usually go for best sellers but this one I liked. Very well written and a story worth to make a movie . It is very sad but is a reality almost too close to us sometimes.
5," Therefore, it is inherently thought provoking, heart touch, funny, and so many other words/phrase that describe this story of awesomenessThank you,A Nerdfighter"
5, Great book. I think the author grasped what a young girl with cancer would be going through. Heart-breaking. Well written. Thanks for the look inside the head of this young lady.
5," can't get enough of this book. It is smart, funny and original. A reminder that whatever catastrophe you face, life and all its silly details will always be present. Brilliant!"
5," couldn't help but cry in the end, and also after his Death. I loved this book, but I feel exactly like Hazel did after she read her book, I want some answers! Does Hazel die?"
5," Well written, heart-breaking story especially as a parent, but enough quirky parts to make you laugh out loud. Makes you think differently about cancer and the people it touches."
5," bought this for myself for my 25th birthday. i could not have asked for a more humbling, soulful, and honest experience. this is a book that stays with you and keeps you human."
2, really did not know what to expect when I started reading and really enjoyed the story of love  and seeing viewpoints of Kids living with cancer  it was heartwarming and funny.
5," Wonderfully written novel that navigates love, death, youth and oblivion gracefully with his story in ways that are hilarious, insightful and terribly painful. I loved this book."
5," On a scale on 1-10 this book surpasses infinity. I can very easily and honored to call this my favorite book and the best book I have ever read. This book literally touches your heart. It's very hard to a book to get the title as my favorite book, because I read to books week. I have so many to choose from. The Fault in Our Stars by far tops the list. Everything about this book and John Green in perfect. He is my all time favorite author. He has such a way with words. This book will move you as a person and will just touch you heart. Whether you are male or female. Unless you have a cold heart on stone you will most likely cry reading the book. It's pretty much impossible not to. I can not even begin to fathom the irrevocable feeling this book brings to me. Words honestly can not explain how treat this book is. This book will literally give you a new outlook on life. I don't even know what else to say. Reading this book literally changed my life.Sometimes you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book.-John Green^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ that's how I feel about The Fault in Our Stars"
5," Originally seen on the big screen by the urging of my then 16 year old daughter. I was urged to read the book. The movie was an emotional upheaval of great human strengths.However, the book far exceeded the movie, as much books do to their big screen counterparts. This was emotional roller coaster to say the least. You become part of these peoples life's that Green has created. Anyone with at least half a soul can feel the pain of the trials of Issac. The charisma the exudes from from every pore of Augustus' being, and the philosophical edge that Hazel has over the rest of us. You can't help fall in love with them and be in love with them. Feel their joy, their life, their pain and most tragically their death. We are more complete for knowing these characters and the plight they go through to struggle through this harshness of life.I can not tell you how many times I cried, laughed out loud, or sighed at the pureness that was Augustus and Hazel's love for each other. I thought this originally was about 2 teenagers with cancer that find each other. But it was not, it was two souls finding each other and allowing love to dig through and outshine the muck, mud and grime that is disease. Not letting it get in your way. Love trumps all."
5," did not enjoy this book - I really wanted to, but I didn't.  I found the dialogue contrived and pretentious.  I read the whole thing, but I kinda wish I hadn't wasted my time."
5, This was such a pure story of heartache and love. This book gave me a new understanding of death and the loss of love. I feel like I'm a better person for having read this book!
1, Great read for preteens through adults at any age. The dialogue between Gus and Hazel alone is well worth the read. Evokes the gamut of emotions but leaves a smile on your soul.
5, Very touching tale. Brilliantly written and hard to put down.  The author makes you feel like you know the characters in the book which makes the story that much more emotional.
5," Every good book should be experienced, not just enjoyed. It should leave you questioning everything while being okay with not ever receiving an answer. That was this book to me."
5, Wow! Loved this book and everything about it. What a beautiful way  to express death and dying. I loved Hazel and Augustus. They were fun and witty. This book is beyond 5 stars.
2," Really liked the book, I could hardly put it down. The story is really touching and well written. It's been a long time since I haven't cried reading a book. Highly recommend!!!"
5," usually don't read books like this, but I'm so glad i read this one. It was beautiful and touching and i laughed and cried and smiled and fell in love while reading this book."
5," Yes. I did. And I laughed and giggled. This is a wonderful book. It made me think, feel, remember the seven years when my best friend, my husband Peter, was slowly losing his legs because of diabetes. He was so stoic, remaining on the job, even getting a promotion just prior to the organization going under. He retired with a disability but remained busy and devoting his time to help people he had been helping with their attempts to be successful at their jobs. He even joined me at the school district's Budget Advisory Committee and working through the pain created an explanation of the budget so that they could understand how things worked.All of this effort he expended while having multiple operations and physical therapy in a whirlpool in an attempt to stop the loss of his legs. Everything that was done left him with stumps that reached above his knees. He had a number of setbacks and was in different hospitals when his heart started falling. He never complained. He was his usual intelligent self. He enjoyed going places with the family. He would even go over 90 miles to attend our older daughter's dance studio's performance.Because of my experiences with Peter, I identified with the families in this book. Thank you Mr Author."
5," am not sure that I would have read this book had I known what it was about.  But, in retrospect, I am so glad that I did.  You see, I am a mother of two boys and one girl. Two of them are all healthy and happy and busily engaged in their lives as adults.  I lost the third one 3 years ago.  This book is about young people--I taught high school for 20 years, so I know young people--who find themselves through no fault of their own involved in very grown up situations--victims of cancer.  The aplomb with which they handle their seemingly hopeless situations is amazing.  There are efforts to avoid it, hate it, accept it, you name it.  The marvelous thing that gives the reader so much from the reading is the relationship that they build with one another--self-contained and successful.  As an onlooker in the situation, thinking that some of the situations are impossible and maybe even wrong is very easy.  But, when doing so, one is brought up short, What would I do?  What would I want for my child?  The language and situations are so typical of high school kids that accepting it is easy.  But, accepting the plight is difficult until you stop and think, this really happens!  I encourage you to read this book.  I recommend it highly."
5," Finished The Fault in Our Stars yesterday and needed the rest of the day to try to adequately sum up how I felt about this book. It touched me in such a real way that it's hard to talk about it. I can't remember the last time I read a book so fast. With 2 children the luxury of sitting down and reading is kind of a thing of the past, but for the past two days, literally every spare moment I had was  devoted to this captivating book.Not only was it beautifully written, but the characters were so vivid, and funny and honest that I kind of wish I could go find Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters and just meet these people who found their own little beautiful infinity within utter fear and uncertainty and sickness.Of course I was in tears toward the end, which is the most awkward thing when you're reading a book LOL. But what I loved most is that it wasn't this book that felt sorry for itself, it wasn't an epically sad love story about 2 teenagers who fall in love in spite of having cancer, it was about two people who refused to let their current situations stop them from fully experiencing the most epic love of their lives.Umm yeah, can you tell I loved it??Utterly unputdownable, and highly recommended."
4," Dear fellow book lovers,I just finished The fault in Our Stars by John Green and wanted to give you all a review.Where do I start? Well, first off, I'm sorry if this post includes grammar mistakes or unorganized sentences...I have been crying hysterically and my head/thoughts are a mess. Please read this book. I read a little of everything. However, rarely do I come across a book that changes me. This book changed me. John Green, you brilliant bastard! What words can I use to explain how life changing this book was. It was everything I love about books; interesting, insightful, witty, and filled with perfectly written characters. At the same time it was beautifully heartbreaking. Never have I cried so hard over a book. Never have I fallen so completely in love with characters or mourned for the loss of one. This book was everything. My only complaint is that I fear it has ruined me for other books. I will always compare books to The Fault in Our Stars. Always criticize them for not having John Greens wit or soul altering dialogue.If you've never read it, I hope that you do. If you don't , I feel so sorry for you because you will never know the beautifully heartbreaking story of Hazel and Augustus."
5," One of the best books I've EVER read! The story could have been about anything. The author's use of language, grammar, and general storytelling skills made this book fantastic! I can't say enough positive things about it. It was so well written I believed I was reading an actual account of the main character's life! I was able to picture everything described and arrived at the intended destination without being bored with useless words to needlessly lengthen the story. It was to-the-point while being beautifully descriptive without the bore most authors end up with by going into useless details. The suspense was just the right amount at all times. I didn't catch any errors in spelling, grammar, or punctuation. Perhaps there weren't any, or perhaps I was so involved in the actual story I didn't have time, care, not reason to look. I loved every minute of reading it and being there with the characters that it was difficult to put it down. O read this one faster than any other book I've ever read. Mostly because it was so involving. When it was over I felt fulfilled. I wasn't longing for more, but I felt good about that. Closure was complete. I highly recommend this engaging book. I especially recommend it to anyone suffering with disease."
5," enjoyed reading 'The Fault in Our Stars'. Though the subject matter is serious, the story reveals thoughts and feelings about having cancer and the loss of friends to various types of cancer from teenager's points of view. It is a stark contrast to the way the adults react to news, good or bad. The main characters are Hazel who is 16 and Augustus (Gus) who is 17. Their bond forms over a book Hazel gives Gus to read.  I purchased this book mainly because I had seen previews for the movie.I usually like to read the book that inspired the movie before deciding whether or not I will see it at the theatre.  I had no idea the book was a book written for young readers(6 th-8 th). if that is the case, I'm appalled at the unnecessary use of curse words throughout the novel. I don't believe it added to the feelings being expressed in the novel and because kids are bombarded with negative influences in almost every video game, movie, television show and just hanging out with friends, it seems that an author writing to that aged audience should have a greater sense of responsibility too the readers. That said, the stark contrast between how the adults and teens handle the deep subject of dying from incurable cancer is fascinating and refreshing."
5, A very well written book that wills one to believe in genuine true love. A book that I can definitely u myself reading again- each time pausing and reflecting on something new.
5," Well written touching story that was hard to put down once I got started.  Narrative of the journey of a young girl with cancer and lessons learned, life lived, love expressed."
2, Very entertaining and easy read.Read it while on a 10hr flight without wanting to stop.Make sure you have tissues handy while you read this.Deff recommend it.
5, ...and couldn't put it down. An absolutely beautiful love story between two young people and their dealings with fate. A book that will be in the mind for days. Ah! Loved it!!!
5," This was a very incredible novel. I did indeed find myself crying a couple times. This is just a beautiful, intriguing story. I encourage you to read this spectacular creation."
5," This book was one that was impossible to put down. It's so beautiful. I should have slept, I have school tomorrow but I don't even care. I have never cried so hard over a book."
5, This was an unexpected find for me.  The story takes a tragedy in life and makes it humorous and real.  I laughed and cried. I would highly recommend this to any age group 12+.
5," This novel is magnificent. It's witty, sarcastic, but most of all thought provoking. I couldn't put it down and I loved it because it make cry and laugh often at the same time."
5," adored this book. It was a very very fast read and a great story. I got sucked in to the characters and the plot immediately. I loved the story, I loved the writing, etc etc."
5, absolutely loved this book. It's now my favorite. But in have to know what happens to her mother and father. Or if Peter ever writes a sequel! Does hazel die? I need to know!
5, always love John Green 's books. I get so excited when people ask me for suggestions on what they should read next. Now this will be a nee suggestion! Great read as expected!
5," This novel was beautifully written.  It touched me in a way very few stories have and it will stay with me for years to come.  I recommend this book to everyone, old and young."
2," 5.0+ heart wrenching stars.I have no idea where to start on this review. I have just finished one of the most amazing books I have ever read and I can just tell you it blew me away from the first page.This is probably the best written book of the 21st century and I'm surprised. I thought their was no possible way a man can write a book narrating from a teenage girls aspect but I was wrong. its so beautifully written that I'm speechless. Out of all the books I've ever read this one has changed my life and the meaning of it. And I can't just shake it off. Going into this I knew it was a tear jerker and I thought this was gonna end with the heroine dying I was completely wrong and I felt cheated. Just like Hazel and Augustus I have answers, answers to the fault in our stars. How does it end? Does Hazel live or die? Does Isaac get glass eyes to see? Does Hazel ever visit Augustus Grave? Does Hazel end up falling in love again? I need answers to my questions. I need closer. I have cried for about a good 20 minutes and I know this book has embedded its self in my heart. This will stick with you and you will be forever be changed. And if you haven't read this I suggest you do so, no more putting it on the back burner"
5," like this book because it makes you think and makes you feel as if your insignificance is ok, but I HATE how terribly sad it is. It just keeps ripping your heart out...geez!"
5, This book will break your heart but keep you hanging on to every word! It is very well-written and makes you feel attached to the characters the more you read. Excellent book!
3, loved this book.  It was depressing but it is the best book I have ever read.  I cannot wait til the movie comes out.  June 6.P.S. read the book before the movie
5," This book was very touching, Romantic, and sad all in one! I loved it!!! I didn't expect it to be so good!! It is my all time favorite book and I ABSOLUTELY LOVED the movie!!!"
5," suspect this would be a terrible book to read while spending the night with your child who is in the hospital. Otherwise, it's pretty fantastic. Gut-wrenching…but fantastic."
5, really enjoyed this book. It was such a great book and such an easy read. I couldn't put the book down. I was drawn into the characters love story and left me wanting more..
4,"t's taken a couple of weeks to read this short book. Not because it wasn't good, it was excellent, it was to process the questions it bring up. The emotions and so much more."
5," was captivated from the first few pages - I couldn't put it down! I felt like I knew these characters to their very core. I laughed, I cried, it was devastatingly beautiful."
5," Even though this novel is about adolescents suffering or recovering from cancer, it is also a beautiful love story.  I fell in love with the characters.  Couldn't put it down."
2," would recommend this book to anyone touched by cancer. It is a beautiful story about life, friendship, and all the things that change when things don't always go as planned."
5," Heartwearming and heartbreaking at the same time. A breezy read with a substantive impact.  Everyone ages 14 and above should read it to learn about life, love and compassion."
5," another amazing book by an amazing author, actually can't get enough of his books! the ending leaves slot of questions still, but I guess most books to that, but yeah loved it"
5, absolutely loved this book... it was a sad story but was a definite page turner! The book is just overall amazing! I would never want to change a single thing about it!!! &lt;3
5, realy enjoyed this book. Is is a very different manner to treat people with cancer. It was not only suffering but rather a compilation of hope to live knowing you are doomed
5," read this book a few months ago, and purchased it as a gift for a friend. This book will have you laughing and crying at the same time! John green's best work in my opinion."
5," read this book after a friend mentioning the hype surrounding it as an upcoming movie. Going in, I had no idea what the book was about. Upon beginning this book, I was struck by the extremely casual use of languge that the author uses. On one hand it could be argued that this was to reflect the thoughts of the teenage narrator's naive personality, but I felt it came across as rough and unpractised, reading much like a first draught, or two people rehearshing lines of a play for the first time. Unfortunately as the story progressed I came to realise the author's flaw of developing extremely two-dimensional characters, who do not seem to learn anthing from the many obstacles they face. Perhaps this book was aimed at a younger and more naive audience, but I believe that excellent adult fiction can be read and enjoyed by all ages, yet I found this text hardly tolerable. I was glad that this book was relatively short, as it meant that I didn't waste too much time reading something that I gained nothing from."
5, Best. Book. Ever. Hands down. John Green is an amazing writer who really knows how to touch the heart. I could tattoo this entire book on my body and be completely satisfied.
2, This is a sweet story of first love that grew deep but mattered to Gus and Hazel. The story was sad but uplifting too. You will want to celebrate life rather the begrudge it.
5,"t was a lovely book that made you think about life and everyone in it. It made you laugh, cry, and almost always want more. It's a definite page turner, I read it in 2 days."
4," This book was great, it teaches you the hard love/life young adults go through and parents when someone has a deadly disease. Brought tears to my eyes. Great book hands down!"
5, Everyone should read this book at first I thought this book would be boring yet I love this book so much and can't wait to go see the movie when it comes out June 6th 2014 :)
5," have never read a book as quick as I read this one. I couldn't stop reading it actually, late nights and early mornings just so I could read more of it. It was so good!!!!!"
5," This is one of those books that will stick with you for years. John Green is always amazing but in The Fault in Our Stars, he is brilliant. You won't regret reading this one."
5, This book is so good it left me speechless. I have no words to say except that this book was so good that it is like a little piece of heaven broke off and fell on this book.
5," Beautiful book....I loved and hated this book...if that makes sense..it was fabulously written..I cried, I laughed, I got mad... one of the best books I've read this year!!!!"
5, This book has the power to change society or at least our newest generation if everyone would read it. The most brilliant book by the most brilliant author to have ever lived
5," A beautifully woven story, with upbeat threads entwined with the melancholy ones. It was a novel written from the mind, not with the heart, which made it even more enjoyable."
2," Yes, both lead characters are young and have cancer, but this book is full of humor and heart.  Beautifully written.  The type of book I couldn't wait to get home and finish."
5," This book really opened my eyes and made me look at the world in a different perspective. Sure things might not be perfect, but that is not a good reason to be sad. Godspeed."
5, read the book in a day and couldnt put it down at all. Very witty and insightful. Full of true emotional characters being honest and demonstrating such maturity and wisdom.
5, This book is far from being a typical cancer book. The characters are witty and 3-dimensional. You are just as likely to smile than you are to cry during reading this book.
5, A rare book where you care about almost every character. Sad but joyous at the same time. Beautiful conversation that makes you wish you had such friends or thoughts or both.
5," This book opened my eyes to the things in life that seem so unimportant from day to day, but really are the greatest parts if life. Gus and Hazel are remarkable and touching."
5, Heartbreaking yet inspiring. The characters are well developed. I felt like I really knew these kids. Don't let the fact that it's a YA novel stop you from reading this book.
5," My bookclub is reading this book and it is awesome.  I am going to suggest it for my 14 year old daughter also.  Characters feel real, especially the main teenage characters."
5," This is my new favorite book, because it was heartwarming, sad, and humorous. I recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read. It was worth the $10.99 I payed for it!"
5," This was a great book. Hazel is blunt and honest about the facts of life and the world, intertwined with a sweet love story. I read it in one day, and hated putting it down."
2, This book was ever so amazing as you got to ride the forever progressing roller coaster of Hazel's emotions when. she went through the ups and downs of her life with cancer.
5," My daughter asked for it so I bought it for her.  After she read it, she lent it to my other daughter who also read it. They both LOVE it! She then let her friend borrow it."
5, This book lived with me long after I read it. The characters were so vivid and the story so real I felt apart of it. Amazing book and a very rare find in today's literature.
5," honestly hated this book when I first started reading it. I got into it, and oh my Lord. I can not tell you how incredible this book is. Highly HIGHLY recommend this book."
5, THIS IS THE BEST BOOK OF ALL TIME!!! I WAS HESITANT IN READING IT THINKING IT WAS A GIRL BOOK BUT SCREW ALL THE PREJUDICES EVERY LIVING SOUL MUST READ THE FAULT IN OUR STARS
5," finished this book in less than two days. If you want to laugh, cry, or just reminisce about young love, this is definitely the book for you. You will not be disappointed!"
5, couldn't put this book down. It was so clever- it is poignantly and realistically written. I can't believe I was lucky enough to find it to read. THANK YOU Jonathan Green!
5, This book ripped my heart out from the first page. With a voice that felt so authentic and true and a story that surprises and confronts. John Green is a master storyteller.
5," This is a beautifully written book! It is funny, smart and sad. I cannot believe the author did such a good job writing from the perspective of a young girl. Just brilliant!"
5, This book is amazing. I think everyone should read this because it is so beautifully written and the characters seem so real. I am literally in love with them! Just read it.
2," The Fault in Our Stars may quite possibly be America and even the global population’s new favorite book. I feel that this book displays a very strong message of growing up and accepting challenges such as responsibility and loss, especially going through the teenage/ young adult years. TFIOS revolves around 15-year old Hazel Grace Lancaster, a cancer patient, who just dreams of just being a “normal teenager.” The book creates an inspiring appeal to all who read it, and it has even inspired many teenagers around the world going through the same struggle as the character Hazel Grace. This book tugs at your heart, and forces you to accept the characters as your friends. And honestly, reading this book, I cried a little. But what you realize as you’re reading this story full of a rollercoaster of emotions, the tears that you cry are partially because you hold on to the characters so much, that you hate seeing them go, and also because the story really is emotional enough to cause you to cry many tears of sadness, and joy. Overall, I found this book absolutely incredible. John Green (author of TFIOS) has done a remarkable job with each pieces of his writing, but I truly think that this is his most spectacular one yet."
5," thought that this book was one of the most amazing books in the world, and I wish I had a love like Hazel's. I want to love and be loved as much as Hazel and Augustus did. I cannot wait until the movie comes out.I would definitely recommend this book to anybody. It features love, loss, and sadness. That is what I like about books. It is better than any other book you could possibly read.I understand Hazel completely. I really felt like I was reading her thoughts. THANK YOU JOHN GREEN FOR CREATING MY NEW FAVORITE BOOK.I loved every character in this book in a different way. First of a, I wish Augustus was my boyfriend. I loved the way Hazel thought about life. I loved how her parents cared so much about her. I loved that Lidewij cared about her and Augustus. I just lived everything about it. I loved how Augustus would do anything for Hazel. He used his wish to take her to Amsterdam. He wanted to write her a sequel to An Imperial Affliction after Van Houton refused to tell her what happened after.I felt like I was actually there, witnessing everything that happened.Sorry for the long review, but I just needed everyone to know how I felt about that book."
5," recently just got done reading the fault in our stars and it is yet another great book. I feel like the book touched upon different and more personal subjects that i have not seen in many other books. It really shows the truth and reality that people face in this world in a way that made it very exciting. This book immediately grabbed my attention and i am so glad that i decided to read it. I decided to read this book after hearing many other great reviews. It had also been recommended to me by several different people who enjoyed it as much as i did.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a great story line full of different feelings and experiences. In fact i would recommend this book to anyone who has not yet read it. The book had a great deal of fun and exciting moments however, it did have a fair share of sad and emotional ones as well which makes for a great balance. I have to say after hearing all the great reviews and recommendations this book definitely met my expectations. Not only did it grab my attentions i became attached to the characters as well as the story line. It was full of many emotions good and bad and i think anyone could enjoy this book as much as i did."
5,"t was okay.  Just a typical, to me, teen age love story but the only difference was the kids had/have cancer.Not one of my favorites but okay for this type of story."
5," There's nothing bad to say about The Fault in Our Stars. It deserves 5 stars in every way. I was hooked by the first chapter. I just wish it was longer. So very, very good."
3," loved this book!!!  It was so bittersweet, with happy moments that made me sad, and vice versa. I thought it was very well written, and it made me cry so much at the end."
5, Amazing doesn't fully describe how I feel about this book. Such a great story with fascinating characters. Excellent for even adults like myself. Finished it in one day. :)
5, absolutely could not put this book down.  My 15 year old recommend it and it was wonderful.  I am told a movie is coming out soon and I only hope it does the book justice
5, Quality product and book. Anything john green touches turns to gold so if you're a fan already you'll be sure to come around for another YA novel to make you cry for years.
5," loved this book. so well written and poignant. the author describes things so well, they seem real. I highly recommend it and I have bought three others by the same author!"
2," was really happy with this book, once I got it on my hands I couldn't put it down, John Green is really a gifted writer, I'm looking forward to reading more of his books."
5, loved the main character. The lovestory was not predictible and the ending excelent. It's my firts book from John Green and I'm waiting to read the rest of the colection.
5, fell in love with the story of Hazel and Augustus!  Thank you Mr. Green for giving me a story that I couldn't put down but prolonged because I didn't want to say goodbye.
5, John Green weaves an amazing tale of young people with cancer.  Very well written with great character development.  I read this book for my book club and I was glad I did.
5," The subject matter is of course heartbreaking, but it is a bittersweet love story of two kids with cancer. The characters were well developed and it was eloquently written."
5, You appreciate the simple things in life more as you share this journey with two young cancer patients determined to make their mark in this universe each in their own way.
5, Great book that can be enjoyed on all levels.  Very well written and easy to read while posing some of life's most difficult questions. I've recommend it to all my friends!
5," This book made me cry. As a person who has spent their life dealing with a birth defect, and chronic illness I get where the main character in this story is coming from. She does not hold onto hope because she thinks that there is no future for her-- until she meets this amazing person who changes her entire world. This book teaches many lessons to those who read it including the fact that nothing in the world is permanent- not even love.Green is a truly skilled writer. This is the first book of his that I have read but am hoping to hear more from this amazing author. He managed to keep the plotline realistic in terms of addressing the issues that teenagers dealing with birth defects, chronic or terminal illness, or psychiatric disorders face with both their family and their peers. For example, the fact that the main characters parents think she is in need of counseling because of the fact that she has accepted the fact that she is going to die. From someone who has lived with this her entire life this is a common response..from peers and family.Overall this was an excellent book and I would recommended it to anyone living with disability since the main character is quite inspiring"
5," am quite angry with myself for waiting so long to read this book. It was so much more than I expected and it will resonate with me for a long time. I succumbed to reading this purely because the movie was coming and I am delighted that I read the book first. While I was prepared for an emotional journey, I was not prepared for the smile that would stay plastered on my face for a significant part of this book. I am in love with these characters and I am in love with this story. I may have found a new favorite author, although we shall see.This story will make you laugh, it will make you cry...check that...it will make you sob. There is no other way to describe that horrid noise that came from my throat or the endless amounts of tears or snot that my body released. And yet, amidst the sobbing was laughter. There should be a new word to created to describe what it's like to be in the throws of sobbing and suddenly burst out with laughter. Snaughter, Laubbing,or some derivative thereof.John Green is a master with words. He is a gifted story teller and I am eternally grateful for the story and the experience. I shall not forget the journey I took with Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters."
5," A friend recommended this to me and I am very glad she did. I have never read John Green's work and what an amazing book to start with for me. The first few pages have to catch my attention and this one did. Why? This story uses a captivating balance of humor and seriousness while looking at the relationships of two young people (Hazel and Augustus). In addition, this is not your typical, oh I have a terrible disease and may die story but is  the basis of how these characters deal with life with friends and family and with each other.In addition, Mr. Green provides the reader with a thought provoking process of seeing The Fault in our Stars story  reflect similar themes that are shared in an author's work that Hazel loves and shares with Augustus. These similar moments were so subtle and sometimes I would be a few pages into the story before I would see the similarity and would stop to enjoy the revelation before going on.  This book is not age restrained and I strongly recommend whether you are a teen looking at beginning your journey of author's to love or an adult who has a collection of many author's in you library of reading, this is a book that one should read now."
2, John green is absolutely my favorite author by far. His writing inspires people to believe that your life may be not as bad as others and you need to be grateful for that.
5, The fault in our stars is a wonderful depiction of personal and family struggle with cancer. This book portrays true love at its finest. I will be reading again and again!
5, From page one each word was thoughtful.  It felt like an everyday.  This is not a glamorous love story.  But it had an abundance of love.  Love that many of us never find.
5," this book was very emotional. I never read books with cancer patients but this book was happy,funny,sweet, and sad all at the same time. Very well worth your time to read."
5," Great book, simple and out of the ordinary. A love story that I just couldn't put down. Author talks about cancer as a secondary thing and that makes the book interesting."
5," So happy that I finally caved and bought this at the price. Touching, beautiful story that made me cry so much. I have never been so emotionally involved in a book before."
4," Haven't read it yet but I heard it's a 5 star kind of book. Excited to read it. Wahoo yeah. (They made me write a certain amount of words. Hence the wahoo, yeah)"
5, The eulogy written by Augustus at the end for Hazel had me in legit tears. I love this book and I'll always take time to read it over and over again until the day I die!!!
5," Wonderfully sad, intelligent, enlightening, thought provoking and heartwarming! Every imaginable feeling can be found in this book. Take some time to experience this book."
5," This book......I don't think I've cried or laughed harder in my life. It's, tragically beautiful. I recommend it to everyone (beware, there is well.....creative language.)"
2," hadn't considered the day to day work, the support groups,the E R, hospital, family and friends and the impact on all. HAZEL, Augustus and Isaac were amazing, thank you."
5,ncredible.There aren't many writers who make me feel like I owe it to them to read their acknowledgments but John Green did that with this book. Absolutely amazing.
5, This highly recommended author of books suitable for those difficult teen years has provided another great story. Not put down until finished from an extremely fussy teen.
5, Now this is a storyWow and wow.Loved it - what a talent John Green is.  Great storyIt is journey that plays with your emotions but is well worth the ride
5," John Green is an absolutely amazing author. I started this book at 8 pm and stayed up until 330 am because I could not put it down. Fantastic book, very highly recommend!!"
5," This book is really good. Totally worth reading,don't be afraid to read because it is about cancer and death because it is much more then that. Just freaking read the book"
5," You will be ravenous while reading this book. I highly, highly recommend it. John Green has a way of making you fall in love with his characters and Fault is no exception."
5, This book was recommended to me by a close friend on one day and I finished reading the novel two days later. This is an easy read that everyone can relate to in some way.
5, Loved the characters. Started it at 6:00 last night and here I am at 1:30 in the afternoon and I'm sad it's over. My boss is probably sad I called in sick so I could read.
5,"m going to keep this review short and sweet.Why you may ask? Because this book speaks for itself. You must pick it up and read it!I laughed, I cheered, I cried.......I couldn't ask for anything more.Obviously this book is about death, cancer and teenagers, you get that just by reading the synopsis of the book, but what you don't know is how Hazel and Augustus are going to pull at your heartstrings and make you fall in love with their innocence, strength and friendship.Life is hard, but life is impossible when you are a kid with terminal cancer.I don't usually pick up a sad book, I'm a very tender-hearted person and a book stays with me for a long time after I read it. With that said, I'm so happy that I read The fault in our stars, I want this book to stay with me and I want to remember the sadness of it.I think sometimes we don't consider what it is like to have a terminal disease or any disease at all , if we have never experiences it for ourselves. Hazel, Augustus and there families really take you into this tragic yet meaningful experience.John Green Did an amazing job, kudos to him for taking on such a hard subject."
2," My grandparents on my father's side both died from cancer.  As did my great aunt.  The idea that not all cancer patients are the same is just now occurring to me.  My grandfather was happy despite his sickness.  He helped my sisters and I throw my mother a surprise birthday party from a wheelchair.  I don't really remember my grandmother very much, but I know that she was mostly happy, but also had moments of deep sadness.  My great aunt was very optimistic and strong, but cancer was stronger.  Like it is said in the book, pain demands to be felt.  My great aunt felt it.  And so did my grandparents.  This book is emotion shaped like a book.  It isn't fake, or guesswork, or one of those sentimental feel good cancer books.  It is feeling.  It is not how cancer takes life from people(and it does), it is how cancer gives emotions to people.  Emotions that are strong or weak or just different altogether.  This book changed me.  I am not entirely sure how yet, but I am positive it will help me understand the universe,who really only wants to be noticed, a little better.  I hope this book changes everyone in some way, because this book is only a good one, if it changes you.  For better or worse."
5," was in a conference with a student and her mom, and we started to talk about the joys of reading and writing. She recommended this book. At first I thought, Okay, a teen romance, but I'll go ahead and read it for her. Then I began to think about the depth of this student; her kind heart balanced with her quiet complexities, and I rethought. Okay, maybe this will be good.It WAS good. I was impressed and moved by the various relationships among the various characters throughout. And the author did well to illustrate the degree of intellect that the young amongst us often have but that we rarely recognize and/or point out. And thank God that a book about teenage relationships includes a relationships between parents and their kids that are not filled with hate and distrust. THAT was very refreshing.I would recommend this book to all of my middle school students, knowing full well that maybe three of them would finish it. And it's certainly not the case that I don't believe in the ability of my students to persevere through a novel. Rather, I don't think that most of them are ready for the kinds of amazing and deep messages that are found in this story."
5, everything in could have ever asked for and more. John green is truly amazing. captivated me throughout the book couldn't put it down. would read it again in a heartbeat.
5, read this book the first time in six hours. I cried I chuckled and I fell in love. The death of a character made me mourn and the relationship between two made me love.
2, John Green is a god and his books should be read by all. He steps out of his gender and writes an amazing book about our faults and the one ruler of the human race: hope.
5," This book literally takes your breath away. It surprises you, makes you cry, and at times extremely happy. If you love a good read I would definitely recommend this book."
5, Wow! This book is pretty amazing! I honestly love Augustus. I recommend this book to each and every person who even remotely tolerates books...you won't regeneration  it.
5," This book is probably the most brilliantly book I have ever read. John Green is such an inspirational author, and I had actually cried while reading. Well done John Green"
5," This book was absolutely beautifully written. It grabbed my heart and didn't let go, and I loved it. It was smart, witty and incredibly insightful. I recommend it highly."
5," The Fault in Our Stairs is a breathtaking novel.  I laughed, I cried, I experienced, I learned, and, ultimately, I was changed: what more could I -- or anyone -- ask for?"
5,ve read one or two books about people with cancer and seen plenty of movies but this book is different. So different and I'm sad it's over. I just couldn't put it down.
5, Children should never have to realize they're mortal but the world is not fair. This story will make you cry and remind you that life is a gift that should not be wasted.
5," Augustus Waters is confident and charming and Hazel Grace is wise beyond her years.  They are two young people living with cancer.  They become acquainted during a cancer youth group meeting.  They become friends while watching V for Vendetta and reading An Imperial Affliction.  Augustus is not shy in letting Hazel Grace know he has affection and feelings for her.  Hazel Grace just wants to be friends because she doesn't want to break his heart when she dies.Augustus uses his one dying wish from the Genie's to take Hazel Grace to Amsterdam to meet the reclusive author of An Imperial Affliction.  Their meeting with the author doesn't turn out as planned so they decide to take in some of the sights including the Anne Frank Museum.  While at the museum Hazel Grace realizes that she has affection and feelings for Augustus.I enjoyed this book very much.  I thought the relationship between Augustus and Hazel Grace was sweet and endearing.  Despite their disease they were able to express their love for each other, even though they knew one of them would be living with the pain of loss when the other passed away.I would recommend this book to anyone 18 and older."
5," have one word to describe this book: Beautiful.This book shows people the hardships of being ill, but it also shows that life and love itself is worth the fight."
2, was very skeptical about reading this book because it is all about cancer; a touchy subject for me. I highly recommend reading this book; be prepared and have tissues.
5, could not put this down! I was completely surprised how things turned and changed. Definitely enjoyed the love story of two young kids. Year jerker but well worth it!!
5," Wonderful book,  but it was a tough read. You fall in love with the characters throughout the story. I love the strength and spirit the author allowed us top believe in."
5," So elegantly wonderful, sad and wise. Simply beautiful! This book is real, raw and amazingly accurate! Powerfully written, soulfully longing ad heartbreakingly poignant!"
5," This book is perfection. I can't wait until the movie finally comes out! John Green is an awesome author, can't wait to read his other book, Looking for Alaska"
5," One of the most honest books I've read about life, love and loss (and the main characters would vomit at that trite sentiment, as well they should. But it's still true.)"
5," This book was great for my 13-year-old son and has held up for me on initial read and a complete re-read. Lovely writing, great characters, a gripping plot, great humor."
5," This is easily my new favourite book, I have cried, I have laughed, and awwwed at Augustus and Hazel Grace. This book answers the life question, and answers it perfectly"
5," John Green has a way with people. Incredible characters, heart-wrenching plot, speckled with intermittent giggles, and totally unforgettable. I'm in love with this book!"
5," Awesomeness, but I hate the ending! I cried like ten times while reading this! It's such a great book and I can't believe it was written by goofy crash course John green"
2, The book arrived much earlier than I anticipated in great condition and is brand new. I love it and can't wait to read it since I've heard so many great things about it.
5, Fantastic novel. I could not set it down! Even better reading it as a Hoosier from Indy with many cancer encounters. Touched my heart more than I could explain in words.
5, Perfect ending to a great story about being loved and losing love. A story about life and death and understanding that life is better when your with the people you love.
5, Loved the way Mr. Green wrote this book.  Felt like a teenager again.  Never felt like the characters were any less enjoyable though they were living lives of suffering.
5," really have nothing to say. Just GET THIS BOOK! It is so good,full of  humor, and events that will make you cry your eyes out. If only there was a movie to come out..."
4," This is the first book I have read by John Green and WOW!, he is amazing. This book was fantastic and so well written. I can't wait to pick up others by the same author."
5,"m not sure that I really even need to write a review for this book based on the fact that there is no praise that I can give that someone else hasn't already given, but here I go. This book was recommended to me by a friend before the movie came out, and I just now decided to read it. I know better than to wait when she recommends something to me because the books are usually pretty amazing. This one was no exception. The way in which John Green writes is absolutely mesmerizing. The only reason I put the book down was to sleep and work. This story is beautiful.The characters of Hazel and Augustus are two of the best I have read. They aren't perfect specimens and the storyline is tragic, but it is one of the greatest love stories that I have come across. It was real. I found myself making an instant connection with these characters and caring for them on a deeper level.This story is intelligent, funny, tragic and real. In one word, it is beautiful. It will make you cry, so be prepared, but don't let that stop you from experiencing this book. I am excited to delve into another one of John Green's stories and truly hope he continues to write more. READ THIS BOOK!"
5," have to admit, I had very low expectations for this book. I figured I was way out of its' target demographic, and that it would paint a juvenile perspective on serious subject. My family is involved with a long time friend in the midst of his own life struggle, and I thought my familiarity with that situation would make me a critic of John Green's story. So here I am admitting that I was wrong.I really enjoyed this story. It is touching and well written. Sure, it's full of boy-meets-girl cliché's, but the feel of the story is right. I'll never figure out how a man in his mid-thirties can tell a story from the mouth of an adolescent girl. And make it believable.The characters are very well developed, you'll find that you really care about them. For myself, at my age, I relate most to the parents; especially how dealing with an illness of their child make them a bit crazy. The kids have the right amount of rebelliousness; an appropriate amount of despair; and the kind of hope that you only see in people who know their time on earth is limited.This story is touching, funny, hopeful, and sad. It's entertaining and thought provoking from cover to cover."
5," Many people loved this book, so let me make it clear why I gave it four stars instead of five: the book was very predictable.  Other than the predictability, it was a great Young Adult book.  However, the writing was such that it can easily appeal to older readers. (I'm nearly 30.)  The teens in the book have different types of cancer.  They use humor to get through their situations, their lives.  There were times when I laughed out loud while reading this book.  And despite being a predictable book, I cried at the end.  It's a quick read for adults, and it definitely puts things into perspective when you read about some of the things many teens have to deal with on a daily basis due to cancer.This book reminded me of another that did not have to do with cancer, but amnesia.  The book is called Me Again.  This book reminded me of Me Again because I laughed out loud A LOT while reading that book.  However, one has NOTHING to do with the other.  I just thought I'd mention it if you like books where characters can take a bad, truly devastating situation and actually make it hilarious to read, even while you empathize with their conditions and/or diseases."
5," “There will come a time when all of us are dead. All of us. There will come a time when there are no human beings remaining to remember that anyone ever existed or that our species ever did anything. There will be no one left to remember Aristotle or Cleopatra, let alone you. Everything that we did and built and wrote and thought and discovered will be forgotten and all of this will have been for naught. Maybe that time is coming soon and maybe it is millions of years away, but even if we survive the collapse of our sun, we will not survive forever. There was time before organisms experienced consciousness, and there will be time after. And if the inevitability of human oblivion worries you, I encourage you to ignore it. God knows that’s what everyone else does.”― John Green, The Fault in Our StarsI am emotionally drained from this book. What fantastic writing. It's hard to tell you about the story without giving so much away. It's a story of struggle, love. and loss. This book will definitely have you taking a step back and thinking about what you truly believe, what you feel your purpose on this earth is, if there is even a purpose? I absolutely loved this book."
2," wasn't too excited to read this for book club, knew about the movie &amp; was expecting sappy teen angst drivel. I was very wrong. It's a beautiful story, perfectly told."
5, Phenomenal book. I'm so excited to see the film. I've been a fan of John Green and his brother Hank's videos on Youtube but I was blown away by his writing. Read this!!
5," Written for young adults, this is a book for everyone.  It's funny and sad, and well written.  I was impressed, and will look for more books from this author."
5," This book is a great read. Also very fast read. Tear jerker. Worth reading again. I have been touched by a few in my life with cancer...never a child, I cannot imagine."
5,t is really well written with a twist ending that ripped my heart out!! Very touching and just shows another way of looking at cancer kids! Enjoyed it so much amazing!
5," This is the kind of book that makes you wish you wrote it. Also, I usually highlight my favorite sentences of the book- and in this one I highlighted almost every page."
5," Honestly, i only have one word to describe it. And that is, Amazing! It seriously is a great purchase. I totally recommend everyone to buy it. Soo, go ahead. RIGHT NOW!"
5, This book is already amazing and I'm only on chapter 11 ! It is a good romance and sad story but makes you laugh ! I absolutely love this book (: it's a mist get book !
5," This book is utterly heart-warming, extremely humorous, but also heart-breaking... definitely a must-readI just fell in love with Augustus Waters as well as Hazel"
5," felt a connection with this book early on. It literally made me cry, laugh, smile, and brought goose bumps to my skin. Defiantly one of the best books I've ever read."
2, Currently reading this for book club and absolutely love it!  May be my new favorite book. Not finished just yet but I'm enthrall end with my new friends Hazel and Gus.
5, Enjoy your life.  Ask questions.  Be yourself.  Feel your pain. . Celebrate.  Breathe deeply and live life with no demands fir purpose.....just observe and participate.
5," This was a sweet, funny, and heartbreaking story. I didn't want it to end because I knew there would be sadness somewhere in the storyline, but I am so happy I read it."
5," Although I have yet to finish the book, I love it.  I am a little afraid of how attached I am becoming to the characters even though I know this probably won't end well"
5, am a big fan of the vlog brothers so I bought this book regardless of if it was good or not but it actually is really good. It's gotten great reviews just look it up.
5," 3.5 stars. It did what it was supposed to do. It made me care about the characters and it made me cry. It grabs your heart and holds on. There was an adjustment period to the way the characters talk, considering no one beyond pretentious college kids talk like the two lead protagonists, and not even then. In the beginning, I felt like the book was set in an alternate universe, one similar to ours but with teenagers who memorize poems and spout philosophy. Eventually I got use to it and even came to accept it.Much of the book is cliched and I found myself wishing some of the plotlines and characters in the end had gone in a different direction. I felt they were there to tie up loose ends into a neat little package and in a book about kids with cancer, it's almost a disservice to your Issue to have a nice, neat ending.But the book is emotional. Few books can make me cry for 75 pages straight. And there are some beautiful turns of phrases and Deep Thoughts. As an adult, I didn't quite get the big deal about The Fault in Our Stars. But, as a girl who grew up on Lurlene McDaniel's cancer YA books, I'm certain I would have adored this book as a teen."
5," The fault in our stars is one of those books you read in the middle of the night and finish before the sun rises and you think what the hell am I doing with my life, sitting here crying over a fictional character who died of a terminal illness before fulfilling his life with a girl he became infatuated with. Then you remember that there are aspects to this book that apply to your life in the simplest of ways-maybe you believe that eggs deserve to be more than just a breakfast food. Or maybe you have an Augustus or Hazel in your life and as you read, you realize how lucky you have it and how you should never take your time with someone for granted (or so you tell yourself, for the time being until sometime next week you're screaming at them from the top of your lungs because they did something excruciatingly annoying and you simply can't take their s***anymore.) Basically what I'm trying to say is that this book is more than just an easy read, it is the epitome of a perfect love story, under not so perfect circumstances. My thoughts are stars I cannot fathom into constellations. Now that I've surpassed my melodrama, all I can really say is that you need to read this book."
3," The Fault in Our Stars is mainly set in present-day Indianapolis. While most of the time, the setting doesn’t seem to be that important, there is one scene, a dinner scene, that is breathtakingly beautiful.The main characters in The Fault in Our Stars are Hazel and Augustus. Both are teenagers. We follow the story from Hazel’s perspective. With this book, the characters’ believability is my main problem. Of course Hazel and Augustus might be more grown up than other people their age. But still, they act, talk and think like adults and they do this all the time. Both Hazel and Augustus (especially Augustus) aren’t believable in their roles as teenagers. At least for me.I did like the plot though. I needed a little time to get going, but I enjoyed what I read, even if it was predictable. I’d really like to know what a whole classroom of teenagers would think of The Fault in Our Stars. If they don’t have a problem with the characters’ believability, then I’d recommend this book to teenagers, or adults who really don’t mind as the central topics of friendship and illness are important. However, I think that The Fault in Our Stars might be a bit overhyped."
5," This was one of the most heartbreaking stories I've read in a long time. I knew that a major character was going to die, but I cried just the same. beautiful tribute ."
5,t's really great! I love love love this bookthe ending is very catchy!very worth reading!!now i'm looking forward to read the author's other books !
2, Cute...little over-rated to be listed as Entertainment Weekly's number 2 YA pick of 2013. Not as deep as I thought but a quick enjoyable and most of all touching read.
5,n every chapter there was something special . Something strong that made me keep reading . This is emotional &amp; beautiful . I felt like I was in the book . I love it .
3, This is an absolute fantastic book that is beautifully written. The character development of Hazel and Gus is extremelly well done. I can't recommend this book enough.
5, Great story about the heartbreaking reality of living with cancer.  I found myself wanting to know more about the story at the end but overall it was a wonderful book!
5," As usual John Green makes you think… but not quite hard enough to cause discomfort to his average reader. This isn't Hamlet, but it is a wonderful way to pass an hour."
5," couldnt put it down! i started to read in my bed last night, and when I looked at the clock 2 hours had past, and I was half way done!! It's extremely motivational!!"
5," There's not a thing I would change about this book.I enjoyed it more than most other books I've read. I wouldn't put it above looking for Alaska, but still phenomenal."
5," Utterly amazing. The emotions this book pulls out of you are jaw-dropping! Beautiful book! You will laugh, you will cry. You will laugh harder and you will cry harder!"
5," This book was an amazing story about friendship, love and heartbreak.  One of the best books I've ever read.  I couldn't put the book down because it was just so good."
5," Shipped right on the release date, signed copy, great quality, great story. Can't get any better than this. John Green has created another wonderful read for all ages!"
2," haven't seen the movie so I don't know how that compares to the novel. I like reading the book first so that i can imagine the characters in my head. I could relate to Hazel having had lung cancer myself and being a non-smoker and though I was in my twenties I had many of the same emotions. But even if you haven't had some terrible disease this book is beyond cancer and more about life and love and struggle. It is not a happy go lucky tale but not totally depressing either. I saw that some reviewers critiqued that teenagers do not use the sophisticated vocabulary in this novel but that's even better as this will make people learn new vocabulary (I myself had to look some words up) other critiques are that there is cursing in a YA novel but if you were going through what these kids were going through cursing was used appropriate and extremely limited. The author makes you care about these characters and while it wasn't perfect the fact that I was bawling as badly as when I finished Where the Red Ferns Grow, when I was in fifth grade made this book deserving of five stars. I don't really want to go into any details because I highly recommend this book to everyone."
5," 4.5 out of 5 stars.Who wants to read about a couple of kids with cancer, one terminal and one not?  Doesn't sound very optimistic, does it?  Well, plunge into this YA book anyway, and if you are anything like I am, you will love it.It is a very quick read, but it packs a lot of punch.  Hazel Grace and Augustus, who met at a cancer support group where the leader talks too much about his ball-less state, are not characters to be forgotten easily.  They are smart, articulate, taught me some new vocabulary, and caused me to cheer them on.The writing is clever, and brighter than it seems 16-year-olds should be speaking, but maybe the linguistic skills of the teens I know are substandard.  At any rate, I enjoyed their interactions, I thought the other characters were well done, and Hazel's descriptions of living with her failing lungs, drowning because of them, felt real.The story didn't want to descend to the typical “courageous teenager fighting cancer and leaving a legacy” story, even though Augustus was most afraid of oblivion.  The ending was a touch maudlin, how could it be otherwise, but it was quite lovely.  I recommend this one."
5," should preface my comments by confessing I am middle-aged. I picked up this book first after buying it for a friend's daughter and then having a friend of mine (who somehow didn't know it was a YA book) recommend it. I was curious what the buzz was all about. This book is clearly a YA book, though the  teen-age characters don't seem teen-aged to me at all. Their vocabulary seems ridiculously grandiose even to someone like me with an English Lit degree. Perhaps the author was just going for quirky, or maybe he wanted to make them seem mature enough to more easily wrestle with life and death. Even so, I couldn't see these characters having sex, which is what they did. It seemed like one minute the girl was swooning over their hands touching, the next moment she was describing the navigation of condomy issues. (I do commend the author for the inclusion of responsible birth control though, even if one has cancer!) I think my problem with this book was these characters never came to life for me. Maybe they would for younger readers. But I never got vested enough to care that much. This may be one of those rare instances when the movie will be better than the book."
5," A really powerful book! I feel like I need to address the medical context of this book. I think it did a really good job of exploring what it is like to deal with disease. I don't have cancer, but MS brings with it a lot of similar 'baggage'. The endless tests, doctors, medicines, and feeling like a side effect of the disease. However, there was a much bigger thing that I got out of this book. Readers are at the mercy of the authors they love. It can be such a bitter sweet relationship. I have recently personally been dealing with the fact that several of my favorite authors haven't published books lately, leaving me to feel a bit abandoned. Silly isn't it? As a reader you give your heart and you mind to this person while you read their words, and the fact that they have given you those words can be so very powerful. It doesn't mean they owe you anything, they may not be 'good' people, they may not have more words to share, they may not even know where their own story was going. In the end however we need one another. Writers can not survive without readers and vice versa. I think this is a book that should be read, even if I was hesitant to read it in the first place."
3," You literally be drawn in to a point where you get completely mad with a part of the outcome , even though I knew what would happen it was still wrenching when it did"
4, Very good book. Would recommend this to everyone. Sad that people have to go through these journey's but these two handled life and all that came with it beautifully.
5, This book is a loving sad and true story that will touch your heart.  You will truly be able to feel their feelings as they go thru tough choices and hard challenges.
5," There us so much to say about this book to start it is so amazing!! I have so many different emotions about this amazing book. Yes, you have to read it... Okey? Okey."
5," Too bad Hazel Grace and Augustus are fictional characters, because I will remember them, not for what they did but for who they were and what they noticed about life."
5," Loved it being so fun and real with ill young people. Not only old people struggle with illness.Many young will identify with this book, thanks for writing it ."
2," loved this bookIt wasn't some stupid girly book or anything it meant something to me. It was funny, it was sad. I'm not the type who cries but on this, I did."
5, Everything about this book moved me in a sense that I need to get over my minuscule problems because nothing I am going through is worse than any one else's struggles
5," One of the best books I've read in quite some time, a compelling yet simple story that makes you relate and want to know more about the characters. Kudos to Mr Green."
5, A brutally honest tale of star-crossed lovers with a snarky twist...I fell in love with the main characters and couldn't put the book down until I learned their fate!
5," This is a wonderful book.  The plot (teenagers dying of cancer) is a bit tragic, but the characters are so real and FUNNY(!).  It is truly touching.  LOVED this book!"
5," Having lived with three close relatives who have all died of cancer I found this book quite moving. However cancer is so relentless, I also found it to be depressing."
5," Except for the fact that all of the characters seemed too witty to be natural (think Juno), it didn't take more than a chapter to fall deeply in love with this novel."
5," Absolutely brilliant book, perfectly captures the pathos of childhood cancer and teenage cynicism. Well written, excellent characters, perfect mix of wit and emotion."
5,"nspiring, I truly loved this book. I think their love was real and one of a kind. This book was beautifully written and definitely worth the cost and time to read it"
5," Except for the development of the love story, I liked this book. What an odd comment, right? The love story is the book. But for whatever reason, I did not feel the love. The “love” connection just seemed too fast, too unconvincing for me to be sufficiently drawn into the drama. I felt the same way about the movie—the chemistry just wasn’t there between these two tragic young people.So why did I give this book four stars, despite the fact that the romance did not convince me? Because no one can deny that John Green is a super gifted writer with a flair for putting words and concepts onto the page in vibrant, intelligent detail. I loved the sharp wit of his two main characters. What teen (or adult) wouldn’t want to be as witty, charming and intelligent as these two young people? And of course I loved the fact that this novel brought two young people together through a book—what better way to get young people to contemplate the power of reading?I applaud John Green for showing us all what is important: books, love, friendship, and a little bit of bad-ass attitude when life doesn’t go the way we want it to—or even come close to what we dreamed."
2," read this book because I saw the trailer for the movie and it looked interesting. I wanted to read it first before the movie because let's face it, the only movie I thought to be as good as the book was The Time Traveler's Wife. I didn't even know it was a book until after I say the movie and cried like a baby. This was a very touching story about two teens who meet at a cancer support group and fall in love. Their story is sweet and predicable (not in a bad way). Hazel is so grown up and sophisticated for her age. She enlightens Gus with her love of her favorite book. He uses a wish to take her to meet the author because she has questions about what comes next. Hazel didn't want to love Gus because she knew she was dying and she didn't want to cause him any pain. However, she can't stop herself from falling head over heels for him. I'm excited to see the movie and all I can say is hopefully it doesn't tick me off! I read My Sister's Keeper and fell in love with the book, then saw the movie and though I loved the movie and cried like a baby, the ending was completely changed. They should have kept it original to the book, it would have stayed true to the title!"
4," am a critic when it comes to books, they are my pure hope and slice of life in this cruel and under-rating world. This review might sound like any other 13 year old's review,which is my age, but I assure you; it is not.But that is not what this review is about, this review is about the book that brought ALL hope in humanity back into the empty space in my heart. It brings back all the love, sadness, and everything in between into one beautifully written page turner.This book is unlike any other that I have ever read. I had a very good friend of mine recommend this book to me, in which I gladly obliged. I instantly regretted not reading it SOONER. Before I knew it, I had fallen in love with all the characters in this book. John Green has astounded me with his creative mind and great writing. This is the first book I've ever read by this author; thus, I will make it a promise that it will not be the last.This beautifully written book is just the thing to get the tears flowing and the hearts glowing. I strongly recommend this book to all young readers such as myself, or to those who just need something to be happy to cry about."
4," The Fault in Our Stars by John Green is a quirky look into a critically ill teenager’s head.Hazel Grace is likable snarky sixteen year old with a terminal cancer. Her parents can barely convince her to leave the house until she meets the ever charming Augustus. The two quickly fall for one another despite the relationship’s impending doom because of health reasons.Augustus, or Gus, quickly inspires Hazel to not just exist, but live despite the tragedy and disappointments that surround her.I picked up this book, not because I was dying to read it, but because on occasion I feel obligated to read whatever the latest trending book is. However, this book was much more compelling than I had expected. Green’s characters definitely caught a hold of my heart, and there were even times when I had to put the book down for a couple of hours so that I did not cry. My only problem with the book is that it is very typical American contemporary writing with lots of dialogue and edgy writing. I understand that it is the trend right now, it just is not my preferred style to read. This book can definitely capture the hearts of both teens and adults."
5," This was the best book I've read for a very long time!! :DI have already read it 7 times, I've had it for 4 days.. xDBEST BOOK EVER!! WILL MAKE YOU CRY!!"
4," An amazing, beautiful, heart breaking, and heart warming, story. I am forever changed by this book. And the word okay will always have a different meaning."
5,"t's brilliant. You should read it. It's well written. It deals with issues confronted by all the living. You won't regret the time, or money you spend on this book."
5," A good story, but didn't live up to all of the hype that I heard about it.  A story that moves well, and is entertaining, just not the best I've ever read."
5," The Fault in Our Stars is a touching novel, one that keeps you glued to its pages. A book that puts life into perspective and makes you appreciate the little things."
3," This has spent a ton of time on the NYT best sellers list for a reason. John Green nailed it with this one, and mine came signed by some dude named J scribble. DFTBA"
5," would recommend this book to anyone, especially young adults. Such a beautiful story of love that isn't cheesy but instead realistic. We need more books like this."
2, This book is full of emotion and brilliantly written.  I couldn't put it down.  You feel like you have two new friends with Hazel and Gus.  A must read for all ages.
5," Absolutely beautiful, heartbreaking but beautiful. Loved each and every character. Made me reflect upon life and the things we take for granted. Beautifully written."
5," Loved it...be ready to be moved to tears, then laughter, then tears again. Especially good for those that are helping friends through a Battle with cancer."
5," Loved this story!!  Very touching, an emotional roller coaster.A beautiful tragic love story, that somehow wouldn't have been as beautiful without the tragedy."
5, fell in love immediately with Augustus Waters. I truly wish that he were real. My new favorite author. thank you for bringing such a beautiful book into the world.
5," Personally, I didn'tLike the book except the last part. Everything else is predicatable. If you like high school type of puppy love, then u will like it"
5,"t'd been a little while since I'd picked up a book and with my work schedule I knew I wanted a quick and easy read. I thought the story seemed well written enough but the dialogue was unbearable. I get that they're supposed to be smart and a bit quirky but why do the conversations between Hazel and Gus sound like something out of a Victorian novel? My friends and I WERE the nerdy kids in high school. We got good grades, we read books but we NEVER TALKED LIKE THAT. I've never met anybody who talks like that. Hazel's friend (the popular girl who has a name I can't remember) was the most obnoxious. The way she talks makes her sound like an Audrey Hepburn character wanna-be.If it wasn't for the way they talk, I probably would have liked the novel well enough to recommend it. The story was nothing amazing or life changing for me like it was for others, but it was entertaining and a few things made me think. I spoke with a friend about the book and she mentioned the dialogue too but said it didn't take away from the book for her the way it did for me. Give it a try. It's an easy book to get through in a day or two so it's not a huge waste of time at least."
1," This book, The Fault in Our Stars is one of the most heartfelt stories I have ever read. I chose to read this text for a couple different reasons.The main reason was all the positive feedback from the people who had already read the book. Almost everyone said it was one of the most moving books they have ever read and that they couldn't put it down. I would most definitely reccomend The Fault in our Stars to anyone that likes stories that are intreging, but I wouldn't recommend it to someone that can't handle a sad story. After all, it is an amazing experience to get to read about the characters. This text exceeded my expectations. Personally, before I read the text I was skeptical about the hype, but truthfully this novel is most definitely one of my favorites. The author of the book, John Green, took the time for the reader to really get to know every character. Green's writing style told the story in an amazing way, the word choice made the story go up one notch. Overall, The Fault in Our Stars is a must read for almost everyone! I suggest if you haven't read it yet, to get your hands on it and read it!!"
3," So many reviews here! Allow me to add my positive review to the thousands already here. As a mother of two sons, one still a teenager, one just a few years out of teenagerhood, I was very impressed at how realistic the dialogue here is, it is spot on. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and what a feat, to enable readers to *enjoy* a book with such a serious, sad subject. But it's a serious sad subject that is common to everyone who lives: loss, death, fear, and longing to overcome those things and  just ...live. Enjoy the moment, make the connection, savor.Is it *just* for kids? No, but the young adults reading it will probably thrum to it the most. At age 57 I skimmed a lot of video game narration. (Teens  may read and reread those parts.) And as not a lover of fiction, I skimmed some romantic poetic descriptive lyrical language paragraphs quickly, wanting to get back to the characters I really, really care about, and the plot.Recommendation: Definitely, I think every teenage reader I know would like this, and it may turn a teenage non-reader into a reader. Adults will also enjoy it, and want to pass it on to people they love, I bet."
5," This was a good book, nothing more or less. It was just too much of a teenaged romance novel for my tastes. I also thought that the writing style the author used was a little bit on the basic side. I did not agree with his interpretation of some of the poetry that he cited in the book. For instance, Sonnet 55 is one of my favorite poems because it preserves the love Shakespeare felt for the young man to whom the poem was written. I realize that we in the twenty-first century do not know anything about this young man. However, I think that we do remember him because the love he inspired in the Bard has lasted through the centuries in the sonnet. All that said, I felt that the author was making a meaningful comment on the unfairness of life and dumb luck. He also made a good statement on how impermanent human life is. I have found that humans do spend too much time worrying about their legacies and being remembered to appreciate the simple things (like floating petals, first loves, and champagne) that make life worth it. The end of this book did make me cry, so I cannot say that it did not mean anything to me. It did. I just wish I had been able to love it."
2," This may have been written for teens/young adults, but I wouldn't pass it by just for that reason! The storyline is very impactful &amp; the characters so easy to like!"
3, For some reason I knew what was comng next before it even happened.  I've read better books than this. I chose this book because people enjoyed it and recommend it.
5, So happy I got the pleasure to read this before seeing the movie I bet the book will be so much better than the movie. Always a pleasure to read any kinds of books.
3," Absolutely must read this with an open heart and a box of tissues. Funny, Smart, and moving. Plus, we all need to learn a bit more about the fault in our own stars."
5, REVIEW BY MY DAUGHTER.This book was very heart wrenching and really spoke to me. It showed us that love comes in all prices whether you are sick or not.
5," Green 's words will leave you heartbroken, but laughing. His character development is unparalleled and will leave you wishing Hazel and Augustus would come to life."
5, Sad topic but good love story with character depth. Recommended for young adults and adults.  Wasn't sure I'd like it but before I knew it I was done with the book.
5," absolutely loved this book, it was a great love/relationship story, and has a great lesson behind it. Would recommend to anyone; very easy to read and understand."
4,ncredible book and the shipping from amazon was great! John Green is an excellent writer and I can't wait to reread this book and pick up another one of his works!
5," Bitter-sweet and artistic, yet rarely powerful or compelling. The characters felt slightly exaggerated, yet likable, and the ending didn't feel entirely predicable."
2," this book was very heartfelt book with a great perspective on cancer and love. it was very sad and romantic, I loved it. read the whole thing in less than two days."
3," This book has a lot of hype, and although it was very interesting I expected more. I'm a crier but this didn't hit me. It was a quick easy read. I still enjoyed it."
5," This book was fabulous! The romance of it all was great; not too over done. Even though the book was about teens with cancer, it was not your typical cancer book."
4," This was an easy read, and enjoyable for anyone looking for an alternative approach to a cancer story.  Quick witted and a little bit sad, but a nice story overall."
5, Wonderful read and insight into teenagers dealing with life and cancer. Great story line and character development. Loved the connection with other literature works
5," This book was great. What a subject, knowing that you have terminal cancer.  I'm so glad the kids have support groups.  I can't imagine how hard this life would be."
5," What an incredible story of pain, love, beauty, and hope. Absolutely phenomenal. If you are looking for a good read that you can't put down, this is a great choice."
5," would definitely recommend it to the public.! Great book, I couldn't keep from reading it, would say something else but j don't want to ruin it for other readers."
5, loved this book it was such a great read.  You know it's a great read when your crying in the carpool pickup line.  I passed this book on to my two girls to read.
5," This book is just amazing. John Green is on track to be one of the world's best authors. This book is just as fantastic, if not more, than his other books.DFTBA!"
2," Where do I even start with this one...John Green did an amazing job with this book. Not only is it well written, touching, and heartbreaking but it is a beautifully, tragic story with an air of truth to it. John Green covers a topic that most people want to avoid because within this book is a topic matter that really pulls the heartstrings- one that could happen to anyone.Other than that the story centers on a teenage girl with cancer who meets a boy with cancer. The unlikely duo fall in love-- maybe out of shared stories or maybe out of a chance meeting that the universe provided them.Love, loss, sadness, and happiness surround this book. Readers can identify with the characters EVEN though the story is downright emotional. I really enjoyed it. I highly recommend it. I would definitely read another book by John Green.P.S -- Even though the story is of the YA genre, all ages can enjoy it. The way the characters communicate isn't juvenile like some YA books out there. Mothers, daughters, grandmothers etc. will get a lot out of this book. Don't let the age level fool you!Rating: 5 stars -- perfect"
5,"n the beginning I thought the book was halairious, I was laughing out loud at Hazel Grace's description of the support group and the people in attendance.Being a cancer survivor myself I liked the fact that she could find humor, acceptance even, in the whole horrible situation. I understand it's written from a 16Year old's perspective, and often at that age we find a new truth every other week. However, I felt like the book took a depressing, almost selfish turn.People get busy, people don't like to be reminded of their own mortality, most people can't fathom what it's like to hear the words cancer, chemo, fight, no guarantee. That doesn't give anyone the right to feel like they own the corner on caring, being a true friend, or the right to judge others who come to pay respect at the funeral. What if no one showed up or left messages, would that make Hazel feel better? I highly doubt it. Being a part of the Universe is realizing the size and grandeur of what we call our existence is about being humble in the presence of the vastness of life and space. Our time is extremely limited as is our understanding of what it all means."
5," For my summer reading, I chose to read The Fault In Our Stars because my sister recommended the book to me and told me that I would like it even though I would not typically read a book of this genre.  I also had many friends who read The Fault In Our Stars and told me that they loved the story and that I should read it.  I would recommend this book to another high school reader because today, many high school student read books that involve a love story.  The love story in this book is about two kids who both have cancer and meet at their support group and try to live the most possible normal life.  I would tell them that people that this book is about a girl who has cancer and how she is dealing with her illness and trying not to have it take over her life.  This book exceeded my expectations because I thought that this story would just be a book about a girl who has cancer and trying to live her life with an illness, but really it is about a girl who is trying to live a normal life even though things may not go the way she would want them to.  I also liked how the girl who inspired this book was from Medway which made this story more appealing to me."
3," Hazel reluctantly attends a support group for adolescent cancer survivors and fighters.  Her parents want her to be more social and she figures that since she's doing a pretty awful thing to them by probably dying young, she can make some concessions.  There at the group she meets Augustus.  He is charming and intense, witty and outrageous, and seems immediately drawn to Hazel.Almost before she realizes it and against her better judgment, Hazel is drawn into a close friendship, maybe even the start of a romantic relationship, with this boy.  She fights hard against it, wanting to spare him the heartache of becoming attached to her when she knows that she is a terminal case.  Augustus isn't so afraid of heartache that he's willing to give up the chance at a brief moment of happiness, though.This is a fantastic story, alternating truly devastating passages of grief and pain with dizzying points of absolute joy.  The characters are quirky and clever and I loved getting to know them, even while feeling for most of the novel that I was on the brink of certain tragedy.  The heartache ended up being worth it; this is an excellent book."
4," still have a few pages left on the book, but I needed to write this down.I won't comment on number of pages, the way of words, or any other technical detail of the book.What I want to share is that I first started this book, and stopped reading after a chapter or two. I was not convinced by the story. But then, a few weeks later, I opened the book again, thinking about its title. And then, I couldn't stop reading.I am not a cancer survivor, I didn't do great in life, I am not an inspiration to anyone, but this book taught me an amazing thing about love and the fleeting thing called life.The story is sad, it gets right to the soft parts of the toughest types. It made me appreciate every breath of my life, as it is given, because the world is not a wish-granting factoryI also learned about the power of love and how it thrives against the odds; like a beautiful rose grown between the rocks; like a cactus in the middle of the desert; like an ocean in between one another.I recommend this book, for the inspiration that gives and for the way it opens eyes about the common things in life."
5," Obviously I cried during this book...lol. It wasn't just a story about cancer (which is what I thought.) It was a story about two cancer patients finding love. Hazel found hope just as she kind of was losing it. She found meaning to her life instead of just thinking that it was over. I thought that this book would be corny... No way! I read it in two days without planning too. I couldn't put it down! It made me think differently about my life. Even though they had cancer they didn't sit there feeling bad for themselves. I do that now maybe because I have a cold. These two were strong, independent, and ready for death. But because they knew about death they tried to make the most of their days together. John Greene is an outstanding author! He is the only author to me who has brought so much power to me. It's like after I was done reading it the heat., power, and intensity just radiated off of the book into my heart. You will absolutely love this book no matter who you are! I really hope that you enjoy!P.S. I've never written a review on anything because I thought it was stupid , but this book just needs to be talked about as much a possible!!!"
5," For the first time in months I had time for just reading and I couldn't figure out what book to start with. I knew a movie was coming out based on this book so I wanted to see what it was all about. I was unsure at first because I did not want the themes of the book to imitate that of my sister's keeper. To my surprise it was completely different.The twists were somewhat predictable but I couldn't get over the playfulness of the dialogue full of witty banter and the ability of the author to capture what it was like to fall in love for the first time. Not only did he capture the essence of a first love, he encapsulated the fears that accompany that state of euphoria. Not only was love captured but so was laughter, embarrassment, and frustration. The persistence of Augustus is powerful but his one liners made th is book come alive for me.I am a reader that not only wants a decent story, but I also want the ability to love the characters and have them come to life with their own personalities, traits, and distinguishing characteristics. If you are looking for a quick read with a real punch of emotion, this is the novel for you!"
5," This had been on my to read list for a long time. It was recommended first from one of my son's friends who was 14 at the time. It ended up being the book club pick of a club member in her early 30's. And it was enjoyed by all in my book club ranging from early 30's to mid-60's. That's what kind of book this is. Young or old, it speaks to us all.It wasn't just the story that touched me but also the writing. John Green certainly has a way with words. I highlighted more quotes in this book than almost any other. The way Green strings words together is truly poetic.As usual, I don't like my reviews to be laden with spoilers. This review could be super long if I wanted to do that, instead it will stay a bit short so as not to ruin anything.Just know this: under the cancer story is one of the sweetest love stories I've ever read. It was a REAL love story, too. Not just a teen love story either. These kids have to deal with so many grown up issues, it had to be more than a first love type of story.All of that being said...go buy, borrow or steal (please don't really steal) this book now!"
5, This is a great story about unconditional love from the eyes of two young people that had the same likes and had been delt a bad hand with cancer. I just loved it!
5," read the book in less than 2 days. I couldn't put my kindle down. I laughed, I cried, I definitely never wanted the story to end, and I'm having book withdrawal."
2," LOVED THIS BOOK. also its so much better to buy used and pay full price for the book! Came in fairly quickly and looked just like new, and a very reasonable price!"
5," A book I did not want to put down…I felt I was in the room, eavesdropping and sharing in every turn in their lives. A wonderful, charmingly insightful human story."
5, This was a very entertaining book! I enjoyed crawling in bed at night to read and eventually drift off to sleep with a smile on my face or a tear in my eye! Enjoy!
5,"t is a great read. Its content might be disparaging to some, but the book caries a great message and is an excellent piece of literature (and soon to be a movie)!"
5, Amazing story!  I fell in love the characters.  The story is beautifully written and makes you cheer the characters on in their journey.  Love love love this book!
5," This book was so real! Could hardly put it down! Bawled like a baby at parts, but that is only because the characters were so real! Definitely recommend this read!"
5, This book is a real tear-jerker. But I loved it so much! I would definitely recommend it if you need a summer reading book because you will speed right through it!
5," cried, laughed, and fought for each character as they had to face new battles. I gave a small cheer for ever exciting moment and a tear for the unfortunate ones."
5,"ncredibly honest and heartfelt, this story will make you sob, and leave you empty and full all at the same time. A fast and beautiful read, I highly recommend it."
5, Everything John Green writes is beautiful. I would give anything to meet him. To talk to him. He is my favourite author of all time-and he's stolen my heart again.
2, bought this because my daughter and her friend recommended it. I am saving it to read on vacation. My daughter cried through 2 airports as she finished the book!
5," never get tired of this story. A youthful look at death is often saved for those who have lived full long lives, instead of those who are hijacked and cut short."
5, smiled and laughed throughout the first third of the book....and cried my eyes out throughout the entire last third. Best book I have read since the Glass Castle
5," The Fault in Our Stars is about Hazel who is a sixteen year old girl who has cancer. She has come to terms with her terminal diagnosis and now just goes through the motions of attending support group meetings, going to class and trying to remain cheerful and strong for her parents. But one day at her support group Hazel's life is irrevocably changed when meets Augustus - a gorgeous, funny and intelligent cancer survivor and the two fall hopelessly in love.Green is a witty, funny and incredibly smart author. His characters are also really smart - maybe too smart for their own good. Sometimes their dialogue and interactions are unbearably pretentious and a few of the moments that are meant to be touching and romantic feel inauthentic and contrived. In a few instances the characters are just not believable.Despite the aforementioned flaws there are some thought provoking moments and Green deftly handles themes such as life, death and purpose with a sharp sense of humour. This is not just a story about cancer or falling in love but about how in both our darkest and happiest moments we reveal and become more of who we truly are."
5," After all the reviews and raves about The Fault in Our Stars I had to finally read it. I have to say that I was very pleased with the book. I enjoyed it and thought it was a wonderful read. Like all other reviews will say it was a sad read as well. I found the book to also have a lot of humor and silliness which was actually enlightening due to the fact the book was already a sad one. The writing the author, John Green, did was fabulous. There was a part in the book where I thought I knew what was going to happen and it actually twisted around. I loved the characters in this story as well. The writer made you feel as if they were your friends who you were laughing and crying with as well. The main character Hazel was a strong character who was stubborn at times but you had to love her. The other main character Gus was such a charmer and oh what he wouldn't do for Hazel. It just melted my heart. I would definitely recommend reading this at least once! There is so much more I'd love to write in this review about the book but I don't want to give away any fine details to readers who have not yet indulged in this book!Happy Reading! :-)"
4, Omg this is my new favorite book. John green you are kind of like my van houten except u seem like a good guy to have written such a good book although hazel thought the same thing of van houten except I have faith in you to be a good person. Some of my friends found it depressing but I found it uplifting I will definitely be telling all of them to read it again and focus more on all the good in the book and not as much that augustus died. Witch though was sad u have to think what it might have been like if he had not past away the book might not have been such a good book. For example think of your favorite book there is always on self defining moment fir the main character for hazel when augustus died she could have just sat around mopping for a long time but instead she was upset and angry for a while she got over it she still loved him of course except she didn't waste her life thinking what if she knew that she wasn't going to spend the rest of her life with him but she loved him anyway and always would. I wish I could write.more but if I did I would cause an even bigger spoiler alert to anyone who hasn't read the book yet so I bid u adoo
5," My title basically summarizes this book. It's a must read! No matter what age, you will fall in love with this book. Not too long either. I finished it in 2 days!"
5, Amazing story! John Green really writes a new kind of cancer story that I absolutely loved! Now I cannot wait to see if the movie is gonna be as good as the book.
5," Besides the fact that I cried a lot, the tears were definitely well spent! John Green had me  stuck to the book like glue after the first word and until the last."
5," While we all probably know someone who has had cancer, this book really takes you through what a teen/young adult goes through.  It is very insightful and moving."
2," Amazing book, I cried, and I laughed, this book is my little window into what cancer is like. Thank you John Green, for writing this sad but wonderful love story."
5, MY 25 YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER RECOMMENDED IT TO ME. I WOULD AND HAVE ALREADY RECOMMENDED IT TO FRIENDS. NOW I PLAN ON READING SOMETHING ELSE MR. GREEN HAS WRITTEN.
5, This book was amazing. It shows you what true love is and how it doesn't take a lifetime to find out who the person really is. It shows you a lot of great things.
5," chose this rating because, it was  amazing and it has so much truth in it. This is a book I would read over and over again. It's a romance that ends tragically."
5," My first John Green novel and I really, really loved it. Not existential love, but true love. So witty and fast paced. You truly see the characters and love them."
5," Deeply enjoyed this book.  I was pretty impressed that there would be teens capable of such diction and thought, but perhaps facing one's mortality forces that..."
5, am a junior high English teacher and I can't wait to read this with my 8th graders! John Green is one of those authors that can remind you why you love to read.
5," loved this book, it's refreshing to see something actually well written when today's authors seem to have forgotten how important that is. Thank you John Green!"
5, What a delightful book full of insight in the lives of teenage cancer victims.  John Green really was spot on with the lingo and lifestyles of the young and sick.
5, See the beauty in just this one moment.  Feel a breeze.  Watch petals float through the air. This is love of the most special kind. In dying there is true living.
2, This book will taken to where you want to be. Also this book will make you think. After you finishe  it takes a few days to fully sink inn. But boy it's worth it.
5," Very entertaining, thought provoking and yet humorous. I laughed and cried my way through this lovely book that tackles a difficult subject with incredible grace."
5, Memorable deep honest and heart wrenching.  The characters are dynamic funny and infinitely endearing.  Didn't want it to end one of the best books I've ever read
5," picked this book up expecting to hate it. Excerpts from John Green novels appeared trite and silly, and I felt that as a grown adult, I should be reading intelligent adult fiction like the books that I grew up with. When I finally decided to purchase the book (discounted for my Kindle), not only was I impressed with the writing, but I was sucked into the story of sixteen year-old Hazel and the story of her love with a boy named Augustus Waters.Though I've read opposing views on whether or not this book does an accurate job of describing adolescence with cancer, I submit that the book itself isn't about cancer, or the experience of surviving or succumbing to it; It's about the mad rush of love teenagers experience, and about the beauty of an adolescent love that never has to grow up and grow past that love. This book was not (for me), about the shortness of life but of the length of love.Some eternities are, after all, bigger than others.The Fault in Our Stars is one of my favorite books, and I've now read it three times. Highly recommended for those who enjoy love stories that punch you in the gut."
5," This book was amazing, it consumed me and I finished it in a day and a half. This book makes you think a lot and it really touches the heart. I laughed, cried (a lot), and thought while reading this book. I recommend this book to everyone. This is my favorite book now and I would like to thank John Green. The characters in this book became real people to me and I love all of them. Gus is not real but I miss him dearly. John Green did an amazing job, this story felt real and it is worth far more then it cost. I am twelve and even I know that this is good literature. A fault in our stars has a way of moving you and it really hits home. The fault in our stars also opens you up to how hard it is to have cancer and the struggle. The book really tugged at my heart strings and I truly enjoyed myself. We could not joy with out pain and this book taught me that. Surpassed the 5 star ratings by infinity. The relationship between Augustus and Hazel becomes very bittersweet, if you have yet to read this extraordinary piece then you don't know that Hazel and Gus's word instead of Always (as in always together) is okay and this book is always Okay(:"
5," Mr John Green , Why did you end the book. I want more.I want to know what happened to Hazel ,to isaac and God even to peter (Did he wrote a sequel)I know i am sounding like Hazel , but that's what i feel.I just want the book to go on .. Hopefully there is a sequel to it :)I had marked this book to Read for some time. A fine day a friend told me to read this book. Thanks @Meera for suggesting this.Its a beautiful book with real lovely characters.And yes its not a Cancer story, its a story about love , courage and Hope.Gus is a hero and hazel a darling.The story of a girl fighting cancer meets a Guy who is out of cancer. The life they have , the moments they share.The small trip to Amsterdam to meet Peter.The recurrence of cancer , the trips to hospital.A lot to learn and enjoy.Awesome book , kept me going on and i did not want to finish it (Thais why i took a month to complete it)The character are lovely and well defined.Specially love the line &lt;b&gt;The mark humans leave are scars&lt;/b&gt;A 5/5 from MeDevil D"
5," Through every tear I cried as I turned the pages of this book I felt life!  Like Hazel, I too want observe the life around me, not just stumble through each day."
5, one of my all time favorite books ever john green you've amazed me(: u r now probably my favorite author loves this book so sad and I'm holding back the tears)':
5," This was one of the best books I've ever encountered. I couldn't put it down after the first chapter. it really made an impact on my life, and how I view things."
5, like the book. Recommendable to teens and young adults. I chose this rating cuz this book is so different from others and it gives new perspectives of life. :)
2, really enjoyed the main characters and their insight/perspective on life.  It was an interesting depiction of the outlook of young people with terminal cancer.
5," liked it, not too sappy, and you really lived in the characters. There wasn't an happy ending this story, but when you deal with cancer, sometimes there isn't."
5, Having a book hangover. John Green really knows how to capture his readers through individualistic portrayal of unique characters. Can't wait for more john green
5," This book is just pure amazement, and I'm saying it with assertiveness. This book is somewhat fictional yet, you can feel the tension and power the word(s) have."
5, There are plenty of reviews that say it all. This is a great book to read although it is a sad story. It might teach us to be grateful for every day of our live.
5, This book was incredibly moving and quite a nice surprise despite feeling a bit too young adult for my usual taste. Have a box of tissues on hand for the ending.
5," This book is so amazing, I can't think of words to describe it. It's such a good read and worth every penny. It's now one of my favorites. I highly recommend it."
5," Tearjerker but so well written!  Great crossover novel...definitely not just a teen novel.  Difficult if you've experience cancer as I have, but so many truisms."
5," can't say enough great things about this book!!! If you've seen the movie trailer and think I'm not reading THAT! It's a chick-book!!! (as opposed to a 'chick flick'), DON'T WORRY! I can't stand 'chick flicks', or romance novels, et. al. Now, this book does contain a love story, but it also contains plenty of sarcasm, other humor, and 'bulk'.  I don't know one person I wouldn't - or haven't - recommended this book to. It's a very easy read. Honestly, the story is so captivating, you probably won't be able to put the book down. I don't want to describe the story, since 1)I'm sure you can read the book's description, and 2) I'd rather not risk any 'spoilers'. It doesn't matter, though - you NEED to read this book! Plus, if you haven't already, check out John and Hank Green on YouTube!!! I've been subscribed to all of their YouTube channels for quite some time, and found out about John's book that way. If you're workin' in reverse, watch a few of their videos - any of them. Not only will you want to read this book even more, you'll forget where time went because you'll have put on one of their playlists and 'let 'er ride'!!!"
5," normally do not read books or watch movies that are tear jerkers, but my adult nephew highly recommended this book. Using the beforehand knowledge as a shield against the assault of emotions did not work. I had to stop reading around chapter five and decide if I wanted to continue reading because I knew it was going to be challenging for me. It didn't take long for me to realize I had to finish it. I am so gad I did! I loved how this book was written. The humor is very heart warming.I read some of the one star reviews (because I couldn't believe there were any) and saw some said Hazel and Gus didn't sound like teenagers. I have known many teenagers that were extremely intelligent, witty and well read and I think if you were to figure in a life threatening disease, you could see how they would be mature for their age. I found myself forgetting they were so young at times and felt it was plausible because of what they would have been through. And not to mention, it is fiction.I also noticed many of the reviews are very short. I wonder if it is because the feelings this book provokes is hard to put into words."
2," Some infinities are bigger than other infinities...And some books are bigger than other books...The fault in our stars shares a slice in the life of terminally ill sixteen year old Hazel-Grace (as Gus calls her). Whilst I have read many young adult novels, I honestly cannot think of another one that has affected me as profoundly as this one.If you’re looking for escapism, this is the wrong place. But if you’re looking for an honest, down to earth look into the life of young teenagers living with cancer, John Green’s The fault in our stars is as real as it gets.His use of witty humour, heartbreaking emotion and startling maturity in the words, thoughts and actions of his young cancer victims forces readers to tackle many age old questions head on. Why is there suffering in this world? Can one life make a difference, and the greatest question of all: What is the meaning and purpose of life itself?The fault in our stars is a story about love, loss, joy, family, and above all – life.Be prepared to laugh, be prepared to cry (alot) and be prepared to contemplate but don't miss out on this epic story."
5," This book delivers, page after page, non-stop.  One of the best written books I've ever had the pleasure to read.  The depth in which Mr. Green develops the characters is off the charts.  Never have I read a novelist with the ability to create such real and complex characters.  It seems that he reached deep within himself and found the most human parts, and then put it on the page for the reader to have a cathartic sharing of what it means to be human.I cried so hard near the end that my dog came to see what was wrong with me.  The subject matter is death and how the living relates to death/dying and/or defines it.  Not an easy topic to ponder for most people.  The way Mr. Green depicted the behavior of the healthy toward the dying was uncanny.  I have been that person that said truly inept and meaningless things to the bereaved and terminally ill.  How very shallow it seemed when I saw myself on that page, do that!I will probably read this book again with the intent of taking notes on the points of philosophy the writer has presented.  I'm guessing that a lot of other readers will do the same."
5," cannot count how many times i have cried over this book. it was so inspiring, so amazing. it taught me that no matter what condition, if you still love someone and put effort into loving them, they should love you, as well. and if not, then the love isn't truly powerful enough. it taught me that pain is a part of life. life is pain. we don't live to feel pain, but pain exists for us to feel. if someone in your life is dying from a disease, there is really nothing you can do but love them, unconditionally. Augustus left a scar on Hazel. it wasn't the kind of scar where you fall off your bike and a few days later the scrapes are scars. no. it's the kind of scar, that only the people you love can leave on you. Augustus did not leave Hazel. He knew one of them was going to die sooner or later. So did she. their love was so powerful, that no disease could separate them. i understand now. it's a metaphor. in my point of view, the cigarettes Agustus had represented the cancer, and the fact that it wasn't lit, represented the love. Kill the killing thing, before it kills you.This book, left such a big impact on my life."
5," As many reviewers have pointed out, this is an amazing book.  I'll just add my thoughts as to the audio CD version.  I've listened to many audio books over the years and this is among the best in terms of production.  Kate Rudd, as the reader/performer, comes across as extremely authentic and compelling both when voicing the female and male characters.  You are never distracted by anything (e.g., poorly done accents, voices not sounding age-appropriate, etc.) so you can be fully engaged in listening to the story.  And, in contrast to some CDs, The Fault In Our Stars has convenient tracks so that if you have to stop during a CD, you can easily find your place again without having to replay long segments.  Also useful is that each disc starts with the disc number and the last couple of lines from the end of the prior disc.  Not all CDs do that so I really appreciated the easy continuity.  There are 6 discs that run a little over 7 hours listening time but there is so much character development taking place that it doesn't feel too short.  This is one book that I really think gains a lot from being put into audio format."
5, This was an especially great read that captured my attention from the very beginning. Never had a book made me year up until I read The Fault in Our Stars. Wow.
5,f you want a tear jerker than read this book! I was crying the whole way through!!! My personal favorite book! Well done John Green. Well done. Okay?.....Okay.
5," This is such an inspiring book. I don't like reading that much but I loved reading this one. I recommend it to anybody. Just warning you, though, it's very sad."
5, Written with compassion and an  understanding of a real life situation. really appreciated the creation of the two main characters. Enjoyed this book very much.
4," This book is now a terminate piece of my soul. I have never loved a single book more. I fell in love with it the way you fall asleep , slowly, then all at once."
5, This book was AMAZING I laughed I cried and everything in between. This review will get lost with the others but I don't care people need to read this book.....
2," Great story that shows John Green's capability in creating characters that deal with tough issues while remaining true to friends, family, and self. Great read!"
5," A heart rending, masterfully written love story. Full of compassion and dignity. It beautifully describes the bittersweet  rollercoaster that our human live is."
5,"t is a spectacular book.  I laughed out loud and cried, neither of which is a common occurrence for me while reading.  You will not be disappointed.  READ. IT."
5, The characters in this story were so well written.  I absolutely loved Augustus and found myself wishing I knew him.  If you love to read do not miss this book!
5," was so happy when I recieved this book, didn't take too long for it to arrive either. But when I finished it.. :( Be sure that your heart is ready to read it."
5," This book was incredible. It felt real throughout. It was descriptive, well written, and I couldn't put it down. Dark humour, heart wrenching, and a great read."
5," have never cried reading during a book, but this, simply beautiful. I was very skeptical about the book because John green is a man but he did a flawless job."
5, This book was really good. I could not put it down. It really held my attention and I didn't want it to end. Can't wait to check out other books by this author.
5, This book was hard to put down I practically read the while thing in one day! The end of the book get a a little slow but make sure to  have some tissues near!!
5, This is a YA book that won 2012 book of the year in its category. I truly loved this book and have recommended it to everyone I know. Read this--it's beautiful.
2," Just heavenly. If you have not read this, please do. Immediately. You will laugh, you will cry, you will ponder life, love and disease in the best possible way."
5, Well written. Insightful approach to the world of cancer. Made me think about what young people with cancer or anyone for that matter are actually experiencing.
5,s so beautifully heartbreakingly perfect. i didnt think anything would ever match or exceed the masterpiece that is looking for alaska but this book is amazing
5," First I want to review the format of the book I had: I listened to the audio version of this, which was narrated by Kate Rudd. I'd always thought of narrating books as just being able to read out loud clearly but after listening to this I now know it's an art form. Only a few people have the gift and Kate Rudd is at the top of the heap. I almost felt like I was eavesdropping on conversations, not just listening to someone narrate a book. I can't begin to convey what an excellent job she did with this and how much I enjoyed her work!My review of this book: I don't know if I have the words necessary to describe how powerful this book was. It makes you look at your world differently and will will stay with you forever. I lost count of how many times I laughed out loud and how many times I just sat with tears rolling down my face. It's sad and happy and bittersweet and wonderful, all at the same time. Hazel and Augustus were incredible characters - so well written they seemed like real people but I loved how they also had flaws and weren't perfect. This book moved me so much I almost wish I hadn't read it but am glad I did!"
5,"d give this a 3.5 star rating if possible. I think part of it was that by time I read it the thing was so overhyped that it was impossible to come in without expectations. But I felt as if I could have told you what would have happened in the story from the first twenty or so pages. I also felt like Augustus was a fairly one-dimensional character. Perhaps that's what tipped me off to the fate of he and Hazel was the way in which he was presented. I get it, they're teenagers so everyone is over-romanticized, but the guy had no flaws it seemed. He was like that interview question about what your flaws are and everyone answers something trite about how they try too hard or organize too much. It's overkill by positivity.What i did like about this book, though, was its ability to capture life and death in a new way and present a new perspective, especially for its target audience. I would have preferred the author used real bands and authors for its touchstones, but I get why he didn't. For once, a YA book wasn't overwrought with fantasy or weird adult-driven nostalgia. It was raw and real and I can appreciate that."
5," This would have received five stars but if a book deserved a fifth star then the quest for the holy grail of books would be over.I have been hesitant to read young adult books since I was a young adult many years ago.  However, this book has proved it's worthiness.  The author goes back and forth between normal teenage life to great insights into death and life with great ease.  At times the writing is prose like and the cultivation of characters was so well done that like a painting the reader could almost touch them.When I finish a book I ask myself what am I going to walk away with from it.  This has given me insight into the perspective of those with terminal illness.  We have to be mindful that each of us is dying, just some are on the fast track.  We are not any better than they because of our health.  Sometimes the universe wants to be noticed.Lastly, the book acknowledges that no matter how young one is, true love transcends all situations.  Love, like death, is not discriminatory.Bravo to the author.  I am impressed and the time reading this was extremely well spent."
4," So with the moving approaching and my girls telling me with utter desperation that we need to get tickets as soon as they go on sale, I figured I should read the book before I see the movie. Plus I wanted to see what all the fuss was about.If you are looking for a sweet, warm fuzzy read, well this kind of fits that bill but it is only part of the story. This is a story about kids with cancer. That right there is enough to tip one off that at least one box of Kleenex will be needed. But it is more than kids dealing with cancer, it is about young kids falling in love.Who doesn't love a young love story. Couple that with some wonderful writing, humor amid the sadness, and just all around excellent camaraderie with the characters and you get a story that is simply excellent. Although intended for a younger audience, adults will love this story just as much. Be warned, your heart will break, tears will flow, and despite all odds against it, you absolutely will be hoping for the author to pull off a miracle. Nope, I'm not gonna tell, this one is a story you need to read yourself to enjoy the beauty in it."
4," Almost everything about this book is perfect. Great flow, great style, and great grammar. The characters were all perfectly developed. It was strong and emotional, and very beautiful. I have just finished reading it, and I can't and probably won't sleep all night. I don't know why I love it (present tense;), but almost everything is utter perfection it The Fault In Our Stars. There is only one thing wrong with it.  It is to profoundly sad. The whole book will eventually leave a permanent scar on my heart. Even though I finished The Fault In Our Stars five minutes ago, I know. Because I can already feel all of my thoughts pour from my heart on to my screen. I am having trouble even seeing the keys. I am wailing at 1:41 AM right now because three hours ago, from page one, I couldn't physically touch the power button. This book has only left me with one deep, question.  WHY, OH WHY, DOES:  THE UNIVERSE JUST WANT YOU TO NOTICE IT.! Can I just have one simple answer on why I'm silent screaming right now. Or do you, John Green, not know yourself the answer? I just want one, OKAY! OKAY! Okay? okay?...."
5," Where do I start? When I heard The Fault In Our Stars was a story about two teenagers with cancer, it sounded grim and depressing. I did not want to pick it up, much less buy it. Strong recommendations from friends changed my mind.I will never, ever, regret listening to my friends again.This is not a story about two teenagers with cancer; it is a story about two teenagers who just HAPPEN to have cancer. It is honest and funny and sad and uplifting; it is almost impossible to explain. How can I, with my eyes swollen and reddened from bawling, truly explain to anyone that this book is absolutely beautiful? How can I tell my husband, a man who frequently deals with my tearful, sometimes angry, reactions to many books, that I am not depressed? Saddened, yes, but depressed? Not at all; I feel privileged.The story of Hazel Grace, with her terminal cancer that requires her to wear oxygen, and Augustus Waters, a boy who lost his leg to osteosarcoma but has an 80% chance of survival, will stick with the reader for days. And, you will definitely reread it again and again.I know I will."
5," Amazing life changing book. Cried for two hours straight from the middle of the book till the end...I usually never write book reviews but this one deserves it.So many meanings and symbols, it's just... I can't even find the right word to describe how much it amazed me...I loved Hazel and Augustus -their characters, their passions and beliefs....I was so into the book and so connected with Hazel that when I put the book down, I felt like I couldn't breathe (like I was the one who had lung cancer). Even more so, when I had to climb down a few stairs.I fell in love with Augustus, just like Hazel did... I loved the way he thought and loved the metaphors he saw in everything he did...This book shows the vulnerability of a human in the pure mercy of a sickness -like cancer. It shows an awful side of reality many of us don't want to even know about... It shows the human's courage and the same human's moment of falling apart.It tells us a lot about the hopelessness of people suffering. It shows us Cancer: &lt;&lt;A war to fight, a civil war, a war with a predetermined winner&gt;&gt;."
2, amazing. can't even begin to describe the deep emotion I feel for this book. every one must read. it's not just a sad cancer book. it sheds a new light on life
5, This was the most amazing book ever. It is just wonderful and I am in tears. It's so sad and I am about to see the movie. I am preparing myself for more tears.
5," Beautiful story of love, life, and loss.. Heart wrenching at points but compelled to read to completion to see how Gus and Hazel story ends.. Simply beautiful!"
5," this was not what I am use to reading. with that being said, I could not put this book down. this story was beautiful and tragic, witty and smart. it was real."
5,t was not what I expected it to be but I ended loving it and reading it in two days. It is very heartfelt and makes you think about what is important in life!
5,"m in 5th grade and i read this book. It is the best, most suspenseful book i have ever read! There is some bad words, but they just make the book even better!"
5, This book ...............cannot be described by any other word but beautiful....it brings a new light to the way you think about the world....... it is amazing

2," loved this book!  Although it was sad, it was wonderfully charming and insightful.  I was touched and inspired. It is a great read for both teens and adults."
5," Great Novel. A little emotionally heavy at some parts, but a great book. The Audio was very good, and the Author's note read by John Green added a great touch."
5," This book is so touching.  I'm speechless; well almost.  You care genuinely about the characters.  It is smart, well written and hard to find a stopping point."
5," This book is absolutely amazing. John green is a fantastic author and I recommend reading this amazing story. You will not regret reading it, I surely did not."
5, Fault in Our Stars is a poignant story of young love. Green is a powerful storyteller leaving traces of his characters with you long after you close the cover.
5," The characters are smart and endearing.  What a sweet young, love story!  I would recommend to anyone who likes to read meaningful stories about life and love."
5, Beautiful. Absolutely beautiful.The author has such perfect insight to all characters that you can't put it down. A tragic love story for our modern age.
5, laughed.  I cried.  I laughingly cried.  The writing blew me away!  This is not a book about cancer; it is an awesome-top-of-the-list book with cancer in it.
5, would recommend this book to anyone...young adult or adult. John Green has captured the cancer experience well. Also seems to know how a young person thinks.
5," Superb story. Excellently written. Best I've read in a long time. Mr Green, thank you for making this world a little brighter by bringing us Hazel and Agustus."
2, am overwhelmed and incredibly fortunate.....I truly can't describe my feelings in regards to this book! I can only speak for myself: an ABSOLUTE must read!!!
5, This book is the best. It made me laugh and both cry. It was so cute. And I liked the way all the characters looked at things. One of the best books I've read.
5, My favorite book I've so far read! I can recommend this book to anyone who would like to know how it's like having cancer and falling in love at the same time!
5," am a huge fan of YA literature, and John Green has SUCH an online presence that I was very excited to finally get my hands on this. It is a very quick, emotional read. First and foremost, I will stay that it is an enjoyable book. However, I do agree with some other reviewers, that particularly pointed out the dialogue. As someone who is 22 years old, not so far from my teenage years, I found it bizarre the way Augustus and Hazel Grace would speak to each other. It really jarred me out of the moment. I do feel that some of the more popularized moments of the book (August and his cigarette metaphor, the I fell in love the way you fall asleep quotation, etc.) are a bit overrated. That said, I thought it was a refreshing twist at the end (spoiler alert) when the seemingly in remission Augustus dies first, and I heartily enjoyed the sometimes black humor the teenagers had about their illness. Any scenes with Isaac were particularly hilarious. Despite its flaws, I do recommend reading and heartily enjoying this novel - just be wary of the online hype. I'll definitely be keeping an eye out for the Green brothers."
5," Ooh, boy. The Fault in Our Stars was incredible. Just as good as I could have hoped, but then again, I enjoy melancholy, soul-crushing stories. Hazel is a bit like Juno from the movie Juno--as quick-witted and quippy as any teenager has ever striven to be, able to spin a phrase instantaneously instead of coming up with the right words a few minutes too late. Somehow she meets another broken soul, a hopelessly gorgeous boy who happens to crush on her basically the instant their eyes meet. John Green uses age-old tropes but somehow manages to spin them into a meaningful and impactful whole. Everything plays out a bit like I expected, but it is the shining moments--the sparkling few in the subset of infinities between the numbers 1 and 313 that comprise the pages of the book--that make the book so worthwhile. There is some serious philosophy and genuine thought that is couched in this book gobbled up by young adults the nation over. Hopefully readers are keen enough to slow down and take them in--and then are inspired to slow down in their own lives and take in their moments, because all of our infinities eventually end."
3," A friend of mine read this book and it came highly recommended. As she described the story, she got emotional, and I happen to be a sap so I decided against reading it. I kept seeing the cover pop up on my kindle and eventually gave in.About the book: I will first say that it was really hard to follow in areas because I had no idea what some of the words/sentences meant. (Honesty is the best policy) And I think that while Hazel, Augustus, and Isaac lightened the mood with their cancer jokes, they also seemed to sort of miss life by trying to figure it out too thoroughly. This may possibly be the normal reaction given their situations. These are the only reasons that I gave four, instead of five stars.The emotion in this book is felt deep. And it caused me to try and understand what people (even children) go through in a battle against disease. Thankfully the author didn't dwell on impending death and reactions from family members about diagnosis and treatments. The primary focus in this book is about the fight, something so seemingly heroic, that truly is just a necessity for the patients."
5," Cried like a baby!! This was the fastest I've read a book, which was within 10 hours, I couldn't put it down. So sweet and can't wait to see the movie!!"
4, Much better that the movie.... so sad and if you don't cry you are heartless. Can't believe the ending because it is the last thing you would expect to happen
5, Seriously it's that good. It's such a beautiful read and I'm not ashamed to admit I cried for hours afterwards. But it was worth it to read this book. READ IT
5," So many plot twists. Funny, unexpected, amusing, I absolutely could not put this book down!I'd recommend this to anyone who loves a more... feelsy book."
2," John Green, you have done it again! As a chronically ill teen myself let me tell you that everything is spot-on! This is my, An Imperial Affliction. Loved it!"
5, do not typically read popular fiction or summer reads. But I am so happy I read this book. Read it and share it with your teenaged kids.
5, John you brilliant jerk! You make your readers care for these people only to tug at our hearts. I salute you for it. Only the most amazing people can do that.
5," Heartbreaking and beautiful all at the same time. Young kids dealing with serious issues, but in such a beautiful and mature way. Can't wait to see the movie."
5, great story. good character development. plot twists. really likable characters. emotional roller coaster which was expected but not in the way that it ended.
5," really like John Green, but he is an excellent writer for young adults especially dealing with topics that most adults do not want to broach with teenagers."
5, While this book was awesome......I still have to say this....WHY AUGUSTUS?????  I myself just read. This book over since it was that amazing but still...WHY?!
5," What a beautiful story about illness, life, support, family and love. You will smile and cry while reading this book. It makes everyday problems seem trivial."
5," Moving, funny, sharply written. Perfectly captured both the teenage and adult perspectives. I hope John Green has a long career if this is how well he writes."
5, got this book last night.I finished it this morning. One of the best books I have ever read. I can only hope nothing bad ever comes to Hazel and her family.
2, This book is so well-written and moving. I cried a countless number of times and I cannot stress how one's outlook on life will change after reading this book
5, loved this book. I recommended it to our book club at school. It is the kind of story that moves your soul as well as your belly! I laughed and cried often.
5, had no idea what the book was about and just started reading it. Very well written and melted you pulled in to the end!!! I recommend this book to everyone.
5," This book was absolutely beautiful and gave such a realistic image of the battle of cancer and how it alters  a person's life from their declining health to the very relationships they have built or tried to build. John Greene did a wonderful job and I must say that I am very excited to see the motion picture. Yes, the book was captivating and drew me in as a reader. So...why four stars, you ask? The storyline was excellent and was very creative but as drawn in as I was at times the long, scattered monologues with a plethora of philosophical thinking and analyzing was a bit too much for me. The characters were very eccentric which served as both a pro and con. For me the only, con was that sometimes it went off-topic or was very hard to follow. Pro: I loved the things that they though about because like myself I enjoy thinking in New and innovative ways. Also, their love was true. Not the typical cliche romances often depicted in today's media. Their love was refreshing and it was nice to see them grow together and what they meant to one another. I definitely recommend this book. I hope my review helped :) enjoy."
5," When one of my friends recommended I read The Fault in Our Stars, I looked it up and wondered why he was recommending it to a college age male. But it was a friend who I trusted so I decided to give it a try.  I took out a hold on the book from my library's ebook collection, (I was number 8000 on the list) and after 3 months I finally got my chance to check the book out.  I was blown away. The story is well written and absorbing, even for someone who is not necessarily in the target audience.  Along with the the story, The author also manages to dose us with a number of life lessons which can be appreciated by everyone young or old, healthy or, god forbid, unwell. The story left me with many ideas to ponder and I wholeheartedly recommend it to everyone (though some elements, like the constant underlying discussion of death, as well as some of the aspects of the romance, could make it unsuitable for children and some younger teens). There were also some elements of the ending that I intuited as the story went on (I'm trying to avoid spoilers), but this, as is often the case, may have been intended by the author."
4," This is my first book review. With that you might imagine I don't read a lot... But I happen to be one of the most avid readers my friends and family know of.I am 18, from Brazil. This book, for a teenager, is a perfect insight in what cancer is and what it causes to people diagnosed with it... It shows in full detail how LIFE is, and shows, too, that the cancer patients feel like a side effect... I have a grandfather that has been diagnosed with cancer and survived. It is a constant struggle and worrying that it might come back, and what to do after... But even though having someone I love so much with the disease, I never saw cancer as I saw with this book.It just blew me away.I will buy it for him and the rest of my family. I will write on the cover that they are not scars to me, they are marks. That I love them. That they meant too much for me even to describe. I will thank their existence and say that even though they haven't changed the world, they changed me. They changed me and I will die with that in my mind. After all, that is what seems to be relevantNever give up."
5," This book has been probably the best book that i have read in a long time. I usually do not enjoy reading most books because of the slow pace and not a lot of action. But i really actually enjoyed this book. This book is about a 16 year old girl named Hazel Lancaster, who is living with terminal thyroid cancer, which caused her lungs to be weak and need an oxygen tank, who also narrates the story as you progress through. Early on the story, it is at a support meeting that she meets a boy named Augustus Waters, who lost his leg to a tumor on his leg. And he soon becomes a person that Hazel wants to be around, and enjoys hanging out with. And for the rest of the story, it is very interesting to hear their stories as the book progresses. The characters were so realistic, that about half way through the book, i forgot that the characters were fictional, and i actually felt for the characters. But even though the story was very good, and i enjoyed it for the most part, there was a couple parts of the story where i thought it was a little slow, and that it was a slow pace. But overall, i thought it was a great book."
5," picked up this book due to the impending movie. I knew nothing about what it was about, other than it's recent young adult fiction and they made a movie based on it. Much like City of Bones and Twilight, I expected to utterly despise it and use it as more fodder for my lamentations on the horribly written dreck that is published and foisted off on unsuspecting young adults these days.I could not have been more wrong. This may be one of my top ten favorite books of all time. It's beyond beautifully written. Yes, it's still a young adult love story, but it is so, so much more than that. It has laugh-out-loud funny dialogue somehow perfectly interwoven into chapters so heartbreaking I was tearing up too much to continue reading. It's never cliche or unrealistic. In fact, it's staggering in its realism.This deserves every bit of the accolades it's received so far—I'm now worried the movie will never be able to do it justice. I hope it pleasantly surprises me, as well.Please, please read this book! We need more young adult fiction—or any type of fiction—written of this caliber."
4," Warning: get your tissues ready. I knew this book was going to be emotional, but I wasn't fully prepared.Hazel Grace is a 16 year old, only child, who has been diagnosed with cancer. She has essentially been given a death sentence.  Her doting parents have made it their life mission to provide the best life they can with what time she has left. Hazel starts attending a support group for kids with cancer and meets an unlikely friend. Hazel tries to make herself emotionally unavailable, but can't help but be charmed by Augustus Waters.I hesitated to read this book because I am prone to tears...commercials can make me cry!  I went against my initial thoughts and picked it up anyway, and then couldn't put it down. John Green did an amazing job at capturing the feelings of these two teenagers as well as the friends and family involved. After I finished the book, I felt lost. Not because of the writing or the storyline itself, but because I wanted more. I felt so involved with the characters that I didn't want to stop.Pick up the book, but make sure you pick up some tissues first!"
5," After reading many customer reviews on this book, I downloaded a sample to my Kindle and I couldn't wait to buy it. It got me from the very first pages.I find it hard to believe that this amazing book is so cheap. It's so well written, the characters felt very real to me. And it also left me thinking about what these kids go through every day, what anyone with cancer has to face each day. You can try to imagine, but I guess you never really get it unless you're the ill one.The first half of the book is really adorable, as the relationship between Hazel and Augustus grows. I loved the macho/dude/whatever friendship between Isaac and Augustus. Of course as the story goes on I couldn't stop crying but it's a fascinating book. Why fascinating? Because I think the author managed to cover each and every emotion everyone involved in this situation (patient, family, friends) goes through, and makes you feel them as well.I laughed, got angry and cried. I really recommend this book. It's a lesson about living life as best as we can and being true to ourselves in what we do with the time we are given."
2," Although with over 16,000 people basically saying the same thing, I'm not sure another review is necessary; however, I still felt compelled to add my applause for The Fault in Our Stars. As cancer has touched my family several times, I was hesitant to read this book fearing it would be too depressing. However, as the accolades mounted, I eventually broke down and purchased it, deciding I could always stop reading if it became too much. I literally could not put the book down and finished it in two days then immediately went back to Chapter 1 and started again - something I do not ever recall doing. Although there are some very touching moments, and parts did make me cry, I also laughed and rejoiced in the gift that life is and the many simple pleasures that we overlook. The book defines honest emotion and even though some of the humor has been labeled as dark, and it probably is, I think that it also illustrates that when life is at its toughest, you need humor the most....and sometimes dark days require dark humor.If you've been thinking about reading this book....do it. You won't regret it."
5," Easy read it took me about 3 days. It met all the requirements it made me care, get to know the characters, and really feel their pain. Definitely recommend."
5," A typical sappy novel with sweet thought provoking characters.  An Un twist.  A novel with such acclaim, and so predictable.  Tears do not make a novel great"
5, And surprisingly the movie adaptation was almost as good.Definitely worth the time and tears lol.Go and see the movie and DONATE TO ST. JUDES :-)
3," This is a beautifully tragic story! It's rendered me speechless, blown away, smiling, amazed and crying!John Green has me in love with this book!"
5,"m not a big reader at all, but when I picked this book up I didn't want to set it down. Also I've never been so excited to see a movie. Highly recommended."
5, Turning this book I fell in love with the characters but I also cried it is sad especial y because  I just lost someone to cancer. But awesome book must read
5," This is a young adult novel, and I started reading it before my 13 yr old read it.  But it drew me in, and it was wonderful!  Dark, deep, sad, but wonderful!"
5, The teenage/world issues melt your heart in some ways... I love how they react to their illness and how they make the readers fall in love again and again...
5, This was a great read. I really did not want to read something this sad but you end feeling so a part of these teenagers lives it is a remarkable experience.
2, had to do my 1st ever cook review Must readSo well writtenSo realSo movingI can relate because so far I have had cancer twice
5," Amazing is inadequate to describe this novel.  I was in love with the characters and sobbed at my losses.  For the losses were mine, the investment too deep."
5," am a fan of John Green. I was difficult picking up this novel to read, but I finally did it. After watching vlog brothers, you can see John I in this book."
5," REALLY LOVE THIS BOOK, FROM START TO FINISH..IT WAS GOOD, AS FOR HAZEL AND AGUSTUS, STAR-CROSSED LOVE....IT WAS FUNNY, SAD AND WELL A LITTLE HEART CRUSHING"
5, All I know is she picked the book herself and was very excited to get it for her birthday. she said it was a very interesting book and can't wait to read it.
5, There are no words to describe how amazing this book is. This is not your typical love story. I laughed and cried and felt ALL  the emotions. Thank you John.
5," haven't cried for words in a really long time. This book makes me cry for almost five minutes. I read the last two pages twice, and nothing to do just cry."
5, enjoyed every second of this book &amp; am truly sad that it's over.. I hate when a good book ends and this book definitely exceeds the title not a good book!!
5," thought I would not like this book because as a mother, having a child who is ill must be terrible. It was so beautifully written. I could not put it down."
5, This is an amazing book that I really loved. I liked the romance and the whole idea of everything. I think the plot was great and I couldn't stop reading it.
2, ...and I miss these two....Gus + Hazel.  Yes this book is about kids with cancer which is why I didn't rush to read it but it was non -cloying and beautiful.
5, This book was everything I wanted and more. I takes you on a roller coaster of ups and downs. It really changed the way I think about some things. I love it!
5," When I got to the end of “The Fault in Our Stars” by John Green, I thought, “Whoa…this can’t be the end. My Kindle version must have malfunctioned.” But after I thought about it, I decided there can be no better ending.Beautifully written, this book has captured the young adult fiction world but transcends into the adult. It appears on list after list after list of bests and must-reads…both YA and adult.I won’t soon forget Hazel and Gus and Isaac and Van Houten and Lidewij Bliegenthart and all they went through together. Enough said. Just read the book!In theatres earlier this month, the film is getting rave reviews. Perhaps I’ll see it with my sister-in-law Cathy. I’m usually disappointed in films of books I love, but perhaps this one will be different.Rottentomatoes.com says, “Wise, funny, and heartbreaking without resorting to exploitation, ‘The Fault In Our Stars’ does right by its bestselling source material.” Out of 155 critics rating the film, 81% give it a positive review. Audience members posting ratings at the site give it an average rating of 4.4/5."
5," The way the writer uses language to describe sensations, scenery, thoughts, etc. is amazing. The conversations between the characters or the way they act or think is very realistic and entertaining.It's a very different book from the normal YA ones, that in my opinion deserves to be read.I really liked the book, but that doesn't mean that I liked everything about it (that's why I am giving it 4 stars). In my opinion, Hazel, one of the main characters if not the main one, got to a point where she became too negative and found fault in everything everyone did or said in a way that was tiring, just because it wasn't how she thought or acted. Although I think its normal for a teenager but it bothered me a little, especially when she used sarcasm to disrespect her parents, with the excuse of being misunderstood.Another thing I didn't liked about the book was the fast pace it took from the end of chapter 13 to the beginning of chapter 21 (I don't want to give an spoilers). It felt like race to finish the book as soon as possible.Anyway, I hope I explained myself the best I could, I tried."
5," Easily the best young adult novel I've read in my life. It has all the casualness and the wit a young adult novel should have, but doesn't dumb the world or the language down like most of them do. It gives you something beautiful, rich, eloquent, full of metaphors and developed, rich, lovable characters. It builds your heart up, stomps I t to mush, then builds it back up anew. It left me just loving life. If you want, you can read my original review below, which I blurted out in the semi hysterics of having just finished the book:I don't know. What you want me to say? It was amazing. Right now I'm just sort of bobbing in the wake of its awesomeness like whoa! The prose was beautiful. Eloquent. Made me use the Kindle dictionary a lot and I loved it! The dialogue was witty, the narration style was so wonderfully colorful and the narrator was so casual-sassy-smart-teenish. The characters were developed into beautiful, beautiful people who I just loved reading about. The metaphors...ohh the metaphors! I'm still trying to decrypt some of them! What are you doing still reading this?? Go buy it! NOW!!"
4," knew reading this book was going to be ugly, ugly as in REALLY ugly.No, no, not the story or the writing, those were beautiful. Beyond beautiful really, they were gorgeous.No, the ugliness came all from me. Ugly as in, now my eyes are red and swollen and my face is a mess and I may have gone through a whole box of tissues and yet still managed to chock out a laugh every now and then ugly.Gosh I loved this story, because after all, as the story goes, pain, is meant to be felt.What does one say about a masterpiece?I loved Augustus, I loved Hazel and I would like to believe that I am a better person because of them. Because I was able to read their story, to share in their love for one another.I still can't really express all I felt while reading this story or all the I feel now that it is over other than to tell you, it was a beautiful one to behold. An emotional one and one I do not regret reading, not for a minute, ugly tears or not. Swollen eyes or not.Thank you John Green for writing something so poignant and wonderful."
5,"t was absolutely very beautifully written. But I didn't like it for several reasons. Reason one was the age of the kids. Had they been nineteen or twenty I could buy the uber intelligent thought processes and vocabulary, (plus the sex involved in falling in love, they are sixteen and seventeen) Reason two, the three main characters all were given basically the same smart funny voice by the author which wasn't realistic.But probably for me the main reason was not understanding why at least One of the kids could not be a winner in the battle against stupid cancer. My niece has cancer and there Are winners, there Are cures. There should have been one of the main characters in the support group who didn't get sick again, who wasn't bound to die or be blind eventually. One who wasn't let down by every other person other than their parents. Just a very personal reason for being negative. I am sure to get backlash because most people do love this book.I gave it two stars rather than one because the writing is as stated, very beautiful."
5," This book was very well written, I felt like it was a writer's read. I was recommended this book last summer and finally got around to reading it. I don't think I'll watch the movie, because the book was good enough just as a book. I love the voice, which I feel never quite translates into a movie, and I love Hazel's attitude towards the world and her situation. It's sad, of course, but you expect that going into it. I love the literary and art references (The Treachery of Images - actually on Jeopardy last week!), the title taken from Shakespeare, and the way that the book follows a 'in a cancer story, this is where this happens...but here is what happens for us' sort of story line. It is not too complicated of a story, and maybe not my favorite story ever in the sense of plot, but the emotions feel real and I really felt for the characters in this book. Lately I've been comparing everything YA that I read to John Green and nothing has quite lived up to this one yet! Definitely recommend this book!!! Overall, if you're looking for a YA book that's also a great piece of writing, this one can't be missed."
2," really loved this book. I was suppose to be reading this book for English Honors instead, The Bluest Eye. It's funny cause that was mentioned in the book. I also read Julius Caesar last month so I was pleasantly surprised when I found out Cassius' line about Destiny was a big influence in this book. I'm not the type to enjoy love stories, but I instantly fell in love with Augustus Waters and his relationship with Hazel. The world would be a Utopia of happy women if every man was an Augustus Waters. I cried, no, sobbed all last night reading this book. The only flaw to this book is that Augustus and Hazel didn't spend enough time together. They feel in love too quickly and I feel there wasn't enough of that love because the book ended so quickly. I wish it was longer. I also wish there had been a scene with them looking at the constellations while (SPOILER ALERT) Gus was dying. Either way I still loved it. If you like to read tragedies, or you just like to read depressing writings like I, then this is highly recommended. Also to those who love romances but not sappy ones. The writing is also amazing."
5, bought this because I wanted a good ol' sappy book to read over the summer... don't know why everyone is obsessed with this book because it was pure crap.
2, This book was beautiful and the story was pulling on all your heart strings. I simply loved it. It's a must readThe author is a beautiful writer
1," The story held my interest, gave me some things to think about that I haven't spent much time thinking about yet.Entertaining, yet kind of depressing."
5, New to the author.  Several friends recommended the book and I will never see a movie without reading the book first.  Hope the movie does the book justice.
4," This book was excellent. There are so many words to describe this book. Amazing, inspiring, adorable, clever, heartbreaking, and so many more. Wow, just wow"
5," Was the first time I'd heard my story, falling in love during cancer treatment. Beautifully written, sensitive, touching, redeeming, true. A gift of a book."
5," This book is incredibly amazing, although heartbreaking. I would honestly recommend it to anyone. The characters are relatable, but unique at the same time."
5, loved this book sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much!! I cried my eyes out! It was the best book I have ever read!!
5," laughed, I cried, it became a part of me.  I loved these characters... their dialogue and interactions just drew me in so much.  I just loved it.  Period."
5," This book made me smile and cry and imagine my life and future with my boyfriend that I never have thought and imaged before. Truly inspiring, this book is."
5," cried,I laughed, I got mad all at the same time while reading g this book. I love the way this book could make me smile no matter what was going on. Bravo"
2, just loved the book and got through it in two days. It is especially great for anyone who has ever lost anyone to cancer and likes a well written romance.
5," This is one of the few books that deserves all the hype it gets. If you're debating whether to read it or not...then debate no further, this is a must-read."
5, Book was both witty and romantic. Everything a girl wants in a book. You will fall more in love with the story as you read on. Definitely recommend reading!
5, compelling story with fabulous strong characters and some good twists and turns.. .  stuck with me for a long time after I finished it!  highly recommend!!!
5, Beautiful. John Green is a genius and I will definitely be reading more of his books.Some infinities are bigger than other infinities.
5,"ve read other books by John Green and have loved them as much as I loved this book.  It was a great read, engaging, and I had a hard time putting it down."
5,"f you're looking for a quick read, this is a good book for you. Witty, humorous, love story (not sappy Twilight love), sadness, and demanding to be felt."
5," This book will change your life. Garunteed. It's interesting, funny, and touching. I enjoyed it very much and recommend it. There are some mature parts tho."
5, This was an excellent read. Even under life's worst circumstances true love still can prevail. This is both happy and sad but true to life. Very quick read.
5, This was an amazing read! Cried years of joy and sadness. Couldn't put this book down! The love and acceptance between the characters was written perfectly.
2,"f you've read that this is a Young Adult book and have hesitated to read it on that basis, resist that reluctance and get this book now. It is one of those novels that may have been slotted for the YA market, or perceived that way initially, but that is wonderful for readers of all ages who love quality fiction.This novel is wry, witty, poignant of course (but not in a sappy way) and is one that stuck with me for some time after putting it down. Oh, and I wouldn't read too many reviews about it. I went in totally cold--having seen only the book on someone's desk and receiving the admonition to read it--and was glad for that. I went home the same day, bought it on the kindle and read it in two big gulps, but had I started earlier could easily have read it in one sitting which might have been even better. A couple of plot elements strain credulity and are therefore briefly distracting (hence the 4 and not 5 stars), but luckily these are few.Anyway: get The Fault in Our Stars, and read it. It is easily one of the best books I've read in years and might be for you, too."
5," Luh-uh-uhve this story, these characters. Hazel is so refreshingly real. She's me, she's my best friend; she's so genuinely normal, except for the fact that she is seventeen and has cancer. (Which is quickly becoming more and more 'normal' in our world.)John Green, you are a master. I'm a 30 year old, married mom of one, yet you so beautifully crafted this story that I gladly, easily, quickly (on page one), handed over my heart for you to shred into tiny pieces. And the truth is, I would do it again without a thought.I ached with you, Hazel Grace. And when you said, I do.. on that last page, I ached with you all over again. I'm doing it now, typing this review.Of course, I think the book is far superior to the movie. And I loved the movie. Cried like a baby, wanted to walk down the hall and wake my baby just to hold him tight. This is more than a simple book. That's the thing about pain, it demands to be felt. And you WILL feel it. This story forces you to count your blessings, and reach out in compassion to those around you who are suffering."
4," enjoyed reading The Fault in Our Stars by John Green. I found it believable and I liked everything about the story, except for the language used by the young adults the book is about. As other reviewers have pointed out, young adults just don't talk like that; and neither do the great bulk of older people.That one problem I had with the book is really a minor one, however, as all the characters were well developed by Mr. Green and I did like Hazel Grace, Augustus and Isaac, the protagonists of the story. It was, I think, a difficult story to tell, about young people, cancer, love and dying. And I think the author did an excellent job of it with caring and humor, sprinkled with a little bit of angst and real anger. There's also a story within the story: the book written by Mr. Van Houten, and it's ending, that Hazel and Augustus ponder over. And what affect the book, and the author, have on them both.There are so many reviews I won't go into the story itself, as it's been told, but I will say it caused some interesting emotion to well up. But then, I've always been a sucker for schmaltz."
5," had heard a lot about this book, and after a few of my friends in our close-knit group read it, I decided to enlighten myself with it as well.When I started the book, I was afraid my high expectations and the popularity of the novel would lead to me disliking it. I have never been more wrong. The characters, the plot, the writing style, everything about it was perfect.I will start with my opinion on the characters. I fell in love with each of the character immediately. My favorite thing about them was that they were not perfect. They each had they're own flaws and made mistakes, and I connected with them. I understood them. I loved Hazel's sense of humor and the way Gus was so positive and strong.The plot was fresh and unlike anything else I've read. It was wonderful. It made me smile and laugh one moment, and then I'd be brought to tears the next. It was definitely an emotional ride.Overall, I highly recommend this book. I feel everyone should experience this novel in order to survive. Once you read it, you'll wonder how you lived without knowing of Gus and Hazel's story."
4," Two days ago I finished The Fault In Our Stars by John Green.Wow, what a brilliant book!Amazon has over 11,000 reviews on their site for this book.  So what can I possibly say that hasn't been said?  Probably nothing.  But that doesn't stop me from wanting to celebrate another glorious book, one that kidnapped my heart for a while.It's a story about two kids with cancer that fall in love.  It's eye-opening and great and painful.  I think I'm allergic to the materials in the book, however, because my eyes watered up a few times.  Which is really weird because I read it on a Kindle.Kids living with terminal illness is a subject I can't pretend to fully comprehend.  I am not sure that real-life victims can either; not everyone can be Plato or Socrates and contemplate and understand life perfectly.  However, I imagine this book gives us a good idea of what those kids think about--the jokes they make to cover up the pain--or the surprising depth of understanding, even at such a young age.  The realism is breathtaking.John Green ... wow.  Well done."
5," John Green's The Fault in Our Stars blew me away. A friend of mine was reading the novel, and I easily pushed away her recommendation. I scoff at the idea of young adult fiction and steer clear of these novels -- they're below me. But something attracted me to the premise: two teenagers with cancer, dealing with existential questions. It's not traditionally a youthful conversation.I decided to read the first chapter and was hooked by the prescient and accurate portrayal for those affected by cancer and other illnesses. Green has a masterful ability to convey the disgust by sufferers -- for those who try to overly sympathize. He captures the essence of the disease of cancer and terrible reality that awaits. All the while, he beautifully honors the struggle of his characters -- it's a gift.I won't ruin the plot or book, but I must give one warning. I'm not a crier usually; if anything, I'll leak a tear at a good book. The Fault in Our Stars led to true crying for the last quarter of the book. It touched me deeply. Five stars, without any doubt."
5," This book did things to me. It is such a sweet story about love and loss. Dealing with the lot that life has given you and being bold in the face of every obstacle that is thrown your way. There were moments that made me burst out in laughter and others that had me hugging the pillow and crying.The book follows the life of Hazel who is living with cancer. Her mom is making her live by going out to a support group. This is where she meets Augustus. Hazel &amp; Gus' love story is inspiring and heartbreaking all at the same time. Those two are wise beyond their years and suffer more than any teenager should.There is a fun cast of secondary characters as well. Isaac is their mutual friend from the support group. He plays a pretty significant role in both of their stories. And both Hazel &amp; Gus' parents play big rolls in the book. Then there is their author, who lets them down but ultimately teaches them a lesson as well.There are not enough words to describe how wonderful this book is and nothing I can say will give it the justice it deserves. Have your tissues ready."
5, Very touching; loved itEnjoyed everything about this story.Would not change anything about this book.Recommend it to everyone
5," Not as much of a tear jerker as everyone said.  Still a great read. This book makes you want to be a better person, to see things in a more positive light."
5," To me this book is about living your best life now and not letting anything stop you from living the way you want, even though sometimes it's sad and hard."
2," The book is really well written, and is my new favorite book! I would recommend this book to anyone as it is a story of love, strength and is just perfect."
5, absolutely loved this book!! Be prepared for love and tears because this book will put you on an emotional roller coaster. I highly recommend it!! &lt;3
5," Extremely well written and engaging. Extraordinary character development. Subject matter, of course, is tough and it's a sad story all in all.  Great read!"
5, Best book affair I've had in a long time! It was a privilege getting my heart broken and mended by these characters! All I can say is Thank You John Green!
5," laughed out loud, I was annoyed an  I cried. This book did what is was was suppose  to, I fell in love with the characters and sad it's over. Perfection."
5, this is such a touching book. I read the end multiple times. I also let my friend read it and she was on the verge of tears. :) great job again john green!
5, don't like many books. But I would read this book a million times over.I would recommend by anyone who sees the world in a different view than most
5," love, love, love, love, this book!!!! It was intriguing from the very beginning. Honestly, I've read about ten times since I got it. It's a must read!!!!"
5," John Green strikes again with the feels.This is by far one of my favorite books. It's a young adult/teen book, but people of all ages will enjoy this book."
5, What a wonderful author! The very fine character definition and emotional sensitivity is a pleasure to read. Added to this are the wonderful life insights.
2, Amazing story.  One of the best I've read in years.  It's sold as a young adult novel but all adults will tear through this book.  My husband loved it too!
5,"t was everything I had hoped it would be. In the words of Oswin Oswald, It was too beautiful to live.I recommend this book strongly!"
5, would recommend this to readers of all ages. The 14 year old girl that I babysit and I read it at the same time and loved it. We both finished in 3 days.
5, Great book loved every page.  I could relate to every character. From the very beginning I knew the endings was going to be sad but I couldn't put it down.
5, One of the most beautiful books I have ever read. It will break your heart ans leave you wanted more. My all time favorite love story. Beautifully written.
5," Anyone who has fallen in love, anyone who was a teenager, anyone who knows or knew someone who is/was terminally ill would get something out of this story."
5," Absolutely amazing!  A book about love, living, and dying, not really a cancer book.  A tear- jerker and a sweet novel with a little bit of sass."
5," laughed and cried. So amazing. I read it in 6 hours. It is phenomenal. John Green is an artist. Wonderful quotes, wonderful tragedy, and wonderful ideas."
5," Such a good read. Their definition of cancer patients really made me think. I even highlighted parts to remember later, something I don't do since college."
5,f only I had more time...I would definately read any and everything written by this author. so interesting/immediately sucks you in. goes quickly as well.
2," This is one of my favorite books that I have read recently, and I go to book camp (I'm that nerdy). To misquote John, it made me feel MOST OF THE THINGS!"
5," This book is not a 'feel good, cosy up next to the fire' kind of book, it is real. And it has been a while since I read something real. I wish I could say that I cried while reading this book, but sadly I didn't. I really wanted to cry, to cry at the sad moments, and the moments when you think to yourself, wow, that it what strength is.... I enjoyed this book, it was in a way, a wake up call to remind me, oh yeah, there isn't always a happy ever after. I would not recommend this book to anyone under middle school age, because these kids are going through cancer, and some parts could be pretty hard to read, and if you try to skip those parts you will be disappointed, because the worst of them had caught me off guard. I would recommend this book to anyone age appropriate though, something worth a shot at even if you may not be interested in the type of book. This book did wonders for me, it changed my perspective, (which is pretty hard to do) and I was rather impressed with these characters. I am glad I tried something new. I hope that if you do decide to try it you enjoy it as much a I did."
5,"ve seen a great many reviews knocking the dialogue for the fact that it is rather truthfully contrived and 99% of teens don't talk like this in any way, shape or form. That being said, I give you what passes as real, honest dialogue by today's teenagers:Hazel: I've accepted that I'm going to die, but that doesn't mean it won't suck.Augustus: Yeah, it's like you're trying to climb a bunch of stars but keep tripping on your way up (or whatever cheesy metaphor fits your fancy)We've all had feelings that we weren't able to express, feelings that we don't have the words to describe. Green took two intensely feeling teenagers and gave them the words necessary to explain the utter hopelessness and gloom that takes hold of terminally ill patients. If the dialogue were real and honest, the message would have been lost.I loved this book, and I respect just about any viewpoint to the contrary, but the dialogue is perfect in that the message is allowed to be told and not suffer from the lack of words those of us who aren't professional authors inherently have."
4,"f you've never read this book before, here's a quick review.~spoilers~There are 313 pages, You don't meet Augustus waters till page 8, he doesn't speak till page 11. He leaves us on page 263. That is 253 pages from when we meet him to when he leaves. And in those 253 pages he's Physically in 176 of them. And  that's all it took. We slowly, then all at once, fell in love with Gus just as Hazel did. His love for metaphors, his fear of oblivion, his goofy smile, prosthetic leg, everything. And when he leaves, there's this hole in your heart. You feel Hazel's pain and you cry with her, and sympathize with her, and at the end, you'll cry, and smile, feeling empty but satisfied. And you'll never be the same again.This book is truly amazing, if you have not read it I strongly suggest you do. I've read it more than once, and every time I read it, I fall in love all over again. John Green, I hope you write more books in the future. you can count on me to buy it. you are a truly amazing writer and you've changed my life, your book helped me get through hard times. Thank you."
4," Unfortunately I am one of those people that didn't have the pleasure of reading this novel before the movie came out, but this doesn't mean that I enjoyed it any less. I honestly thought that Hazel and Gus were far too advanced thinkers for teenagers, and quite frankly, I felt inferior while reading because I am the same age as them! However, this did not lessen my enjoyment and simultaneous pain while reading. I knew it was going to be sad, but I didn't know it would cause sobbing into my pillow sadness. Like seriously John? Freaking cancer to the most amazing couple? I honestly didn't like Hazel much until she met Gus. He awakened something in her that had been dead since 'PreMiracle'. He taught her (and me as a reader) how to enjoy the simple pleasures of live while we are able to. I just can't take this. I feel so bad for them. I'm still crying, and the worst part of it all is that Hazel is inspired by a real girl who died from cancer. Thank you John Green, for crushing me while at the same time making me laugh, smile, cry, and learn how to live the best life today."
5," This book is literally an eye opening, life changing, sad, romantic, and funny view into the mind of a teenager or just a kid with cancer. The way that it shows how people with cancer probably feel is perfect. It gives you an insight in to a teenagers life as well. This book follows Hazel's adventure with a boy also diagnosed with very heartbreaking cancer and their arguments, their jokes, their love. Most books you read today, they always have a happy ending...but that's not how the universe works. Green, in his book, displays reality. Some people are healthy, some people are sick, some people fight, some people give up, some people die, some people live and have to move on...no matter how hard that is. When some one dies, you're never going to be ready for it. Hazel's a perfect example of a person who just gets it, she knows how to leave this world and how to get over something, even when you really care about it.I honestly cried the whole last 5 chaptersThis book is really worth reading, it's worth your years, and it will definitely become one of your favorite books."
5," The Fault in Our Stars is an incredible book to say the least. It made me laugh and it made me cry, a lot. I wept and then wept some more. I didn't have any Kleenex tissue to wipe my tears, so I used my blanket. This story will touch your heart and pull of every string you have. I haven't seen the movie yet, but I hear it's great and does the book justice. That's actually saying a lot since most movies don't ever seem to be able to accomplish that comparitively speaking. I look forward to the opportunity to see the movie. Author Mr. John Green is extremely gifted in his writing capabilities to pull such raw vivid emotion out of his readers. When an author has accomplished that he/she has succeeded and has much to be proud of. I would love the chance to meet Mr. John Green one day and get his autograph and have a wonderful chat with him about how he came up with this touching tale. His talent and imagination knows no bounds. Many congratulations to John Green on his wildly successful book and movie. I highly recommend The Fault in Our Stars story, it will take you away... ~ Boni Michelle McCombs"
5," As someone who sees death on a fairly regular basis, I can say this story is beautiful. It gives me comfort and reminds me to appreciate the loves I have."
5, The Fault in Our Stars is a fantastic story. Green is able to tell a sad story with such humor. You really get involved in the characters' lives. READ IT!
5," Author used interesting language, kept me quite entertained and engaged.  I would recommend this book.  It is one of the best books I've in the last year."
2, enjoyed this book from the first chapter. At times I found myself laughing out loud and at other times I was tearing up. Enjoyable and witty throughout.
5, The best book I've ever read. The twists and turns are to die for. You will laugh. You will cry. You will be amazed by the love they have for one another.
4, love the honesty of the characters rejecting heroic stereotypes and embracing normalcy. I love their candid love. And I love how Augustus Waters speaks.
5, Best book ever.I loved this book. It always kept me wondering what would happen next. I rank this one next to the perks of being a wallflower.
5,t's a wonderful book about a teenager fighting cancer.I recommend this lecture to people of all ages. One of the best books I've ever read.. Enjoy!
5," This book had it all: humor,grief,and love.  Very well written. This book was a quick read because I could not out it down even when reading through tears"
5,t had me in tears several times. I think I finished the book in less than a day because of how well John kept me wanting to read more. Outstanding novel.
5, The Fault in Our Stars has been my favorite book since I read it when it was published. If you don't like it there must be something wrong with you. DFTBA
5, The fault in our stars is tremendously bold and honest. One I will recommend to many different audiences. You can't get through without a good sob or two.
5," A beautifully thought out page turner that will leave you wanting more. John Green, captured these characters so well. I would highly recommend this book."
2, Absolutely beautifully written!  I laughed...and cried...couldn't put it down!  Many age levels would love this book.  Thoughtful and sweet.  A must read!
5," This book was simply amazing. So many feelings I acquired through reading it, it was as perfect as it could ever be. John Green is a one of a kind writer."
5," read The Fault In Our Stars in one day.I laughed, I cried, it was wonderful.Also, my book was signed!I definitely recommend this book!"
5," John Green, you beautiful specimen. Thank you for these tears in my eyes and the pain  in my heart- they remind me that I'm alive... or at least existing."
5," Well written and easy to read.  It will make you laugh out loud and at other times, cry like a baby.  I look forward to reading more of John Green's work."
5," When I read I like to escape real life. So when I saw that this book was about kids with cancer I wasn't sure it was a book for me. Cancer is a heavy subject and kids with cancer is even heavier. But after seeing all the glowing reviews, I decided to give it a try. Once I started I couldn't put it down.Being from a family that has been affected by cancer many times, I feel like the author was able to convey what it's like to watch as someone you battles for their life. I have watched many loved ones fight the fight but with this book I feel I was able to get a peek into what it was like for my loved ones as they fought.Don't get me wrong, this book was not dark and dreary, quite the opposite. I found myself smiling and laughing throughout the book and the relationship between Hazel and Gus was very heartwarming. I loved the dialogue between these two. I also loved the fact that they were very real. They didn't sugar coat the illness or what they go through living with it. This book touched me in a way no other has before. It will resonate with me for a long time."
5," This was my first John Green book, not only did I read it, I bought it on audible, and saw the movie as well.  I like books that make me feel what the characters are going through. John Green does that and more.  This a beautiful love story, it's a gut wrenching story about kids with cancer, and an angry author.  Augustus was a rock for Hazel, I'm not sure how many grown men could have been that much of a rock for their wife in that situation. Hazel  is defiantly a heroine, strong and wise beyond her years.I've recommend this book to people and they tell me a flat NO! Why would I want to read something so sad? Was this book sad? Did this book make me cry? Well, yes it did. The sweet light reads are great and from time to time I read those. They normally get rated a three from me. Why, you may ask?  They do not provoke any feeling in me.  This book will make you laugh too!  You will laugh out loud. It will make you sigh!  I say even if you do not like sad books, give this a chance, it could just change your life!  Give you another way to think about things, you have that control."
5," This is perhaps the most fascinating book I've read yet!!! I've had many recommendations from friends and that I wouldn't be disappointed and indeed I wasn't! This book  so much promise to it and I fantasize about being as good of a writer as John Green. The fact that he can make a love story about two kids with cancer and focus more on the love than the cancer is beyond me! I wanted to rip out Peter's throat when he denied a dying girl's wish -.- this story is as comical as it is inspiring!!! I never thought that I would be interested in love stories but this story opened up my eyes and caused me to have a different outlook on life in a way such that you don't have to leave a mark on the world or be the hero, but instead to just go throughout life with a positive outlook and touch as many people as you can. The fault we leave on the world are so often scars -John Green. Well done!!!!! A great book that is sure to touch readers hearts all over. You don't get to choose if you get hurt in this world but you do get a say in who hurts you. I like my choices. I hope she likes them too"
5," originally read this book through my school library. I then felt the need to reread it , so I took it out again. When I realized Amazon had The Fault in Our Stars for $5 on Kindle I couldn't pass it up. This was the second John Green book I'd read, and it is still my favorite. I recommend it for people who like to think about books long after they've finished reading them. I want to teach a course just on this book. It's a goldmine of great quotes and great characters.  John Green is of a breed of now-rare YA authors that can write about life and death without a dystopian, post-apocalyptic backdrop. If I hadn't known better, I would have thought TFIOS had actually been written by a teenager girl- and I mean this in the pest possible way. Every time I read it I am astounded by its accuracy, humor, and heart.  And, perhaps most remarkably, it features a father who cries easy. Better yet, this father is not weak because of his tears, but perhaps a stronger character for them. And you will be, too, once you have dried your eyes after reading The Fault in Our Stars."
5," was on an airplane and ran out of things to read, when I noticed that my teenage daughter had downloaded a preview of this book on my kindle. I read the preview then could not wait to get Internet access to buy the book. After this, I read it for the next week or so every night I got a chance.To attempt to describe this book is to vastly understate it. It's a story about kids with cancer, love, friendship, and cheesy sounding things like that, but it's so much more. It's a book of thoughts. You're inside the mind of the main character, a teenage girl named Hazel who miraculously survives a bout with cancer and who becomes part of a support group where she meets cute and charming Augustus Waters, also a cancer survivor. They become involved in an adventure that takes them to Amsterdam where they have an unfortunate encounter with a former author, now a disgraceful drunk.Over time, some very large changes happen to the characters. In the final analysis, this story proves that life, and indeed the universe, has much more in store than we can possibly realize."
2, This book is everything it's made out to be. John Green is an amazing writer that knows exactly what he's doing when he tries to make you feel the feels.
5, What words? Delightful. Heart wrenching. Funny. Real. First love so earnest. These teens are a joy to love and loose.Be sure to have Kleenex.
5,t was such a good book!It started off pretty slow in the beginning but still left me wanting to know more! Be ready and have your tissue with you!
5, This is one of the best books I've read this year.  The book really clarifies what is important in life.  It is written so you care about the characters.
5," This book was absolutely breathtaking. I can't even begin to explain how amazing this book was written; Both on an emotional level, and a literary level."
5, Beautiful story that brought smiles and broke my heart - all the while giving hope. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys an emotion filled journey.
5," My 12 year old loved this book, and absolutely could NOT put it down. It also inspired her to see how she could donate her time/money to cancer research."
5, thought It was a really good and moving book and john green is really powerful as usual. It made me laugh and cry which means it was a really good book
5, One of the best reads in a long while. I found myself in Augustus Waters. The connection was so great and just about everything about him was me as well.
5," have no other words to describe just simply wow. This book made me laugh, cry, yell, and sometimes made me d ok downright angry so thanks for the book."
2, John Green is one of the best authors of this generation. He never fails to bring great works for the shelves of adoring readers. I couldn't put it down!
5," The star lit journey of a love few find, rarely so young. Beautiful, intoxicating, consuming the reader in a metaphor for what was endured by characters."
5," This book has great ideas and is beautifully written. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to fall in love, cry, laugh, and think. It was amazing."
5," This book was great. John Green has quickly become one of my favorite authors. To anyone looking for books of his to read, I'd definitely recommend this."
5, This book is perfect in every way left me in tears. I could not put the book down and proceeded to finish it in one day. Thank you for writing this book.
5, could not put this book down.  It shows you should not underestimate the teenage mind and strengh.  I would recomment this book to young and old alike.
5," The perfect balance of tragic and beautiful, this story appeals to all of the emotions. Warning: may become attached to/fall in love with the characters."
5, Overall fantastic story and extremely well written. It made my heart happy to read. I highly recommend this book and will read more books by this author.
5,t brings a needed awareness to a few of the struggles facing the individuals and families with cancer by focusing on life and not of the disease itself.
5," After a string of mediocre books I was happy to stumble upon this book.  Poignant, mildly pensive, funny, and just an overall good story.  A smooth read."
2," Well, some of it I liked, but the main plot about the story that the kids had both read and got so caught up in to find out what happened to the characters????  That did not grab my attention.  I think this book is for older teens more than it is for adults.  If I were a high school teacher I might use it as class assignment.  I think it gives very clear insight into the lives of those that are dying from a disease like cancer.  Of course, the book also points out that we all die a little every day.  From the moment we are born, we begin to head toward our death.  That is true of every diving thing.  It is the process of living that we should one day die.  This is also a book that leads to the exercise of writing your own obituary.  Many teachers use this as an assignment as well.  It is a book that will make you think about your own life, the way you live it, and how you interact with others that are very sick.  While it won't be one of my all time favorites, I would even say that it is a book that might require rereading to get all the meat on the bones of this story and plot."
5," don't even know where to begin on this review. John Green is a phenomenal writer. Poetic almost. I'll have to come back to this after I've given it some more thought.Ok, so I have a good day to think about this book. I loved it. I laughed, I cried, laughed some more and then sobbed. The love that Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters share happens only once in a lifetime. It was lovely to see them falling in love. Their journey with each other and their diseases is something I will not soon forget.I am very pleased with how John ended the book. Sure it broke my heart, but that's what cancer does. It breaks your heart. I think having lost someone to cancer caused it to effect me even more. Writing this review has brought fresh tears as well.I put John up there with another favorite author of mine, Maggie Stiefvater. His writing, much like Maggie's, is almost musical. The words just flow off the page. I will definitely be adding his other books to my to read list.Thank you John! This book was lovely, heart wrenching and so worth my time."
4," This book was one of a few books that I read within 24 hours. Now given that the book is only 25 chapters long this is no feat in itself, but it's the fact that I kept reading the book that's important. There have been few books that have kept me captivated enough that I would keep reading it straight though (I can't even recall the select few right now...Dark Tower Series is one). The Characters of Hazel and Augustus were so extremely well crafted that they truly became real to me and I grieved for and with them. I won't give away much else about the book other than to say if you love books that make you laugh and want to cry within the same sentence then you MUST read this one. I also wanted to say that this book is now defiantly one of my top 5 books. (PS. For those who like to listen to music while they read. I listened to a playlist called Snowday on the music app Songza, avail on Android/iOS (Apple) platform. It's a great soundtrack for the book and if there was a way I could suggest a few songs from it to be included on the Fault in Our Stars movie soundtrack I would)"
5," Hazel Grace Lancaster is a smart, snarky young woman who disdains convention, yet loves binge-watching popular TV shows. She’s also permanently attached to an oxygen tank, thanks to the Stage IV thyroid cancer that spread to her lungs when she was 14. In most instances, she’d probably be dead by now, but a recently developed miracle-drug has managed to slow down the tumor-growth in her lungs, thus extending her life for a couple of years. Now just 16, she’s already out of school with her GED, and her social circle is limited to a handful of people, including her parents, a friend from junior high, and regulars from a tedious support group that her parents force her to attend. Fortunately for Hazel, though, the support group is where she meets Augustus Waters, a one-legged survivor of osteosarcoma who, like Hazel, refuses to let cancer define him. The two quickly become close friends, and—over time—something more. John Green’s novel is not only a great, tragicomic love story, but also a monumental salute to the spirit of the terminally ill teenager. Recommended for Ages 14-Up."
5,ts a great book.Im going to see the movie today.I loved it.The people are so real.Its crazy that someone in the world portrays this horrible illness.&lt;3
5," This book, I can't even tell you on how I feel about it. I was having trouble finding a book I love, but John Green had certainly has written that book."
5,t was amazing and I have never read a more beautiful book! The pages from Agustus were so sweet and I'm glad you included them and created more emotion
5, This was one of the best books I have ever read!! The emotion was incredibly great. I couldn't put it down. I really recommend this book it was amazing.
5," This book was a definite page Turner! I couldn't put it down and carried it every where with me. I cried,laughed,was mad and happy all at the same time."
5, chose this book because I heard someone say it was really great and they were right... I cried my little eyes out and it was definitely worth reading!
2, This is a fast and addicting read.  It triggers so many emotions from the reader and leaves you with an odd sense of being okay.  Highly recommend this.
5," Although it is very heartbreaking, this book is worth the pain. The Fault in Our Stars will keep your eyes glued to the pages with every addicting word."
5," Very good book, easy to read.  Having lost a child to cancer, I found this very true as to how they handle this crises.  Loved the book!  A tear jerker!"
5, Amazingly good book! Well written.With a topic that it is so sad it is wonderful to be able to laugh due to the authors funny intellectual writing
5, love love love this book! It is very real and doesn't sugarcoat anything. I won't give any spoilers but have some tissues handy during the whole book.
5, This book was an unexpected surprise. It is a touching tale of Loving and Dying through the eyes of 2 modern day heroes. John Green wrote a masterpiece!
5, started reading this book knowing very little about it -- but seeing it everywhere. I was not disappointed. It's one of my favorite books of the year.
5," John Green wouldn't be the first author to sensitively tackle the subject of a teen dying of cancer. Jenny Downham's, Before I Die comes to mind. But he would write the most provocative, and in my opinion, the best. Our narrator, Hazel meets Augustus in a cancer support group. her lungs have been ravaged by the disease and her constant companion is the oxygen tank she wheels along beside her. Augustus is a cancer survivor, and former basketball player who lost the lower half of one of legs to the disease. These are bright, inquisitive kids, full of the smart quippy dialogue that seemed to be muttered by actresses like Emma Stone, or to date myself Janeane Garofalo. Yet I think what makes the book so poignant is in this current culture of social media, and instant celebrity, faced with ones own mortality, the question is asked, How will I leave a mark, how will I be remembered? Did my life, however long or short, matter? Questions that ultimately go beyond these two young souls and cause you to ask yourself the same."
5," John Green and I have a love/hate relationship. I love him, but he breaks my heart.Focus.Okay so I'm just going to put it out there this book is one of my all time favorites and definitely my favorite stand-alone book.This book can have complex and wonderful themes if you can understand them but even if you can't it's still worth a read.This is a more mature read so brace yourself for that.Symptoms of reading this book:-I swear to God, this book better not end midsentence-crying. Lots of crying. Always crying.-Quoting this book for life.-Overwhelming need to see the movie once it comes out (June 2014)-Laughing-Did I mention crying?Overall, read this book.If you are male, read this book. Then call me if you are single.I'm on a rollercoaster that only goes up.~Fangirl's ReportPS you can get to know John Green and his amazing brother Hank by watching them on YouTube. Just search for vlogbrothers."
5," The Fault In Our Stars is a magnificent piece made by John green, in which by far is his most impressive book (in my perspective). “The Fault in Our Stars” is quite a story involving a serious matter of concern… Cancer. I am relatively proud of the way he interpreted cancer into more of a humorous way so the readers won’t be either bored or uncertain/awkward about cancer. In my interpretation of, “The Fault in Our Stars” was an exceedingly emotional book that left me in pieces when one of my favorite characters (You should all know) Augustus Waters dies at a very unwelcoming end. Hazel Grace was of course devastated as was I, when my favorite character had met his certain demise. I could not get it this out of my head  “ ‘I am sorry Gus Died’... he said ‘The whole thing. Eighty percent survival rate and he’s in the twenty percent?Bs. He was such a bright kid. It’s bs. I hate it. But it was sure a privilege to love him huh?’ (pg.278)”  that is a line that stuck with me, it made me wonder about an old saying it’s better to love, than to never have loved at all."
2," At its core, The Fault in Our Stars is a teen romance novel. That both lovers have cancer is a tragic plot wrinkle, albeit a significant one. Since I am not a huge fan of teen romance novels, my appreciation of this story was somewhat limited. If you do not share my literary predilections, there is a good chance you will love this book. John Green makes a significant contribution to romantic and disease-centric literature in his unflinching portrayal of cancer in all its brutal, mortifying inhumanity. We know from the outset that both Hazel and Augusus are fated to live relatively short lives, but the strongest section of the novel comes when Hazel finds Augustus slumped in his car with an infected intubation, too weak to turn his head so as not to vomit on himself. This sad infirmity, not the otherwise picture-perfect mutual first sight infatuation, remains the most powerful example of tragic love in the story. Though limited somewhat by its genre, The Fault in Our Stars is a worthwhile read for Green's clever prose and honest examination of love in the age of cancer."
5, love this book!! It is one of my favorites books. It was very emotional and romantic. The end was very sad I almost cried!! Very good I recommend it.
3, What a profoundly affecting book. I literally took my breath away. Richly drawn characters that are very Juneau-esque. I highly recommend it.
5," The story is truly well written. The whole book challenged me to a whole new meaning of life. I look at life differently now, and how I want to live it"
5, could not tell you about this book as I bought it for my child and she read it all. She is waiting for movie movie. I would recommend reading reviews
5," Beautiful simplicity, well developed characters you grow progressively attached to.  A heart warming must read for the up and coming rising generation."
4, Simply brilliant.  These characters are real by the end.treat yourself to a fantastic read.The young adult version of Me Before You by Jojo Moyes
5, My daughter had to read a book for summer assignment and this was a great pick. She loved the story that I had to read it as we'll. It was so touching.
5, Love the author. Love the book. Love the writing. Love Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters. Highly recommend. I will be reading this again most definitely.
5, What an amazing book! It really puts life into a different perspective. Young love that is forced to face a travesty that no one should have to endure.
2, This was a great book - I couldn't put it down.  It had me laughing and balling so it was a whirlwind of emotion to read!  I definitely recommend it :)
5, have never brought myself to read such a great book and I have never found such a book to make me cry. I utterly enjoyed each word written. So. Good.
5," This book  takes you through a roller coaster of emotions. Love, pain, happiness and the brutality of loss and sorrow. I absolutely enjoyed every page."
5, This book is absolutely amazing. The sub text in this boo  speaks louder than the text itself. Highly recommended if you like a love story with twists.
5, A poignant tale that draws the reader in on the first page and doesn't let you go. The layers of the story intertwined and are beautifully illustrated.
5," Though it was sad it was so beautifully romantic.  I wish I had an Augustus Waters in my life, minus the cancer part! I recommend it to everyone!"
5," This book engages all of your emotions.  Th authors voice is witty, and sarcastic, and humorous in a way that leaves a smile on your face.  I loved it!"
5, This book is spontaneous!! I loved loved loved it!! It will make you laugh your heart out &amp; cry your eyes out!! Excellent book! Definitely a must read!
5, Beautiful and tragic. Although not a very realistic portrayal of actual teenagers dealing with first love and death entertained. Still really liked it.
5," Love is precious in all forms.  This is a book I would actually read again.  The characters are so real, you get connected and attached to the quickly."
2," Absolutely beautiful book. Completely heart wrenching and gave me butterflies and tears all throughout. I could not put it down, finished  in two days."
5, Just simply amazing. I can't find the exact words to describe the greatness of it...it just pulls you in and doesn't let go even when the book is over.
5," Since The Fault in Our Stars was talked about so much as being a great book, I decided to read it. It is written in the point of a young teenager and John Green didn't fail to potray that perfectly through Hazel Grace. The overall plot is pleasant but a bit on the cliché side. Two young people are sick and they fall in love. The book is also a bit slow in the beginning. But it is very descriptive and really pulls you in when a depressing or joyous part comes. The ending was predictable but still just as heart wrenching and emotional. It wasn't as depressing as everyone has described it as, but it still hurt a little reading it. The quotes were my favorite part. They were PHENOMENAL. My thoughts are stars I cannot fathom into constellations. or The marks humans leave are too often scars. They were deep and truthful without making Hazel sound too much like a pessimist.The book is amazing overall, and relatable to teens today. I think John Green has written better books such as Looking for Alaska, but this was still a satisfying read."
5," Cancer is a very touchy subject and John Green did a great job by not dwelling too much on the drama aspect but more towards adding humor which is one of Green’s specialties. TFIOS is so touching and full of life. Although fiction, one can relate to the many characters as they show and teach you to not take life so seriously and that the grass is greener when you open your eyes to new things. This book is not easily forgotten and you’ll find yourself wanting to hug these characters by the end of the book.The Fault in our Stars shows readers that there is light in every situation. Everyone you meet in life is either a blessing or a lesson and in Hazel Grace and Augustus’ case, it is very true. I’ve never cried so much reading a book before. While you are someone with cancer or know someone who has had or is battling, you can relate so much to the characters in The Fault. Everything about this book is so believable and so bittersweet. TFIOS passed harry potter, the twilight saga and the vampire diaries as my favorite book. I highly recommend it to all ages."
4," This is the beautiful, touching story of 16 year old Hazel Lancaster, who is dying from lung cancer.  Hazel meets the stunningly gorgeous cancer survivor Augustus Waters at Cancer Kid Support Group.  The two of them bond over their struggles and a book that they both love.Hazel does not want to get in a relationship with Augustus, though.  She knows that any day could be her last, and doesn't want to hurt Augustus by her dying.This book is written in first person from Hazel's point of view.  She is kind, insightful, and wise  beyond her years.The Fault in Our Stars will make you smile and laugh out loud.  You will fall in love, and you will cry in pain.  DO NOT MISS THIS NOVEL!Note: Do not be deterred from reading this book if you didn't like Looking For Alaska or Paper Towns by John Green.  I didn't like either of them, but I loved An Abundance of Katherines and The Fault in Our Stars.I have never cried so much while reading a book as when I read this one.  So, once you get to about 60% through, you do not want to read this in public."
5,"m a 64-year-old grandmother, and I enjoyed this book even though it seemed implausible at times that these characters would have achieved this level of maturity at their tender ages of 16 or so. Not having any personal experience with the subject matter -- teens dealing with terminal cancer -- I can only assume that perhaps that alone could account for an accelerated level of maturity? In any event, the story was entertaining enough to keep me reading. Hazel, the voice of the story, meets Augustus at a support group for cancer patients. She is immediately taken with him, and he with her. A relationship develops centered around Hazel's desire to get the rest of the story out of an obscure author whose book she has read multiple times, and Augustus throws himself into fulfilling her wish. Just when you think you've figured out how this book will end, you're thrown a curve ball which keeps things interesting. I do agree with some reviewers' opinions that these are not typical teenagers. But then why would they be considering what they are dealing with?"
5," actually really liked this book. The reason I read it in the first place was for my English I Honors Class. I am actually happy my teacher had us read this book because I now have a new way to look on thing especially the meaning of forever. I love this whole book but honestly the only thing I did not like much but yet in way I liked it because it took me by surprise was, the thing that happened to Augustus. The author has all his readers believing one thing will happen, yet the very opposite occurred, that's the part I very much liked. I would recommend that teenage kids that tend to take their precious life for granted, or those who have cancer that choose not to do anything in life, just because they have cancer. The reason why is because this book provides more than enough things, statements, reasons, or examples on going out to do something and just have an adventure and fun. If that makes since. Anyways really good I recommend this for anyone especially for those I stated earlier. I am looking forward to reading a few more books by John Green."
4, absolutely adore this book. It's full of never ending surprises &amp; the author makes me feel like I was watching these two amazing teens fall in love.
4," This book is very inspiring and thought-provoking. There are many, many quotes in this book that have just taken my breath away. Definitely memorable."
5, can't with this book. U love it so so so much I read it 5 times over and over and still crude my eyes out even though I knew it was coming
2, absolutely fell in love with this book! I've never been so interested in one like I was with this book. Everyone should read this. It'd magnificent!
5, haven't totally read the book yet...but i think I got a great deal on this book....i hope i get to finish reading this book before the movie comes out
5," A beautiful story. It sounds cheesy and corny, but it has messages in different levels. Have tissues near by - but also unexpected bursts of laughter!"
5, am an 8th grade student who hated to read after this book in which I read over 3 days I fell in love with the characters the story and the author...
5," For a non-reader, I find this book interesting enough for me to read from one page to another. This is the kind of book I've been looking for so long."
5, had to read a book over summer for school and I am so glad I picked this one it was so easy to pick up a read and I hat reading but I loved this one
5," this is probably one of the best books i've read since perks of being a wallflower. i'd give it 1,000,000,000,000 thumbs up if i had that many thumbs!"
5," Very sweet and touching- but real! Great characters, a book my 15 year old recommended!  He was right.  Kept me intrigued and wanting to keep reading."
5," have read this book so any times andd i still cry , every single time when i read. I think this is a book that everybody should at read lest once..."
5," Don't know too many that Cancer has not touched. This book did not dwell on the sad, but gave a glimpse into how some make the most of the inevitable."
2," This book was as great as everyone said, the fault in our stars is one to reread 100x. I am in love with Augustus and hazel and they have left a mark."
5, couldn't put it down. It kept me on my feet. It was extremely  beautiful and heart breaking at the same time thank you for writing it for the public
5, Honestly best book I've ever read and nothing like I've ever read either! Loved John Green's style of writing too. I am 16 years old and I loved this.
5," Although I cried through much of this book, I also laughed. Beautiful book, beautiful characters, and beautiful writing. I highly recommend this book."
5, perfect novel. funny but serious. amazingly awesome perfection on pages. i absolutely loved reading the love story and the real life scenarios placed.
5," John Green is my daughter's favourite writer, she just love the book, in fact she have 2 of this book. One for herself and one to lend out to friends."
5, Ripped through this book in one day. I am not one to enjoy or read romance novels but this book really took me by surprise . Read Read Read.
5, This made me cry but all those witty comments and smart assness made this book well worth the read. I agree there are only two emotions Love and Fear.
5, Very well written and very realistic.  It's a sad topic and yet the author leaves you feeling inspired.  These kids lived a full life in a short time.
5," am smitten. First book I couldn't put down in a long time. The insight is incredible. The writing is even better. John Green, who do YOU read?"
2," Great book, excellently written.  Hazel reminds me a little of Juno, kind of a wise-ass, she had me chuckling a few times despite thd subject mattter."
5," Got this book for my girlfriend for xmas, she absolutely loved it and is recommending it to her friends.  Very happy with the condition it arrived in."
5," Unspeakably profound, funny and charming, and impossibly heartbreaking. Green's most powerful book yet.And yes: I did cry. More than once."
5, This book was great I loved it.  It's a very emotional book it really tugged at my heart you cant help but fall on love with Hazel Grace and Augustus.
5," was a huge John Green fan before this book even came out, so I knew to expect a great read, but this novel still blew my mind. Read it. That is all."
5," The Fault In Our Stars is a book that anyone can find themselves sucked into, a piece that truly pulls the reader into Hazel's world and we meet Augustus and fall in love with a love story that isn't a love story, because it's a book about cancer, and love, and happiness, and oblivion, and anger, and disappointment and all the many pieces that come between.TFIOS is the type of book that makes you sit back and rethink your entire existence on the planet and how the world spins and why and maybe makes you see the world in a different life. John Green's metaphors and his voice for Hazel further enthrall readers of all sophistication. It appeals to everyone, because it isn't a cancer book or a love story, but everything surrounding the two. The Fault In Our Stars is phenomenal in that it is so irrevocably original and leaves us feeling like we owe it to Hazel and Augustus to make our own little infinity something a little bigger, and maybe our thoughts are stars we cannot fathom into constellations, but we do know that they shine a little brighter now."
5," Some of the time I really loved this book. At other times, I viewed the writing as just okay and felt the perspective left the reader, not just sad, but hopeless. To be fair, I'm much older than the targeted teen/young adult audience. Still, I recommend this book to teenagers and adults. Sometimes older adults want to dismiss today's youth as entitled, lazy, and ignorant. The author does a good job of creating empathy in the reader for each character - teens and adults alike. He helps us - no, he stretches us - to see the world and life and suffering through the different perspectives of the characters. I really liked Hazel and I adored Augustus - these two had me crying one minute and laughing out loud the next. To be honest, I wanted the characters to have hope, so much so I grasped at tiny glimmers where Gus and Hazel seemed to wonder out loud and entertain possible alternatives to their beliefs about death and finiteness. But as we are reminded again and again, the world is not a wish-granting factory. Perhaps the truest statement in the book."
5,"t is said about translations of The Bible that if the translation is faithful (as in to the original text) it is not beautiful but if it's beautiful, it is not faithful.The Fault In our Stars is a beautiful story about an ugly reality.  It is hard enough for us to watch an older loved one wasting away from cancer. But cancer is not a killer of just the very old, it can strike anyone and it is most difficult for us to accept when it is found in the very young.Sixteen year old Hazel is one such cancer victim.  Living with stage four cancer means that for her, it is not a matter of if the cancer will kill her but when.  The reality of how much her own suffering is affecting those around her leads her to be reluctant to develop new relationships until she meets Gus.  Gus seems to have beaten cancer at the cost of his leg. He teaches her that loving someone who will die soon is worth the pain.  Together they find wisdom in the writings of an enigmatic novelist, and solace in each other.Hazel learns that dying doesn't have to keep her from living."
4," First off, I will admit that the dialog seems a bit unrealistic regardless of how intelligent the teenage characters are. I was not overly distracted by this though and I do not feel like it hurt the book too much. I thoroughly enjoyed the read and finished it in two sittings. In fact, when I found myself awake at 3am and unable to back to sleep, I figured I would read until I could go back to sleep. Here I am two hours later having just finished the book and writing one my very few book reviews. I usually don't write reviews because I have a hard time putting into words why I like what I like. That seems to be the case here as well. I keep typing and deleting my thoughts on the characters and plot from my perspective as a caregiver for the sick and disabled. Any attempt I make at in-depth analysis comes out poorly worded and does not convey my feelings well. I'll just say this: dying is not pretty or graceful. John Green chose to show this instead of the saccharine, near symptomless depiction often shown in other works, especially for teens and younger."
5," Two wonderfully alive children, dying too quickly, knowing too much and living 100 lives in the span of 17 years. The story strikes fear in our very heart as it rips off the blinders of denial and requires us to see them, in full regalia, as loving, laughing, losing, dying beautiful children who will never see the ocean again, never know the end of the novel they love, never be free of the pain in their bodies nor the guild they carry for the wrecked lives around them. There is no way to read this novel and not assign the story, at moments, to our own lives. To step into each character for moments and to live the searing truth of their words, their lot in life. The poignant and poetic prose of both of these children along with their hair raising charm only serves to make it more gut wrenching, since we fall in love with them as they fall in love with each other. It's impossible not to. I hear there is a movie. But how can putting this to screen do this novel justice? It may be one movie is skip, simply to preserve what I've been given in its purest form."
2, read this book and it held my interest all the way from beginning to end. Very sad story and I never would see the movie when it came out. Too sad.
5," laughed out loud. I cried ugly sobs. I am better for having spent my day in the lives of Hazel Grace and Augustus. Thank you, Mr. green. Thank you."
5, This book will make you want to live each day to the fullest. It will make you do everything passionately and relentlessly for the rest of your life.
5," bought this because I wanted to know what the big deal was,  and I loved it. It was so witty, sad and funny. It's an instant classic in my opinion."
5,t made me think about things in a different way.  Enjoyed the characters and the writing. I hope I better understand what cancer patients go though.
5, This book was absolutely amazing and made my soul smile.  Some people get such a bum deal in life... this book definitely makes you appreciate yours.
5," just love everything about this book. You will cry a lot for sure but You will fall in love whit it. Still crying. Read it, you will not regret it."
5, lost my brother 6 months ago. This book has helped me come to terms with my emotions that I didn't want to face... I can't thank John Green enough.
5, Umm I love this book! I would really recommend this book to 13 and up since there are swear words. But most of all this book was absolutely amazing!!
5, Hazel and Gus are lovable characters sadly facing the most difficult challenges life can offer. This book inspired me look at how I live my own life.
2," Recommended by a friend; well worth the read. I love the way it was written, great verbage and dialogue. Characters are interesting and very likable."
5," could not recommend this book any higher. John Green is a wonderful storyteller, the nerdfighters are pleased.This Star Wont Go Out and DFTBA (^_^)"
5, This book is so moving. It is well written and a fast read. I had never read this author before but will definitely will be seeking more of his work.
5," This was easily the best book I've ever read , and I'm not a ' reader ' . I just wish i knew what happened to Anna's mum . And hazel and her family ."
5,f you have ever thought about dying. If you have ever been in love.  If you have ever been hurt. If you have ever wanted. A book truly for everyone.
5, This book is so heart felt. An amazingly true and blunt story of the horrors of cancer and of people who live c with it. This book is simply amazing.
5," can't think of any other word to describe this book. Just amazing. Beautiful. Heartbreaking. Fantastic. Wonderfully written. Thank you, John Green."
5, received The Fault in Our Stars by John Green in perfect condition and it was early for arriving! It was a signed copy(because I pre-ordered it)!
5, decided to read this book after the hype surrounding the movie. I wanted to read the book first bc in my opinion the books are usually better. The book was a quick read &amp; kept me interested. I only gave it two stars bc I never attached myself to the book or the characters. The ending was obvious from the beginning but I contiuned to read anyway. The plot was meh but the character development was very thin. The relationship between Hazel &amp; Augustus seemed forced &amp; fake. I never swooned or worried about them. In the end I didn't cry nor feel the slightest bit of emotion or sadness I thought for sure I would feel when picking up the book the first day. Shouldn't I have cried? Got teary eyed? I'm an over hormonal pregnant woman &amp; still did not feel one ounce of sadness for the characters!! This just shows me how poorly they were written. When the book was over I felt very meh about the whole thing &amp; really just wanted to know much like Hazel what happened in the end of AIF... That book sounded way more interesting! I would not really recommend this book.
5," The front is filled with too much teenage gestalt for my liking, but it gets much better after the two teens (SPOILER ALERT) go to Amsterdam. From that point, I think the story picks up considerably, and deepens both in emotion and storytelling. I feel like the beginning of the book sets up the real plotline, which is everything that happens after they go to Amsterdam. It is far more richly imagined and better described, beyond that point. Prior to that, I feel like there's a lot of linguistic showing off, (not entirely unbelievable, just taken to a strange place) to make us all understand that the hero and heroine are intelligent and non-conformist. For my money, there are better ways of doing that.Note: I have been around several teenage survivors, and I have a family member who did not survive. I, myself, have a genetic disability. I know that survivors of crippling illnesses grow up more quickly and mature faster. I don't argue that they/we speak/think differently, and are non-conformists. I just disagree that it comes out like this."
2,"m not good at writing reviews and I should probably wait until I've had some time to let this book sink in (and it's not 2am in the morning) but here it goes. I started it and couldn't stop...just everything about this book I love, hate, laugh, cry, get angry, get confused, mad happy. It was definitely a good book and I felt like I was right there living their lives with them but oh my goodness! my head just hurts so much.... the reason I gave it 2 stars is not because I don't love it, recommend it or etc. but rather it's more a good headache if that makes sense.. its what I'd rate the universe, with how to live, with how to understand disease and illnesses. Nothing is straight forward or easy and this book definitely has a great way of showing this. I knew it was going to be sad but 1.didn't happen in the way I thought and 2. everything involving AIA was ingenious and made me cry in a very different way (hugely effective way I surprised myself) than reading a book about a cancer girl dying after falling in love like a walk to remember for example."
3," The fault in reading it late, is that the novel becomes hyped up causing me to hold a higher expectation.Originally, I wanted to give the novel 3 stars, but what made it a 4 for me was the novel had no bulls***. It was pure honesty about having cancer - having something you can't fix in your life even if you wanted to. There's was no foreplay between Hazel and Gus which was perfect. They were meant to be together - nothing in the middle of their relationship.TIFIOS was a like a vaccine shot. You know it will hurt once you start and finish it, but it was a pain you had to get through in order to expand your thinking.--------When you have cancer you become this untouchable. They don't want pity, they just need to live their lives. Faith, hope, belief - it's all bulls*** for the living, for the people who don't know what dying pain feels like. Positivism doesn't help when death is clinging to your arm, when you see inevitable end. We all want to believe that something else exist, that maybe its just dream, but that is just not reality."
2," She has cancer.  He has cancer.  They both cope in their various ways.  They fall in love and support each other unto death (and, of course, inevitably sleep together in between those two events--what a shock).  Both are intelligent characters, well-written.  So what's not to love?  It's yet another story in which Every Single Adult--every parent, every counselor, every medical professional--is well-meaning, but clueless.  Utterly clueless.  The only exceptions are the girl's father (sometimes) and the secretary? Partner? Significant other? (it's never clearly defined WHAT exactly she is) of a famous author whose work is the girl's favorite.  Oh--and faith is ridiculed and portrayed as completely irrelevant.  Pardon me if I find such attitudes insulting.  Most teens I know are already convinced that their parents just don't understand...reading this book is a perfect way to pour more fuel on that fire.  No thanks--this has been the ONLY Kindle download I've ever deleted from my list--though it was worth buying just for research purposes."
4," Every so often a story comes along and stops time and let's you THINK. This is such a story! Beautiful, touching and real. A love story for the ages"
3, Was very disappointed in this book.  With all of the advertisement and talk about this book being made into a movie? I don't think it will be a hit.
5," This book is incredible, and the story of Augustus and Hazel is so sweet. By the end of the book I was sobbing, I can't wait to watch the movie now!"
5, Love the characters and story between to cancer patients and find the beauty among themselves. Definitely a good read for young adults and teenagers
2," This is nicely written young adult romance.  It is not the typical supernatural type love story, a nice change of pace and definitely a tear jerker!"
5,t was beautiful and so amazing. I never have read a book so inspirational and sad. His death makes you sad. I bawled my eyes out. I love this book!
4," This read was both entertaining, as in laugh out loud, and philosophical, as in who are we in the big scheme of things. Highly recommended"
5," Very good read! Sad story, but  I really enjoyed it..good characters, interesting! Young love! You will enjoy this book! If you choose to read it!!!"
4, Never thought I'd fall in love with another couples love. Love love love this book. Not what I thought it was going to be which made me love it more
5," Enjoyed it very much. Will read it again. Wonderful. Will suggest this book to my family and friends. John Green, will not forget this tender story."
5," Super insightful,intelligent,sweet,sweet book.Admittedly, I hesitated because I thought the book would be depressing but it is well worth the tears."
5,ve never called a book beautiful but I suppose that's because I've never read one. That's really all I have to say about it until I read it again.
5, THIS BOOK MADE ME WANT TO RIP MY HEART OUT AND DIVE INTO THE OCEAN BECAUSE IT'S SO BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN AND EVERYTHING ABOUT IT IS TRAGICALLY PERFECT
5," Like everyone is saying, this is Mr. Green's best novel yet. He gets into Hazel's head so perfectly. I was enthralled from the beginning to the end."
2," The Fault in Our Stars has been reviewed by, praised by, and inspiring to millions world wide. It is not your average cancer story nor is it your average story at all. It is a soft kiss in today's world of sex. It stirs emotions that no other piece of modern literature can. For in a society that cancer is so prominent in no one has ever given us a look at it like this. Now it is not a cancer book, it is a beautiful love story. Now it's also not one of those sappy paper back novels you buy to read at the beach. It's a love story that makes you want to experience a true, innocent, passionate love. The characters in the story are wise beyond their years, but not in a way that turns you away. In a way that makes you wish to be wise and to think as they thought. It is a story that captures your mind as well as your heart. For in this story it is like you are sucked into their own little infinity, granted a chance to live another life. So read on and enjoy but be warned when you finish you will not be the same.Okay?Okay."
5," By young adult I mean it is a young adult genre work. If you are one, or you live with one, or ever were one or lived with one in your life, you can appreciate this one for the work that it is.By emotional and frustrating I mean the topic is highly charged emotionally, as young adults can certainly be, add to that cancer in teens, it's heartrending. By frustrating i DON'T mean the writing style or any lack of cohesiveness or style by John Green. It is very well done, very. With this topic and theme, it could be truly sappy; but it's so far from that. This is one of those 'just when you think you might have a relatively happy ending,' reality smacks you on the side of the head, and all you can do is shake your own.  Character development is very good; these are teens with insight, intelligence, clearly older than their years. Their illness has pushed them to grow to the point that they seem wiser than their respective parents. Not really surprising.Personal opinion: adults should read more young adult books, because boy, do we forget."
5," Want to get in the head of a teen with Cancer? No, me neither, it's a heart aching thought to comprehend, but somethings are out of our control, but that's exactly what happens when you read this book, and what you uncover/see when you get there is not what you expect, though it actually should be.Life is a long learning road, or so we think. The truth, as you see in this book, is it can easily be cut short, with fate being the evil hiding behind every nook and cranny. In reality we don't get to choose what happens, how it happens or whom is around when it happens. 'The world wants to be noticed', and will jolt you awake before crashing down on you with all that it has, to suck everything right out of you. Hazel and Augustus are allowed to fall in love and experience it to a mass degree, deep within themselves and each other, but as we find out, even love doesn't beat the most brutal attacks.While reading this book I smiled, cried, got angry and then repeated all those throughout. This is definatly a book to read, one for everyone."
4," The book starts out with these kids with cancer, who are all deeply flawed and deeply brilliant, who say and think witty things I only wish I were smart or funny enough yo say or think myself. The fact that they are dying is always there, but it becomes an accepted part of the story - that their days have an expiration date on them that is much more real than our own because it could happen at any time. And then there's the book, The one they're obsessed with. It's a book about kids with cancer, except it's so not a book about cancer, which becomes like an inside joke between the author and the reader because this very book is also a book about kids with cancer, but is so not a book about cancer.I fell in love with this story,  and with the characters. I genuinely cared for them, and cared what happened to them. There were many times I laughed out loud while reading, and a few when I cried, and one entire chapter where I did both at the same time.I cannot recommend this book enough. I feel more complete having read it."
5," Once again Shakespeare lives. By no means I claim that John Green is the master of the English language. However, he ought to be proclaimed a mini Shakespeare. Themes such as coming of age, life and death, and love are explored through this book. The Fault in Our Stars is a book to be read in a day.If you know John Green's personality from you-tube's videos then you will automatically find traits of him in the protagonist. Is John Green a character in the book. The answer is no. Green's expression lives in his characters but does not overpower their own personality a the story unveils. It is a clearly Shakespearean coming of age novel as a young couple struggle against the forces of time and space to live their romance. *Spoiler alert* Like most of tragedies it ends with death.Personally, read the book before watching the movies, and I did not regret it. The book plays clearly displays the characters and their emotions in such a ways that Hollywood cannot compete. I encourage everyone to read it from beginning to end."
5," The Fault in Our Stars will break your heart, I just want to let you know so you're prepared. Buy a box of tissues first. You will laugh, cry, smile and consider donating money to the Make a Wish foundation. What makes this story so heartbreaking is that it is so real. There are a lot of people who fight cancer on a daily basis, and I'm sure you know of at least one person. The Fault in Our Stars is a book that everyone can relate to and some people might not be able to read because its content is too sad.But it is also an incredibly happy story. It is a story filled with hope and strength. It's a book about growing up, falling in love, and just wanting to feel normal. John Green creates very three dimensional characters who you grow to understand as you would your best friend, he is talented I tell you. For me this was the first book I have read by him, I know, where have I been? I am pleased to say that it was a great introduction, although I hope he doesn't break my heart so badly the next time I read something he has written."
5," second best book I've ever read, the first being looking for Alaska also by John green. I will say one thing to you Mr. John Green, Nicely phrased."
4, This book sounded interesting--reviews sounded good. It's a great book if you think the twilight series is great literature. Lots of teenage angst.
5, will remember this story forever. It gives so much insight into cancer patients. You also fall in love with the characters. Definitely memorable.
5, absolutely loved this book! I couldn't put it down! The characters each have a different inspiring affect on the reader and I give it five stars.
2, This book is an amazing book. It tells a real life love story. But it is so so sad. You'll definitely she'd some tears. I can't wait for the movie!
5, loved it! It made me laugh it made me cry. It was a very humbling book to read. I fell in love with the story. Loved the way the author ended it.
5, Amazing book with an amazing love story. I was determined tp finish the book through tears. It drags you in and leaves you with a feeling of pride.
5," The writing really puts you right there with the characters in the book. Sweet, joyful and sorrow filled moments that grab you and keep you reading"
5, The story and characters are outstanding. The tone is uplifting considering it is about death and cancer. I thought the author did any amazing job!
5, The book was the greatest book I've ever read and I learned so much about not only cancer but that love is not loss within sickness but it grows it
5, was disppointed in this. It's not as good as everyone makes it out to be. I thought it'd have a lot more depth to it but it's just a simple read.
5, love John green and I love this book. It was beautifully written and inspirational. Hazel's and Gus's relationship was amazing. I loved this book
3, The feels are indescribable. Green really does out do himself sometimes. Awesome great Incredible Beast Unbelievable Insane Totally Undeniably Sick
5," Loved the characters and how the author developed the story.  Challenging topic, but definitely loved it!  Now reading another book by same author."
2,m speechless after reading this.It's a beautiful and great story that everyone should read.I'm excited to read the rest of his books.
5, Amazing from the beginning to the end !!!!  The main characters were outstanding and hilarious !! Makes me look at life in a different perspective.
5, loved this book and would recommend it to anyone who wanted to read something strangely uplifting. Beautiful characters and a creative storyline.
5, Read this after my adult niece said it was a must-read. The characters and real-life emotions kept me up late reading since I couldn't put it down.
5," You've no doubt heard people rave in book reviews, that they couldn't put it down.  I am here to make the same statement.  Couldn't. Put. It. Down."
5, Cried like a baby breathtaking tragic love story between Augustus and hazel Grace and the like v e they  had for  one another will forever live on.
5, The book came as fast as promised and in great shape. The price was fantastic-I didn't realize it was a hardback until I received it. Very pleased.
5, This is truly a breathtakingly funny and beautifully sad book. cried and laughed at the same time. Thank you John Green for The Fault in Our Stars.
5, This was a wonderful book with characters you fall in love with from the start. Great message and opens your mind to what the reality of cancer is.
5," don't want to make this too long but this book is indescribable . You can tell that the author didn't just write this book for money or fame but he wrote it because he new this could be a real life situation and that the deep down inside he was meant to write this. This is not a book though,neither is it a story,it's an adventure that you feel you are part if. You become the characters. I always find it interesting that people cry when in agony or defeat or are sad. Why do tears come from your eyes when in these situations. I cried while reading this book,I'll admit it,but the real sorrow I felt didn't come out by crying. If anyone in the word could live a life where they never cried would that mean that they were never sad or in defeat. So i am not going to say I cried my heart out when reading this but that doesn't mean I was not crying inside. So do buy this book and really think about what life is really worth,how important it actually is. If you read this I promise you that you will become more intelligent in many ways.😊"
2," All last year I felt guilty for not having read The Fault In Our Stars by John Green. How could I call myself a YA fan and not have read such a popular book? Well, today I remedied that situation. Start to finish. Cover to cover. Quite a lot of Kleenex.At its heart, The Fault In Our Stars is a teenage love story set against the backdrop of cancer. Hazel drags her oxygen tank everywhere she goes and Augustus has a prosthetic leg. Both are erudite, witty, and converse in a fashion that I’ve never heard teenagers sound like ever–and I’ve been around a lot of smart teens. Like, literally, I’ve never heard teens talk like that. Still, the Gilmore-Girl-esq dialogue is fun to read, although if it doesn’t come across as realistic.If you enjoy tear-jerkers, this is a great book for you. If you’d rather not put yourself through an emotional wringer, stay away. The only thing that bothered me was Augustus and his unlit cigarette. Hopefully that doesn’t spawn a fad of cigarettes becoming cool again even if they aren’t smoked."
5," Read it over a weekend, fast read, totally enjoyable.  I look forward to reading John Green's other books.  I'm hoping they are just as enjoyable."
2, Poignant and lovely. A beautiful read. My heart still hurts... John Green has his way with words and uses that power to twist them into your soul.
5, The book was slow at first and I couldn't get into but once I did it was one of the most amazing touching and surprising stories I have ever read!
5," laughed.  cried.  smiled. and thought about the metaphors used,  something to think about.  I recommend this book, especially to younger readers"
5, Hazel and Augustus take you along with them on their journey as they discover love and frailty in such a lovely exchange. This is a definite read!
5,t was a really great book but it is really for older\more experienced readers. It can be hard to understand if you are not an experienced reader.
5, Favorite book by far! John Green is an excellent writer!:) Ordering another one of hi  books asap! Absolutely brilliant and loving the characters!
5, There are no words to describe how much I love this book. It has changed the way I look at life and made me cry a few times. Absolutely brilliant.
5, Just finished reading this book....it's left me speechless. I would definitely recommend it to anyone and everyone. Definitely one of my favorites
5, This book is very well written The story is just amazing. The characters are heroic. I fell in love with this book and will definitely re-read it.
5, after reading about 5 pages- I was hooked! This book Is impossible to put down- you'll be in love and attached to the charectors nearly instantly!
2,t is a literal emotional rollercoaster.Be prepared with a box of tissues and a friend that has read it so they'll understand your emotions.
5," love this book! I wish I could enter the book to meet the characters . I almost didn't read it because it sounded so sad, but I'm so glad I did."
5,nspiring and wonderful in every way. It made me think and it made me cry and the story was lovely. Definitely makes it into my list of favorites.
5, This book is a quick read and quite enjoyable. I laughed out loud at certain descriptions and dialogue and very much enjoyed the story as a whole.
5, This book is my new favorite! I can't just choose one thing that was my favorite! Amazing story and amazing character development!!! Read now!!!!!
5," Beautiful book. Great writing. Great characters. Some necessary comic relief. The whole book club loved it. Please write another book, John Green."
5, love this story. My daughters laughed and cried. I would recommend for 12+. Their is some subject matter that may be difficult for younger kids.
5," Smart writing, complicated charismatic characters (even Van Houten), authentic tragedy in our human plodding toward love and oblivion. Great read."
5," This book is unique in its approach to its topic, childhood cancer. No sparkly skin or moving eyed mortals. Just good writing without the cliches."
5, gave this book a five. It contains the perfect emotions words. Ad John Green&lt;3 I fell in love with Augustus Waters and Hazel Grace Lancaster
2, The main characters' rhetoric is sure to delight those with an appreciation for rich language. A love story that will warm even the coldest heart.
5," Just a really amazing story about some cancer kids and their life, their loves. Very smartly written. Witty, humorous, thought provoking dialogue."
5, John Green is an excellent writer. He told an incredibly sad story with grace and sensitivity. Have some Kleenex on hand while you read this book.
5," The main character isn't likable, but that's ok. She feels real, and that lets the story draw you in, and actually make a difference in your life."
5, loved this book!! It was very easy to read but also well written. I liked the characters and the different personalities.. Would read it again !
5," This book was amazing, I actually bought it way back when it was originally released, very worth the money. I would buy this book 1000 times over."
5, This book is my new favorite. And I must it's hard for me to like a book this much. I ordered a bunch for my friends and family that like to read.
5," This book will inspire you to be a better person. It is a story of love, and life. I loved this book. I really really loved this book. I will admit I was afraid to read it because of the topic, I mean kids having cancer is just wrong in general. Anyway, this book had me in the very beginning. Hazel was witty and at times so deeply educated for a sixteen year old; however, she had her true sixteen year old girl moments which made her relatable to the long past sixteen year old I once was. Isaac was also a great addition to the character line up. And Augustus.....sweet,sweet boy. I was upset with the author for a few minutes but the story wouldn't have been complete and so in depth without what occurred. I can appreciate it now but it took a few minutes, I cannot lie. Anyway, well written and thoughtful book. I have developed respect and adoration for this book which surprised me. I don't have children but I found this book so well written and thoughtful, I will probably read it again which would be a first for me. Well done Mr. Green."
5," CANCER...John Green gives insight into the life of a teenager with cancer...their take in the tumultuous, hopeless, tailspin of terminal illness.I hadn't read a novel on this topic and was fairly impressed.At moments the story tended to lag and carry on very slowly, but the intended message and points were made.Its difficult to find love and prosper in a life where you're living to die, but if there isn't any hope than why even care. But we're given a very good reason to read on...John Green portrayed what I feel was a very realistic take on the views and internal dialogue that one would encounter having lived with cancer and had no hope in healing.I wish the ending had more to it. I was a bit let down - I was devastated of course, but something was going to happen, I just wasn't prepared for it.This was thoroughly well written and flowed cohesively.You will need the kleenex and an open heart to take in the depth and heaviness of this one."
5, My daughter kept insisting I read this book before the movie came out. At the time I wasn't in the mood and we still watched the movie. Fast forward 6 months and something about the book kept coming up so I decided to read it finally. I loved how the book is written. Augustas Waters made me smile every time he talked. Granted in my minds eye I was thinking of the people who portrayed these characters in the movie which helped me love the book more.I have never had cancer so to be honest I can not say how people feel but it gave you a in site of how it's like to live with a illness try to live as normal of a life and still find love in the mist of living with cancer.  Loved the way way he called her Hazel Geace and the way they talked to each other. You felt the emptiness after Augustas passed and hoping he would pop up out of no where. Even though I knew the ending (due to the movie) I still rooted they would make it.This was the first book I read of John Greens and happy my daughter kept insisting I read it.
2," love every word I read in this book. I cried I laughed. It brought back so many memories of the people I have lost from cancer.I read a lot of different genres as well as write in the Teen/Young adult genre. When I read something I love I can't seem to put it down. I say John Green did a wonderful job telling this story. Now i can't wait to watch the movie based on this book as to see the characters brought to life. In fact one of my favorite teen actresses is playing Hazel.This is a book I would read again. I recommend. In fact i already have shared it with my friends and family. Hopefully they love as much as I do.I loved the story of going through Hazel's struggle of a terminal cancer, not the fact that she went through it though. I love seeing her make friends and find a love. Cried when she lost that love.Great work, John Green. I can only hope my work can inspire and be as great as yours.Thank you for a wonderful read!Sincerely,J. R. Tyger (Teen author)"
5," Who didn't read this book this past year? This was a book that really hooked me on Young Adult and made me realize that just because the main characters are teenagers, that doesn't mean what they are going through isn't real, heartbreaking, and mature.That being said, if you didn't read this book, it's about two young adults who are both dealing with serious illnesses but are still trying to be able to act as teenagers. The whole story is real and raw and is so unfair that young people should ever have to give up these fun years in order to receive treatment or go to support groups. Augustus and Hazel were such lovable characters that you were afraid to read on for the simple fact that something might happen to them.This book was beautiful and ugly and made you fall in love with everything about it. I loved all of the characters in this book and it broke my heart over and over again. And it will guarantee to make you feel the same.That's the thing about pain... it demands to be felt..."
5," After seeing this book on the shelves of bookstores and various friends' houses, and hearing so much about John Green but not having read his work before, I decided to give this a try. I browsed the first few pages using the Amazon Look Inside feature, and was roped in immediately. Once I received the book and dove in, I couldn't put it down and finished in almost one sitting. I will not say that it is the best book I ever read, or that John Green is now my favorite author, but I did enjoy this story. I became very attached to the characters and their endeavors, and even shed more than a few tears at various points in the book.I will say that while Green is talented and has a distinguished literary voice, I still think that there are elements of his work that can be sharpened up; for instance, there were times I found the characters, their actions, and dialogue less-than-believable. Overall, however, this is a good, quick read that will take you on a gratifying journey. It's also great if you need a good cry."
5," This didnt do a lot for me, i have to confess. It's not so much that the characters weren't believable as that they were pretty bland and I didn't really care a lot about any of them. I think there's a kind of emotional blackmail operating in novels with this kind of subject matter i.e. sparky, intrinsically likeable children/young adults with terminal illnesses battling with the awful hand that Fate has dealt them. Somehow one is made to feel a heel if you say you don't enjoy reading about how they cope but, to be honest, I began to feel subtly manipulated only a few pages in, for this very reason. It just wasn't good enough, as a novel, for this adult reader anyway. It's a book for teenagers, not a particularly taxing one to read, dealing reasonably competently with a difficult subject. No more, no less. Not sure why it is being inflicted on grownup book groups where you could be reading amazing grownup stuff. Almost certainly it makes a much better film than a book."
4," Great story, great book and how honest these kidswhere and how strong they were and there attitude was.I am sure it is a great movie."
3, would recommend this book to my friends.  The part about Amsterdam was interesting.  I look forward  toReading other books by John Green.
4," As everyone has already stated, this is a great book that will not be easily forgotten.  I am sure it is one I will want to read again and again."
4," Wonderful, John Green surprised me with every new chapter. I was delighted with the perfect ending which perfectly wrapped up the book to an end."
5, really enjoyed reading this book. I never could put it down. It was really good but also really sad. I recommend this book to teens and adults.
5," Such a beautiful love story. Perfect twist to happily ever after. However, do not read this book in public.  You will cry. Well with the money."
2, Amazing and uplifting story! Couldn't put it down. From beginning to end I was hooked. Definitely a must read!!! Can't wait to see the movie too.
5," was so caught up in this story. The characters are funny, smart, and believable. Although it is a book for young people, anyone would enjoy it."
5, don't think I've ever cried this much while reading a book. This book impacted my life by changing the way I view cancer victims and true love.
5, One of the best ever. Be prepared to cryand laugh From the beginning to the end. It really makes you think about what is important in life.
5, this book just looks like the way I want it to be. I totally love it. And it was brand new when I got it. Never broken because of the deliver. :)
5, Here i am crying at words on a page simple stupid words on a page that i have come to love and lose. I hate you john green and your amazing words
5," Wonderful story of hardships in adolescents especially w cancer. Great characters! Would love to see this as a movie, maybe for hallmark channel!"
5," A touching, witty, uplifting, heartbreaking tale of young love and self discovery. John Green hit another home run.  My favorite of his writings."
5, found this book quite beautiful. I loved the the feeling between Hazel and Gus. I have to say it really touched my heart without destroying it.
5, had been dying to read this book forever because I just became a Nerdfighter and I finally got the chance. IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE SO READ IT.
2," This book was so much more than a story about young love. I became highly invested in the characters, which, to me, is the sign of a great story."
5,"t was amazing. Ending was so unexpected. The wrong person died, beautifully written though. Half expected ot to end like AIA in the middle of a-"
5," Received the book in perfect quality, the story brought me to tears. I read it over 3 times, and I just can't get enough of the John Green books."
5," This book was very hard to put down. It was raw, inspiring and seemed very honest. Should be on every high school book list as a compulsory read!"
5, would have rated this ten stars but I couldn't.  This is truly an amazing book and I would recommend it to anyone who is capable of reading it.
5," Omg, this story is heratbreaking!. This novel is beyond perfect, the history, the characters, the writing, everything!. I'm so happy I bought it."
5, This book was much a good read. I kind of figured out was going to happen about half way through it but I still loved it. Definitely a must read.
5," Dear John Green,Thanks. It wasn't like I needed my heart anyway. Thank you for such a beautiful book. Off to read Looking for Alaska!"
5, Loved it. What a bitter sweet story of teenage love! Reminded me a whole lot of My Sisters Keeper....the personal life of the sister with cancer.
5," A frank treatment of a terrible disease.  The beautiful language used to describe the characters, their thoughts and their world was mesmerizing."
2, Most ammmaaaazzinng book I have ever read. Will touch the hearts of many! I lice ok t so much it is my new favorite bookS I'm sure it'll be yours
5, The Fault in our Stars is an incredible book. John Green does an amazing job of portraying these characters and gives us tons if memorable lines.
5," Just buy it right now. If you're a girl, prepare to cry. This book is full of beautiful emotion and will make you appreciate life in a new light."
5," Having just finished reading this book, I am in awe.  John Green effortlessly delves into the intelligent teenager's mind.  So nice to see the persona of a young intellect displayed so realistically.  The book is emotionally fulfilling, and impossible to set down.  I found myself reliving my young adulthood through this novel, and while cancer was not my plight (thank G-d), every individual goes through the pain and angst (as well as the biting sarcasm and realism) that is so integrally part of the teenage years.This being the first review I have ever written, the power of that alone speaks volumes.  After many years of reading mostly nonfiction, The Fault in Our Stars pulled me back into the world of novels and fictional literature, so much so that I am writing this at 4:45 AM after staying up to read the novel in its entirety.An excellent choice for mature young adults and adults.  Please be aware that it is intensely emotional and realistic.I cannot wait to read more of John Green's work!"
5," We have always been snobs about books on tape but recently took a road trip and this book was recommended to us so we thought we would give it a try.  The tape opens with a very depressing and sad story so my husband nixed the tape for the rest of the trip.  However I drove back with the kids alone (hubby stayed for a few more days for business).  I decided to give The Fault in our Stars another go while the kids slept in the back seat.  After about 20 minutes, I was hooked!  My middle school daughter woke up and made me start the cd again from the beginning.  There are some very mature themes and references to sex that were a bit uncomfortable to hear with a middle school daughter that is young for her age, but at some point we have to break that ice anyway.  The story was beautiful and the narrator (Kate Rudd) does an absolutely amazing job of portraying many different characters in the story. By the time the story ended, we were so sad because we got so accustomed to hearing such an incredible story read so well."
5," read about a chapter and a half from the book before going to school this morning. lemme tell you, that is not a good idea. especially if you're wearing makeup. I was bawling. I have only cried about one other book before (the Divergent series) but within two sentences of the chapter I had turned into a waterfall. John Green weaves words together with grace and the intent to make you think about life and death and the Beyond. He makes you think about the beauty of sadness and the pain of loving. everything in and about this book makes you think even after you're done reading, when you aren't reading you're thinking about it. I think any book that can make you think and feel is great. but this book has honestly changed the way I think and I think that is wonderful and if I could talk to John and tell him what I think about this book, well that would be amazing for starters and also I would tell him precisely how much this book means to me. I think that would amazing.I do, I really do.Thank you John Green."
5," This book presents love, humor, and tragedy in a way that has never been presented before. It may seem cheesy at first, but it's not. The writing style has a magnificent choice of vocabulary, and the humor did actually make me laugh. The love the two characters hold for each other is so powerful you can almost feel it; the chemistry between them is almost real. These things are not my favorite parts of the book, though. My favorite part is that the characters are likeable and you connect to them. Hazel isn't bitchy, demanding, or perfect (Mary-Sue) at all. Her intelligence and realism surprised me. She is a main character I actually liked. Augustus is not your typical Prince Charming, instead he is a funny guy who I would love to be around. Isaac is not annoying, he is like Augustus; funny and loveable. The author goes into such detail you feel the love and pain the characters are feeling. It is an amazing book, but the ending makes you cry big-time. That's saying quite a bit considering most sad books don't make me cry."
5," really liked this book, didn't expect certain things to happen the way they did. I wanted more,it was sad , funny, and it just stays with you."
5," always enjoy reading a book that has a movie coming out, this one was particularly a must! A story of young love, and realistic, unfortunately"
5, loved this book.  I has to be one of the saddest I have read though.  I bought it this morning and could not put it down until I was finished.
2, Fantastic book! Well written about a painful subject that allows you to experience the world of terminal patients from a joyful and happy place.
5, really enjoyed this book. I recommend it to reader's who look for this sort of storyline. I hope you enjoy reading this book as much as I did.
5," A powerful book about life and death, and how we try to muddle through the world, and make sense if it all. Poignant, thoughtful, and brilliant."
5," This is my all time favorite book ever. EVER. I cried, I laughed, I cried again. It's seriously the best book. Its definitely a reread for sure."
5," From the beginning, this book had me captured. Loved the character, loved the story, and loved the depth... would recommend this book to anyone."
5," Another brilliant novel by John Green! It was beautifully written, thought-provoking, and so real. Thanks for a good laugh and a good cry, John!"
5," Wow. That's all I can say. I've never read another book like it! I loved it and recomend it to everyone! (If I could give it 10 stars, I would!)"
5, A beautiful book that cuts you into pieces in ways you can't help but love. Incredibly complex and breathtakingly simple all at once. Wonderful.
5, bought this product for someone else - I received it as promised and expected in excellent condition beyond that I cannot speak to the product
5," This novel was heartbreaking yet uplifting. It is appropriate for teens and adults alike, probably resonates more with adults who have children."
2, Amazing book about real events. I highly recommend it to anyone that want to know what it's like to have cancer or what it's like to be in love.
5," picked this up based on reader reviews and for once, I wasn't disappointed. Lovely poignant story. Highly recommended. I couldn't put it down."
5," loved this book. Made me smile, laugh, fall in love, and hurt. The world is not a wish granting factory but this book was a dream come true (:"
5, chose five stars because it was shipped to me way in advance than the estimated time. Also this book was so amazing and I am really impressed.
5, found this book after seeing mentions of it on tumblr and I absolutely loved it. The two characters were funny and brilliant and tear-jerking.
5, This book was a fast read for me .  I couldn't put it down.  It had me laughing and crying.  Definitely worth the money and time!  Great read!!!
5," The story is really original, romantic, funny and sad at the same time. I really loved this book! It made me cry and laugh :) You should buy it!"
5," absolutely loved this book. You will probably cry both happy and sad tears. A good read, it left an impact on me. So happy I bought this book!"
5, just have finished the book and I am crying. I highly recommend this if you want an emotional love story that you will never lose interest in.
5," purchased this book after seeing the trailer for the upcoming movie.  I had no idea just how powerful and moving this story would be.  I read it in less than 24 hours and can honestly say I don't remember the last time I cried that much.  I am glad that the author gave a disclaimer that this book is not based upon real people, however, I am sure that there are young adults who face battles such as this every single day.  Cancer is an ugly, non-discriminating and tragic disease.  This book gave me a new respect, admiration and sympathy for all those families who are faced with the tragedy of a cancer diagnosis and the ensuing fight they undertake every single day.  God bless all the families who could have written this book based upon their personal experiences and all those lives that are taken by cancer long before they deserved to depart this world.If you are looking for a light, feel good read this is not the book for you.  However, if you are looking for a profound read then I recommend this book 100%."
2,"t is a rare thing for me to identify with the issues of YA fiction as a grown-up rather than nostalgically remembering my own adolescence.  Hazel Grace and Augustus are so much more than typical teenagers or sappy archetypal cancer kids and they deal with love and loss. disappointment and mortality with nuanced brilliance.  While many may attempt to slightly diminish Green's triumph for failing to present realistic teenagers, I think this is the greatest asset of &lt;i&gt; The Fault in Our Stars &lt;/i&gt;.  Green presents his protagonists as individuals, yearning and desiring souls with ambitions, philosophies, vocabularies, and reading lists that transcend both their ages and their diagnoses, which makes for a truly compelling, beautiful, and elegiac reflection on the nature of life and literature.  And unlike many of the other reviews I've read who pay the novel the compliment of their endless weeping, I want to say I read it a full speed with clear, dry eyes and a full heart, because it gave me such tremendous hope."
5," 1-Sweet story: Yes, it's a really sweet story that you can read in a weekend2-Life/Death view: Yes, it touches your heart and you can feel and live the agony of the characters. Realistic point of view about cancer and current treatments3-Light reading: Yes, its literary level and the effort you will need to make for reading,understanding and following the story won't be that much. It's really enjoyable, of course, really sad, too. Be aware.Why 3/5? It's a bestseller. That's the kind of reading/literary way it was writtenRecommendations:1-Place: It's something you can read anywhere, office, airplane, airport,home,beach, etc.2-Age: From teenagers to 120 years old (If you older, don't read a book, but make a party please!)3-Additional: Apart from watching the current film, watch these other film: Griffin and Phoenix (2006) and Stricken (1998)They all give us an understanding of how important is love in our lives when suffering of an illness such cancer."
4," Just like Hazel and Gus, I want to know what happens after the book ends. What's more, I desperately wish I knew them before and during. John Green gives words a musical rhythm and flow that very few authors successfully achieve. I have highlighted at least 20 different phrases and sentences in this book. TFiOS is beautiful and devastating, hilarious and heartbreaking. Vlogbrothers fans will hear John's voice on each page. He credits others with the inspiration for these characters, but I think their finest traits; humanity, compassion, humor, intelligence, and a dash of nerdy sexiness come straight from Green himself. As a fan since 2008, I am excited to see his popularity skyrocket. At the same time though, I can relate to Hazel's thoughts on An Imperial Affliction- I don't know if I want to share this book. I like the idea that it is my secret. (too late for that...) I will just have to take the other option and insist that EVERYONE I know read this book."
3," Those who set out to read this book know how it is going to end: someone is going to die. Cancer is going to sink her claws into another victim and the reader will be left with a raw feeling on his or her heart. When I first finished the book, all I could think was “Dang it  John Green. Dang it you certain unnamed ASU Instructor for making me read this dang book”. I was raw, cut open, and moved to real tears. I know that Augustus and Hazle are fictional characters, but their powerful story resonates with me. I have lost many people that I love over the years to cancers unmerciful whims. So while I can say that this is a story I will never read again, I still feel that it is a story that needs to be heard. A Fault in our Stars shows not only the plight of the characters as they suffer, but who they are despite their suffering. There is no sense of unrealistic heroes who battle cancer and win, just the overall knowledge that even if these people are going to lose the battle to cancer, by God they will do so fabulously."
5," TFIOS is one of my favorites. I'm not much of a crier, but by the end of this book I was full-on bawling. There are no words to describe how I felt while reading this book, or how I felt when I finally finished it. Cancer is something that not many people are willing to discuss, and I loved the in-depth exploration of cancer patients and what they go through. Of course I realize that not all cancer patients experience this, but I imagine that some of them do.There are plenty of reviewers talking about how the characters didn't talk like teenagers. One, not all teenagers talk the same way. Two, when you have a near death experience (or have to face your own mortality at a young age), you grow up pretty quickly. Sometimes you begin to speak a different way. You want to learn everything that you can as fast as you can. You want to become a version of yourself that you imagine you'd be when you grow older...just in case you don't make it.I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I'd recommend it to all."
5," fell in love with this book the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once. i willingly chose to let this book hurt me. and i am glad."
5," A very honestly written story about falling in love and dying too young. I laughed, cried and was deeply touched by this story. Life is a gift."
5," Will never be annoyed by slow moving people again! After all, you never know what they are going through and when their time on earth will end."
5," This book is a little reminder on what is important in life. No regrets will be made reading this book, just make sure you have some kleenexes."
5,"t was a beautiful, heart touching book about the love shared between to teens trying to fight their cancer. I cried the entire time I read it."
2, the book was wonderful and brought me to tears many times.  It was spot on in my experience as far as feelings go on both sides of the disease.
5, This story is well written and while dealing with a very tragic topic it illustrates how people can triumph even in the worst of circumstances.
5," Awesome read.. I loved this book! Great insight by the author! It's funny, witty and well thought out. You'll fall on love with the characters."
5, Love this book so much! So touching and amazing could not live without John green he is greatjust amazing an amazing writer so talented!!
5," truly enjoyed reading this book. I could not put the book down, I was captivated by the language and the plot. John Green has a new follower."
5," This book is incredible. It is rich with life, love, tragedy, and the beautiful musings of things bigger than ourselves. Read it. Just read it."
5, really enjoyed reading this book at the beach. It had well built characters and I enjoyed the relationships created. Everyone should read it.
5, Wow it made me realize what they go through. I never knew how tough till that book. All I can say is you won't get disappointed that's for sure
5," A book that makes you feel everything. A captivating and unique story, with wonderfully developed characters. You will not want to put it down."
5, cried and grateful for the story at the same time. Read it. A sadness that you wish you could change but glad they experienced what they did.
2, The only other book I have read aside from the diary of a young girl by Anne Frank that made me cry. Very real. And the coincidence is fitting.
5, had to read this book for English. It was not like the normal required reading books. I loved it. It makes you look at the world differently.
5," don't reread books much, but this is so good I just can't resist visiting the story over and over again. May be the best book I've ever read."
5," READ READ READ READ READ READ READ READ READ *PLEASE READ* this book is just amazing, Green couldn't of done a better job. Just read it dammit."
5, Loved it ...it was a different take on a typical teen love story..to find such a love as true as that of hazel and Gus would be...extraordinary
5, Truly inspiring and beautifully written. This book is fantastic. Any book written by John Green is absolutely worth reading. I love John Green.
5, Some may consider it belonging to the Teen genre but adults will enjoy and should learn some valuable lessons about living life to its fullest.
5, A very powerful and well written story.  It's a book that is hard to read because you want to change the inevitable but impossible to put down.
5, So good that I'm sad it's over and already planning to read it again. Prepare for the water works but also for a chance to count your blessings
5," This is one of the most beautiful stories I have read - genuine and heartfelt, asking real questions and inspiring the reader to do so as well."
2, Great read for tween to adult. Funny and sad. Hazel the main character has great names for all her medical equipment and other cancer patients.
5," What an amazing book. So raw and real life. Not endings are happy ones but that what makes this book great. It's truth, which makes it perfect."
5, couldn't put this book down. I read it in record time and can't stop thinking about the characters.It is very emotional but I loved it.
5, This is one of the most incredible books I've ever read. It's beautiful in so many ways and also incredibly haunting in the material it covers.
5, My daughter has read and highly recommended this book.  I am looking forward to readhing it.  It was much less expensive than at the book store
5, have never been so determined to finish a book and find out what happens next. I read it in less than 24 hours. Amazingly sad and insightful.
5, an excellent thought provoking book for young adults and adults.  It can provide a way to communicate with your child if he/ she likes to read.
5, This is by far John Green's best book to date. It talks about what it is like to be a kid with cancer realistically instead of idealistically.
5," didn't know the subject matter of The Fault In our Stars before reading, thankfully, or I probably wouldn't have picked it.  I did know it was a coming-of-age story and then started to see quotes on Pinterest.  Very smart quotes and I was intrigued.  I'm so glad I was - it's the kind of book that stays with you, makes you think, melts your heart, makes you dream.  It's beautiful!If there's anyone (who was like me) left on the planet who does not know this books premise, I will spare you the details and encourage you to take a leap.  At times the teenagers are not typical, and most likely wouldn't say the eloquent lines and amazing thoughts they do, but it's the type of book that you give liberty to because it's the type of line you would have want said.  There is a lot of perfection in this book mixed with heavy doses of reality.The characters are as charming as they come.  The humor delightful.  It ripped my heart out in the best of ways.  I absolutely loved this book.  Will read again."
5," The whole story revolves around romance, poetry, and  deep thinking but it also involves much more. This book includes fighting and never stopping... just never giving up. Even when things got bad for Hazel, and God knows they did, she would never think lesser about her condition. She was never healthy or whole, but she was also never sick. If that makes sense. What I'm trying to say is that Hazel didn't try to tell herself she was healthy, but she believed in herself too.Reading this book is like taking a trip through a dry lake and filling it with tears and love.Augustus is a funny, sarcastic, and most of all, sweet character. He loved Hazel even when he didn't know her. Tragedy was what brought them together and tragedy was what tore them apart. But like any pair of lovers, they refused to let their sickness destroy it all. This was a different piece because there was no subtly. In my mind, most authors sugar coat everything and not tell you straight up, and that leaves you wondering."
2," have wanted to read this book for awhile now but always put it off. This is a hard topic for me to read/discuss. There is someone in my life close to me that has cancer. You can imagine the roller coaster of emotions I was on when I was reading this book.This book is a quick read, you get lost in the book and want to keep reading to find out what happens next. There are parts of the story that don't seem possible. This book is a work of fiction so not everything will be true to life.I found myself falling in love with Hazel and Augustus. They are just teenagers but facing something that no one should have to deal with let alone someone that age. I felt they handled things very maturely. I know personally I would not be able to.Like I said, I have someone close to me battling cancer. There are things in the book that Hazel and/or Augustus say or do that he has done, or I can see him doing.This book left me crying and emotional. I can't wait to see the movie now."
5," have been looking at this title on my kindle for months, and I just could not bring myself to read it because I knew it would rip my heart out. Alas I wanted to read it before watching the movie as the book is always better. So I decided I am not a person that sobs over books and though I may be saddened at the end I will read it anyway. This is the only book that I have read that brought actual tears to my eyes.I love Hazel and Augustus. They are smart and analytical. They are wonderful. Kids wiser than there years because life decided they needed to die. Cancer is a horrendous condition of the human experiment. I can not fathom losing a child or watching one of these diseases erode and defeat my loved one.It will leave you gutted and just like Hazel with Van Houton's book, I am wondering what the heck will happen to Hazel. How long will she live? Her time is finite but all of ours is. Will she live to love again? Fault in our Stars is absolutely epic. One that should not be missed."
5," WOW. That was amazing, like AMAZING.I need to check out this guys other books. If there filled with even half the emotion thats packed into this book they're bound to be great.Ugh. So much emotion.....And the characters.... Absolutely beautiful and heart breaking. but happy and sweet as well. what a wonderful combination.Its currently 4.03 Am I have slept. I couldn't put the book down. I had to read their story and read it now. I don't even know if this is coherent I'm that in Awe (and tired). I havent slept much over the last few days and i love sleep but it was worth the sacrifice to read this wonderful book.I am being purposely vague. because i except everyone to have already read this and understand my gushing, or have my gushing make you run out and buy this book A-SAP!There's a movie about this book right? going to be breath startlingly delightfully painful. I need to get me this movie.... and chocolate.I need some chocolate."
5," Although I felt as if this novel was missing something that I can't put my finger on, it was definitely moving. I can't wait to see the movie."
5," really loved the interaction between the characters, particularly Gus and Hazel.  A very realistic story about living and dying with cancer!"
4, Great book but sad. The story of young love and emotional ups and downs of life when your battling cancer. I read the entire book in 32 hours.
5, This book tells an interesting and non traditional love story. I found it to be both harbors and heart breaking at the same time. A must read!
5, loved this book!! I really recommend this book for 6th grade and up. I think John Green should write another book to see hoe Hazel is doing.
5, This book shows the idea of true love. It isn't sappy fake love. It is truthful to the real idea of love and that is what makes it so amazing.
5," Fantastic Young Adult book for ANYONE. I laughed, I cried, I fell in love with the characters. Cannot wait to read it again and see the movie."
2," A wonderful story of love. Beautifully written. I fell in love with these characters. Even though it was tragically sad, it was truly amazing."
5, This book was amazing . I thought it was amazing and I can't put it into words just read for yourself it will change your view on life forever
5," loved the book but it made me cry A LOT. Other than that it was really good, this is my first cancer book but I really enjoyed it."
5," found so much to love in this book. The characters are complex, and the subject matter is challenging. Not your typical girl meets boy book."
4," The Fault in Our Stars is a deep, thought-provoking, emotion-wrenching piece of literature. John Green totally appealed to my literary senses."
5, don't know whether to praise or curse John Green for this hauntingly beautiful and humorous yet painful and depressing literary masterpiece.
5," Very cute YA novel that still manages to provoke a mature response. Cried, laughed, smiled and lingered in my mind for days. Highly recommend."
5," So good, so sweet and hard, and sad, and lovely, and funny. So thoughtful and smart. Recommend to anybody. A real life, love, and death story."
5, read this book in less than a day and I can say it is beautiful... I cried like a bitch but it was amazing... you should definitely read it.
5, Completely heartwarming and genuine. Makes you appreciate the little things life has to offerI'll definitely be reading this book again.
2," Dialogue is witty, characters are instant heroes. I normally read thrillers, this was fast paced and had a lot of punches without being sappy."
5," This is the best book I've ever read. I cried at the end and didn't want it to end. I highly recommend this book, you won't regret reading it."
5,t's not often that I read a book that I loved as much as I loved this one. It's perfectly truthful and honest. I never wanted to put it down.
5," Simple and easy to read.  It deserves the attention it craves...including the scar on the soul it leaves.  It ends complete, but wanting more."
5," This was my first John Green read. I will absolutely look for more from him. Think literature and life, not cancer when considering this book."
5," This is my favorite book, but I warn you it will make you cry. I was sitting on my bed bawling and cursing the writer but it's an amazing book"
5," This is an amazing book which was taken care for as it should have been. Was packaged very well, and was in perfect condition when it arrived."
5," This is the first book by John Green that I've read and i was blown away, writing was superb and i will enjoy his other books i have no doubt."
5," don't know what others have said about this book, and I am sure I won't do it justice. It is first and foremost a love story, an unforgettable love story. My son gave me this book as a Mother's Day present. The most thoughtful thing he has ever done, and quite possibly the most thoughtful book I've ever read. Cancer, we all know about cancer. It afflicts the old and the young. We all have known someone who has died or is dying of this deadly disease, but unless you are living this journey, you have no idea what it means to live and even die with cancer. Why is this important? Because with every tribulation, twist and curve ball life throws us, and with every harrowing experience we survive, nothing teaches more about life as cancer. Nothing teaches you more than how to live when you know you are going to die. And from the unfettered and uncensored mindset of a teenage mind this book is raw, poignant and oh so brilliant. Thank you John Green for writing this book, because of you, I am a better a person."
5," had just finished reading one of the worst books I've ever read when I picked this one out next. So, I'm not sure if I love this book because, compared to the bag of crap I just finished, a textbook would be awesome, or if it's because The Fault in Our Stars is a phenomenal book. I'd say it's likely the latter.From the first chapter, I was hooked on this book. The characters are exactly the kind of people I'd have hung out with in high school. The writing is sharp and witty. The author's writing style is easy and flowing.There are certain expectations you have from the start of the book. I mean, you know what's going to happen. Only you realize a little further in, this isn't one of those kinds of books.I laughed ... A LOT. I learned a good deal. I fell in love with the characters. And I cried. I hate that this book is over, but am so glad I don't have to hunt Green down for a proper ending. I love this book &amp; hope to God that Hollywood doesn't ruin it with the film!"
2," My first interaction with this story was the movie and it grasped my interest so much, I just had to read the book. This book....I don't even know where to begin. Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters....while reading their story, I felt like I was loving with them, sharing their anger, their pain...and their limited time due to cancer. The story of their friendship turned love is so sweet and so real. You will cry...goodness will you cry reading this book but I don't see that as a bad thing.I have seen other reviews where they say the characters are unrealistic and the way Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters talk is not normal for teenagers. I call bullshit. These are kids who've had to grow up way too fast because of their health issues and they knew they probably don't have their whole lives to slowly enter adulthood. Not to mention there are plenty of young kids out there who have a bigger vocabulary and speak better than a lot of adults.I encourage anybody to read this fantastic book!"
5," John Green is such a genius.  I read it first having no idea this was young adult fiction.  To me, it was fiction for everyone.  I was so impressed that I taught it to my class of college freshmen.  I got mixed reviews.  Some of them called it the cancer book and others saw beyond the cancer book and realized the true meaning of John Green's message:  death is a reality of life.  We're all dying a little bit each day, but it's more obvious with some people.  And some people suffer more than others at an earlier age, but that doesn't mean they can't do ordinary things that other teenagers do like fall in love, travel, have good times with the person they love, meet people they idolize and then be bitterly disappointed, and of course, be scared and sad. The movie was excellent too and I highly recommend this book.  Unfortunately, when my class finished the book, our semester ended, and the movie came out about a week later, so we couldn't all go see it together.  What a disappointment!"
5," bought this book for my 14 year old niece and I was thrilled that she was so happy to get it because she had just seen the movie, I was also very proud that she wanted to read it in English, which is not her first language. So I bought and read it myself and really enjoyed it. It is hard, very moving and it is almost impossible to tear yourself away from the emotional ride once you embark on it.Even if the cultural references are sometimes a little random, I hope that many kids will look into some of the books and plays and poems that are mentioned in the book. The most revealing aspect of it was that these kids live in a kind of continuous exposure to death, being sick, being around other kids that are dying, playing video games of mass carnage and watching movies of (you guessed it) mass carnage. And that does not even include the current event news cycle. Not sure what to make of that. Not exactly what we had in mind for that generation when they were born, but I hope it makes them stronger."
5,"m sure with all the hype around every corner about this book that you've already decided to read this, and one review isn't going to change your mind. There isn't really a reason why you shouldn't read it. It's a pretty quick book to get through, and even if you dislike the characters, or the plot, you will still probably find at least one thing in it to ponder about. I personally feel that if a book makes you think, really think, then it's a pretty good book.I watched the movie first, when it came out in theatres. I happened to pick the book up at a garage sale, so I gave it a go. It is most definitely a sad book, I'll admit that it made my cry when I saw the movie, but knowing what happens kind of took the kick out of the book. It was still sad, but not overwhelmingly so.I still enjoyed the book though, and it had a little more substance to it than the movie did. I'm not really sure if I will read it again, but the one reading has given me a lot to think about nevertheless."
4," This was not the story line I expected and even though I wondered why I was still reading this, I couldn't put it down.  I did enjoy it......"
4," Loved this book so much, me and my 15 year old daughter read it together and then went and saw the movie, sad but Joh Green is a great writer"
3," everything one could ask for in a book: depth, love, clarity, charity.  need I say more.  Gave me such a strong outlook on what life is about"
5, just happened to pick up this book and finished it in three days. It's very inspiring. Let's you know to live everyday like it's your last.
5, LOVED this book!!! It was so amazing and so humbling! We get so consumed with things and our selfish desires we forget we simply need love.
5," This book touched a nerve in me, reminding me that Attitude is Everything. Like the characters in this book, I would love a sequel."
2," absolutely love this book. It's entertaining, comedic, and overall should be a book that everyone needs to read. I wish it would never end."
5,ve been looking for a page turner and I definitely found it! This book was so good and heart tugging. I think I cried for an hour straight.
5," Beautifully written story, ranks among the best books I've read. Very insightful in how cancer patients really feel- I know, I'm one of them."
5, This one is outstanding! I couldn't stop reading once I started. I hope the movie is well done because I hate it when the movie lets me down.
5," John Green wrote yet another great book to read. If you have not read his others, you will need to look into doing that as well. Great READ!!"
5,"ve read, tons of books. This book, is one of the best. I strongly suggest this book,IF you enjoy crying over fictional characters, as I do."
5, absolutely loved this book! I think John Green created brilliant characters that anyone can enjoy. I would recommend this book to everyone!
5, That book was just incredible. I think I'll read it again. I just feel like I learned so much from that book. Officially one of my favorites.
5," Beautiful words, Beautiful story. It might break your heart but read it anyway. Great for teens, parents and people who like excellent books."
5," Loved this book, very sweet storyline and makes you relate to the characters and sympathize with them. Can't wait to read more of John Green."
2," Amazing. A deeper understanding into love, pain, and us. We are the side effects of life and in the same sense life is the side effect of us."
5, At first I didn't want to read this story thinking that it would be sad. I found this story to be heartwarming and I'm so glad I did read it.
5, This book is rich with emotion and page turning relationships. The characters are well developed and draw the reader in as the story unfolds.
5, am a 15 year old girl and after finishing it this is now one of my favorite books. It is the perfect amount of romantic and tragically sad.
5," couldn't read it fast enough... Wow... he captures emotions in such a real way! I am now reading Saving Alaska, also written by John Green."
5, A very well written and poignant book that I would recommend for everyone to read. It touched me in so many ways that surpised me pleasantly.
5, make your own opinions.live your life.seize the day..fall in love.love some more.notice the universe.die.
5, THE BEST LOVE STORY ANYONE COULD READ! PERFECT BOOK FOR EVERYONE! Sad but so so good! I truly wish I had a LOVE story like Augustus and Hazel
5, PERFECT. This book is amazing. That's all that has to be said. I can't even explain my now adoration for this book. John Green is impeccable.
5," am 17 years old (on my Mom's account) and an avid book reader and never have I found a book as heartbreaking and as compelling as this one. John has been and will always be my favorite author &amp; hero. This book brought me on an unfathomable journey that made me laugh hysterically and cry so hard. There is no slow part to this book. Once the book begins it takes off. The imagery of the Amsterdam scenes was just brilliant and John Green describes the emotions so well, I began to feel them along side the main characters. This is the kind of book I will remember when I am 90. I will reccomend this to all of my friends. Although, the only part I did get a little frustrated on is how he ended the story like Peter ended his book. I want to know what happens to everyone!One caution: This book is IMPOSSIBLE to put down. I refused to put it down in school and kind of regretted it when I got to the sad part and began to cry in my yoga class."
2," Hazel is far from perfect; she is careless with her words and inflicts emotional damage on those she loves and who love her more than life itself. Gus is perhaps one of the most selfishly selfless characters ever written, and I treasure them both. Their story is one of true love and the pain of losing those we love, and the suffering we inflict on others upon our passing.I truly enjoyed the fact that the story did not end upon Gus' death; instead, it continued to highlight her high and low points of emotional devastation and her acceptance of the rise and fall of the tides of life.The story feels incomplete, yet I feel that it is perfect for the characters; Hazel lives, loves, and will die with her life having been incomplete, just as Gus did. The Fault in Our Stars is not my favorite book, but it is without a doubt one of the most relatable, yet impossible, love stories of my (admittedly minute) library and knowledge of respectable romance novels, and I look forward to reading it again."
5," taught high school English and drama for 42 years, often with very bright students, and not once in all that time did I come across any student who spoke like the two main characters in this novel.  The vocabulary, the philosophical  ideas, the literary references--all seemed way beyond their years. That was one major objection I had to the novel, the other was the character of the Dutch author, who I didn't believe for one second, especially when he shows up not once but twice at the end of the novel. His character was purely screenplay, in my opinion.Having said all that, I still very much enjoyed this book. Gus and Hazel seemed real to me, in spite of the way they talked. Their story and it's foregone tragic conclusion broke my heart. The dinner in Amsterdam was lovely, as was the tryst in Gus's hotel room. Meeting in the Literal Heart of Jesus was inspired. So many things Mr. Green did right...and only a few wrong ones...again, in my opinion. I would strongly recommend this book."
5," knew it would be a tear jerker--and of course it was. But I still felt a hopefullness throughout the book that suggested life can be sad and uncertain, but it is, most importantly, to be LIVED.  I've heard so many people say that they won't read this because they can't put themselves through what it sure to be a hard topic to read. But I would say to them, this book is real, refreshing, and I was happy for all of the sick characters involved who lived their lives in spite of their sicknesses. I was sad for them too, but mostly I felt proud of them and so excited they were able to be happy.Three sentences in I realized this was not some flash in the pan young adult author, but a very talented John Green with incredibly readable prose. I was personally thrilled with the Shakespeare, Fitzgerald, Eliot, Ginsberg, Twain and more literary references. I will read anything and everything, so picking up this gem after Divergent (not that I hated it, but it was poorly written) was refreshing!"
4," TFIOS reads like the Tumbr diary of a girl with cancer. It is definitely a book for young adults, while definitely being a book written by a man in his mid-thirties. I really like the overall plot, and the sadder scenes are gracefully written and sometimes beautiful, but many things in the book just annoyed me, felt unrealistic and made me dislike the characters. Augustus's cigarette non-smoking seemed kind of stupid to me. I found it hard to like Hazel after she made a distinction between boy movies and girl movies - she might be headstrong, but she is not a strong female character. I also felt that, aside from the exceptional circumstances, there was nothing really exceptional about Hazel and Gus's relationship. It did seem like puppy love to me. I didn't mind TFIOS and I don't actively dislike it, but I don't understand the hype around it. But, hey, the paperback is like $8 on here with Prime shipping, so at most you have $8 and a few hours to lose by reading it."
5," Have you ever read that one book that just got you THINKING? That one book you can't put down, that book that immediately becomes your favorite upon reading? TFIOS was that book for me. TFIOS was the book that put me on a quest to read any and all John Green novels I could get on my hands. I started Looking for Alaska, I'm already halfway done.TFIOS was relate able to me, like I'm sure it was to a lot of other readers. With my mother (the owner of the account from which I am writing this review) in the midst of her battle against non small cell lung cancer (a nonsmoker's cancer) I felt Hazel's understanding of life and death was helpful to my understanding of my mom's battle. depression is not a side effect of cancer. Depression is a side effect of dying never have I read a novel, in all my 16 years of loving to read amazing novels, have I read a piece of art in which such a hard hitting quote can be found on the first page of chapter one.Thank you, John Green. I love you."
3," purchased this book after reading the raving reviews. People gushed about the touching story and promised a good cry. I literally had to force this book down because I was hoping beyond hope that this little girl with a terrible attitude, and serious lack of tact, would find some sort of depth or have an inspirational ah-ha moment....spoiler; she doesn't. No character ever evolves or goes anywhere. Every character is generally the same person, and none of them are anywhere near lovable.When I finished this book, I stared at the last page thinking, Really?. I couldn't stop staring at it feeling sad only because I was sorry that I stayed up late exchanging precious sleep for this shallow, lackluster book. How and Why does this book have so many raving reviews? Surely there can't be that many people out there who enjoy this false sense of depth laced with terrible language.... Everyone in this book cussed like they were raised by sailors, and yet I'm lead to believe they're intelligent? I wasted my six dollars and time and now I'm wasting space in my house because I simply can't bring myself to put this book back into circulation. I will keep it in my closet in the far corners where no one will ever have to come acrossed it and ask, What's this?. I will say this, the writer himself is promising. He has a way of creating an environment that you believe will turn into something amazing or incredible. If he just finds other words to use besides a sailors dialogue and finds a way to evolve a character into something more than his own reflection, he could be an author worthy of praise."
5, An incredible book. I expected the girl to die but she doesn't. (That's enough of a hint.) The trip to Holland was great. The Amazing Reader
1," Fits the criteria of a great summer read...sweet, touching, and human.  Highly recommended to 14 and older.  Looking forward to the next one"
5, The fault in our stars was great!  I couldn't stop reading it once I started. Thank you John Green for taking me on this journey. Thank you!
5," Beautiful story. Wonderfully written. Great read. Looking forward to the movie release this summer. Very touching, true, sad, and inspiring."
2," While the subject is quite heavy but sometimes uplifting,  the writing is extraordinary, Great reading for the intellectual and/or ponderer."
5, read the book in one day because I couldn't put it down. It made me both laugh and cry numerous times. I would highly recommend this book!
5, My daughter couldn't put the book down. She even cried and she isn't a crier.  The book arrived as promised and in new condition.  Loved it.
5," This is hands down the best book I've ever read: beautifully written, hilarious, tragic. I won't soon forget the story of hazel and Augustus"
5," This is a very well written novel that keeps you interested and invested In the lives of the characters. I definitely cried, more than once."
5," Even though this book is considered to be Young Adult, it is a sophisticated, beautiful story.  I have recommended it to a number of people."
5," This is a beautifully written piece of literature that will lift your heart while at the same time tear at your soul.  Well done, Mr. Green."
5," This book made me laugh, cry, and ponder about life. It truly is a good book, and I would definitely recommend reading it. 5 stars for sure."
5, can't even begin to describe the emotional rollercoaster the reader experiences while reading this book.  This is a must read by everyone!
5, never wanted to put the book down. It's such a good read!! The author brings out emotions that make you feel like you're part of the book.
2, This book was everything a book should be and more! I highly recommend it to men and women alike. It honestly blew me away to say the least.
5," This book gave me a new perspective on life. I laughed just as hard as I cried...which was a lot. Seriously, so inspiring and not too heavy."
5," Truly. Amazing. I was laughing one minute then crying the next. I felt connected to hazel grace and Augustus. John Green, you. Did. Amazing."
5, This was my first Kindle download! It was a super easy and super quick process for the technically challenged. It downloaded within minutes.
5," can say that it was a pretty good book, realistic, and it make me cry a lot, like they say some times we found love in a hopeless place .."
5, really enjoyed this book even though it made me teary eyed at times.  I am glad that love was found  and sad that cancer destroys so much.
5, This book captures the all the concepts of life on every page. Passion. Humor. Love. Capital-E Everything. This book is Capital-S Something.
5," finished this page turning book in two days. I was absolutely captivated by the raw human emotion. We all remember our first loves, the fall, the fear, the excitement, and most of all the ending. The characters in this brilliant book took on a life for me. Each of them captured a piece of my heart. Especially Hazel Graces' mom. As a mother, the part about that she would no longer be a mom when she died and the reconcile when she blew up to the point her mom knew she heard really got me. To the point I prayed my new Kindle was water proof. It is the greatest fear of a parent to lose a child and an insufferable nightmare for those unfortunate parents who have. At one point my youngest was circling the drain. All you feel is numbing ache and in that moment there isn't anything you would do or give to ease one single moment of their existence. This book was beautifully written with every emotion captivated within its carefully chosen words, insight, and haunting realities of the human condition."
5," This book was recommended to me by my 15 year old daughter, took me a few months to finally buy it on Kindle. I was hesitant because she said I would cry, Really? I was not ready for an emo book even without any details (she is a firm believer of not giving ANYTHING away  when it comes to books or movies). As Augustus mentioned it was a roller coaster ride and it's all up, awesome! The battle to beat an invisible beast is brutal and it takes a brave human to keep a humorous outlook. But the deep and brilliant parts of a soul to be unleashed in such a way as to make us other mere humans understand on paper is amazing. Thought processors working through my large yet inadequate brain refuses to let me put on paper what  I mean to write, it just gets jumbled and I ramble. See?  As cancer seeks to live, by killing our puny seeming vessels in its wake we can chose to pass on our knowledge so the next in this rotation has a chance of handling it better and making it more bearable despite the outcome."
5," Who would've thought a story about star-crossed teens battling terminal cancer could be such an engaging, not to mention uplifting read? But that is what John Green manages in this lovely novel.His protagonist, 16-year old Hazel Grace Lancaster, who suffers from thyroid cancer, and her love interest, 17 year-old Augustus Waters (an amputee to osteosarcoma) are surely two of the most precocious, appealing, and believable teens to populate fiction in ages. Their wise-beyond-years, and often very funny conversations, keep the novel from slipping into saccharine/maudlin territory--which isn't to say that the novel doesn't strum the reader's emotions. It does. In fact, I recommend keeping a box of Kleenex handy.Green's memorable novel deals with the very human struggle to accept the reality of death; but more to the point, it addresses how important it is to accept -- and make the most of -- whatever life presents.  Even when the hand we're dealt isn't pleasant.  Or fair."
2," Was I crying like a freaking baby? Oh, yes. But to be honest, there are some stuff that kind of bothers me a bit, like THE ENDING (it's romantic and heartbreakingly beautiful, but seriously, I need more), so that's why it holds me from giving this book five stars.I'm a heavy-angst-romance type of bookworm. I love to read heart-wrenching love story where the Hero and heroine circled each other then made love. This book, is a young adult, the 'mainstream' one, so that's why it took me forever to read it though I already purchased it like a year ago.Beautiful book with even more beautiful words. Augustus was one hell of a guy. Hazel too. I adore both of them. But somehow I pictured them as matured folks instead of young-ins and that's weird because they're high-schoolers yet sounds so old. Understandable though, after all they've been through.So overall, I liked it though I'm bot exactly that satisfied. I need a better closure. But then again, I enjoyed it."
4," This novel might just be the epitome of love stories. Never a dull page and I just wanted to keep reading, and I'm most definitely not the reading type. Every sentence down to an explanation of Hazel living a s***ty life and every sentence spoken by the drunken author, had depth meaning. I recommend this book to virtually anyone. It is so heartfelt yet appropriate to a large range of ages and interests. It has what seems like a perfect balance between seriousness and comedy. The character development could be described as phenomenal. I fell in love with Augustus from the first lustrous description. This book is an outstanding must read. Although it just an overall heartwarming story of young love and challenges I feel that the crucial message the author to across perfectly was the importance of family and friends and the essential general significance of living your life to the fullest. It teaches us to appreciate the ones that care for us in our darkest times. Overall an amazing must read"
4," This is a very fast and nourishing read for anyone, young or old. I don't read a lot of YA fiction, but it so happens my last two reads were of this genre.The first thing that struck me was how the author made a great effort to keep this romance sweet and real, without doing a fake-y scrub on the language and content. Teens curse, think about sex, drink, and sometimes smoke. Parents...pretending these things don't exist is NOT doing your kid any favors. You should instead hope they learn about these parts of life with your guidance instead of behind your back. I digress...I actually appreciated the way these topics were approached in this novel.And this is a novel suitable for both teens and their parents. You will cry and be moved;  You will be able to feel the way these kids and their families feel. Four plus stars...reluctantly no five as it was still slightly too predictable. Not everyone gets to live through a cancer story most times, and this is no exception."
5," can't even put into words just how incredible this is. I LITERALLY cannot. This is just so.... I don't quite understand how to breathe or live or function anymore. I don't know if these are tears, or my SOUL POURING FROM MY EYES. Can one even LIVE properly after reading something so beautiful, amazing, and heart-breaking? Honestly, there really aren't any words I can put together to share with you the beauty and impact of this book. No matter how hard I try. I just can't. All I can do is cry and hope that people will take away from this book, not that it was just a good book they were glad to stumble upon, but take away the, I don't quite know how to phrase it, really, the outlook on the the way things are. How things have to be. How things can't be, no matter how hard you wish for them. And, just how things are. To some, it may seem depressing or sappy, but I say that it's just.... well.... the only way to know how amazing this is, is to read it yourself. You will NOT regret it.Okay?"
4, This book was'nt easy for me to read. I too have had a love one die of cancer. They loved a lot in the short time they had with each other.
5," Haven't seen the movie but enjoyed the book. Well-written, especially the dialogue between the main characters. Witty but not over the top."
5, really enjoyed the book. Didn't think the book would end the same way as An Imperial Affliction. Would still recommend it to read though!
4, The author captured the young love of two people that helped guide them through unimaginable circumstances... I can't wait to see the movie
4, am clueless as to what to leave for a review.......but just know this......I want to go right back to the beginning and read it again!!!!
5, This book will blow u away and is beautifully written. I think that this book is the most amazing book I have  ever read!!!!!!!!!  READ IT!
2, This book is on par with Flowers for Algernon as the most emotional book I've ever read. I'd highly recommend it if you want to feel again.
5, loved the element of the story within the story.  The ramifications to the families of adolescents with cancer was also beautifully told.
5, This was an amazingly inspiring book. Great read! The author did an amazing job with the characters. I would recommend this book to anyone.
5, A wonderful book. Both my high school daughter and I loved it and have read it more than once. Highly recommend for older teens and adults.
5," This book is amazing.  It's so heartfelt,  I cried.  They don't talk like regular teenagers,  but that's because they aren't regular teens."
5, Keep tissues nearby while reading and prepare for the ugly cry. You are not crazy for laughing and crying within seconds of each emotion.
5," Awesome book!!!! , I cried the last 50 pages . I'm in love with Augustus Waters . I have to say that my heart is broken after finishing it."
5," Touching, moving, emotional, and funny. I really enjoyed this book and it was a fast read. Definitely read it with a box of Kleenex nearby."
5," haven't been an avid reader in quite awhile, but this one right here, this book, makes me want to find the gems out there. It's gleaming."
5," One of the best books I've read, wonderful characters, beautiful story, elegantly written. It's given me pause to stop and smell the roses."
2, The characterization in this book was phenomenal. Ended up crying my eyes out by the end. Definitely a must read--especially for teenagers.
5, What an incredible writer. Awesome story. I couldn't put this book down. Fast reading and entertaining. I would highly recommend this book.
5," Awesome and joy come to mind after reading this book, I recommend this book to all who love reading and to all that like a good love story."
5, This book has touched me in a way I never knew words could. Absolutely beautiful characters make you think of the world in a whole new way.
5," absolutely loved this book. I laughed, I cried, and I can't stop recommending it to everyone I know. I now want to read all of his books."
5, would recommend this to someone who likes a twist and enjoys a long read. If you like John Green other books you'll simply love this one.
5," A page turner - very captivating writing.  I read it in one sitting - very interesting, but a bit too depressing for my own personal taste."
5," No word in this world would describe how perfect this book is.I didnt think I'd like to read this book, but it's my favorite one now."
5, great mix between depessing and romantic. will recomend for all ages. and try not to cry your eyes out. john green is truly a gifted writer
5,"m going to be quoting this book for a long, long time. This infinity is long than other infinities, and I'm going to notice the universe."
2, Some infinities are larger than others and lots of people are looking through windows of this crappy disease and finding humongous lunkers.
5," Very moving, beautifully written story.  Couldn't put it down, would highly recommend it, requires several tissues!  Finished it in 2 days!"
5,ve read this book four times as it truly is wonderful. Such an easy read yet so insightful. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone.
5," was expecting a lot from this book, what with it's high rating and all, and I got what I expected and more.  Definitely worth picking up."
5," great writing and excellent character development. The author really channeled the voice of a 17 year old girl, which I thought was amazing"
5," touching, realistic fiction - could not put it down.  Might be a little intense for younger teens, but recommend to older teens and adults."
5, This is honestly the best book I have ever read.  I am so inspired now and I have hope about my own life that I never thought to have back.
5," read it all at once...the writing is beautiful and the writing within the writing is beautiful. I wished I could read An Imperial Affliction, but then I thought maybe I was. At one point I was convinced this book would stop mid sentence. The characters are interesting in that they are both young and old at the same time, they possess a maturity that I suppose is a result of coming to terms with your mortality, but they are still teenagers - rash decision makers, tantrum throwers and true love believers. I reached the end without knowing it was the end. I suppose I could have followed the lives of the characters forever...just to see how it plays out...The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that it was a little fairy tale for me. A little too perfect, sort of romantic comedy feel at one point. But that is no fault of the story or the writer, simply a personal taste issue. Also I suppose it was pretty predictable, but I suppose, in the end, all stories are predictable."
5," am a fan of authors who create characters with wit and sarcasm (and happen to be a bit on the strange side).  The Fault In Our Stars was a raw tale of love, loss, tragedy, and strength.  While I've read stories that engaged me more with the characters, I liked how it focused primarily on two characters and engaged me mostly with Hazel.  She's the narrator, the bias, and the creator in this story.  Much of what is described is from an ill teenager's bias, rather than from what we would normally notice or expect from a normal character's perspective.  This book is hilarious, tragic, and sarcastic and will keep you enthralled if it is your cup of tea. (Possibly even if it isn't!)  The side characters, such as the mother and father, didn't become as well developed to me.  This I felt was a good thing.  It showed that the book wasn't about those characters.  The two most developed characters in the story are tragically intertwined and the story develops around them as they twist the plot."
5," hate reviews that come on years behind when a book has made its mark on the world, showering us with spewing praise over a novel that is already beloved. Still, I cannot help but add my own to the spray this time. John Green has written a book that speaks volumes on the subject of illness and to people who have experienced loss and death and grief. I equally loved and loathed this book for the same reasons. There is no greater pain than losing someone you love, of worrying that those left behind will not know the value of their life or the quirky parts of them that made them so special to you. John Green made this visible in this novel, and my loathing is only in that he reminded me of those very concerns for the person I loved and lost. My admiration of him will continue with equal fervor, even if-like the character van Houghton- he never pens another worthy line. If you are not plagued by this sort of pain and grief, read this wonderfully poignant novel. If you are, read it twice."
2," generally tend to avoid cancer books (because, seriously, who is fond of weeping while reading?!). Yet, I saw how popular this novel was, and without actually reading any reviews or plot summaries, I just dove in with practically no preconceived notions. And naturally, at the initial mention of the C word on page one, I let out an audible sigh. I wasn't mentally prepared to read that kind of book, but words cannot express how grateful I am that I did.Green has created characters who exist beyond the mere pages of his book, and they stay with you long after the novel has ended. Hazel Grace and Augustus are truly genuine in speech, thought, and manner. Each character Green introduces to us has a life and a passion and a view of their own. Everything about the plot is credible and essential to depicting these lives that are centered on uncertainly and unremitting love.This novel possesses the ability to change your view of life. Just read it."
5," Read though this book in one day over about 5 hours total. Its that type of book; you'll start it and won't stop until the last page is turned.Obviously a cancer book, which carries a lot of weight when describing young adolescents who were supposed to have their entire lives ahead of them, instead living with this terrible disease.Not all doom and gloom though. These kids are witty and truly funny, mostly the reason I couldn't put the book down. Gus came across a little too much as the perfect Prince Charming instead of a typical teenager despite the author trying to portray as one from his film and book choices, but the book is about Hazel, whose initially trying to alienate herself and goes through a transformation instead. Nice character development there.Trying to avoid the plot spoilers here, but seems like the story wasn't completely original. As my title says, very many parallels in the end to My Girl.Great read, recommended."
5,"t was a good portrayal of people living with their illness, living their life out the best they can. Important message for young and old."
4," This is an amazing book.  Lots of humor, pathos and good writing.  I really enjoyed it. Even my 13 year old grandson read it and loved it."
4,f you don't read to cry then I would still highly suggest you read this...it's AMAZING!!!! Yes you will cry and scream but it's worth it.
5, Super.  The.  Best.  Book. Ever.  Omg.So. Good.  :)  Loved it. Front to back.  5 stars.Must.  Read yourself.  Seriously.
5, This book was everything that I expected and more! Truly inspiring and unique love story. John Green is definitely a one of a kind author.
5, No words can describe the emotion in this story... It shows how cancer diagnosed patients still can live their lives... It's just perfect!
5," This is a book with a beautiful message. I'm not a frequent reader, but I couldn't put the book down. Readers beware: I cried my eyes out!"
5, This book is about teenage love but with a twist: cancer  what inspiring characters for everyone to meet I would read this again and again
2," This is a great story. It's full of humor, sadness and tragedy. I fell in love with Hazel Grace and Gus. I could hardly put the book down."
5, To me it was a very quick read. Couldn't stop once i started. Lovely story and well written. Looking forward to more books from John Green
5,"t was such a quotable, honest, no lies book. I admire that thoughtful writing that changes you forever! I could read it again and again!!"
5," amazing. really sad but one of those books you'll always remember, no matter what. inspirational and one of the best books I've ever read."
5, have never read a book that is so horribly wonderful. I wish that I could personally thank John Green for creating such an amazing book.
5," Magnificent and moving, a book you just can't put down nor ever forget. You simply need to share it with those who know how to love books."
5, Read it because the movie is coming out soon.  Very similar to a Nicholas Sparks book.  I was expecting a little more due to all the hype.
5," John green wrote tous book in thé mots crever possible watt, in lifting parts to make you laugh, and parts to make you bawl your eyes out."
3," This book is incredibly sad, but very well written.  I feel like I knew each character and was right there with them.  A great love story."
5, laughed at some parts extremely hard and others times I cried. It's a page turner and I promise you'll love it.-Nerdfighter female
2, This book was really great. The story is heart-wrenching and the characters are so loveable. It is definitely worth reading at least once.
5,"t was awesome. Practically perfect in every way.  Everyone should read this book.  This app requires me to write more, but I said it all."
5," LOVE THIS BOOK WHICH MADE ME SMILE, CRY AND IT TAUGHT ME TO CARE MORE FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE CANCER. I love John Green and his books. DFTBA"
5," recommended by a friend, I read it on one leg of a flight and a few evenings before bed.  Quick read but very poignent...highly recommend."
5, was looking for something different to read.  I selected this book based on reviews.  I was not disappointed.  This was an awesome book.
5," know it wasn't written in 2013, but this is BY FAR going to be my favorite read of 2013. I'm no sure how anything else could come close."
5," Not an easy read, but worth it. Great character development and the issues were poignant. Dealt with survival and life while facing death."
5, Beautiful love story! This is on  of those books that once  you read it becomes a part of you. Treasure every day as if it were you  last.
5," was captivated by the voice of the main character.  It sounded very real to me.  Sad as the story was, it still managed to be uplifting."
5," My teenages love this book and even used it for school projects. Easy ordering, fast shipment, sent just as described. What a hit! Thanks!"
2," A wonderful book about life, death, and love. Enjoyed every page.definitely recommend it any young adult and young adult fiction fan"
5," don't like writing reviews that essentially re-tell the whole story, like many reader reviews are written on eBooks. As a reader, I just want to know if it is going to be a great story, a semi-good story, or probably not the authors best work, and why I might feel the way the reviewer feels. (I never call any piece of art bad as beauty is truly in the eye of the beholder.) So, with that being said, I feel this book is well-written, and it features very, very likable characters. It is what I consider a good read because the author captured so many emotions throughout the story. There is humor, anger, fear, doubt, angst, sorrow, and love. I recommend this book even though I would like the author to answer a few questions for me:What becomes of Hazel Grace?What becomes of her parents once she is gone?And...by chance do Hazel Grace and Augustus reunite whenReaders will understand those last 3 questions and why I ended my review the way I did."
5," John Green makes his characters come alive, even when they are dying. Green works his magic and draws you in from the very beginning, introducing people who could be your neighbour, your brother, your daughter, or simply your friend. They are flesh and blood and guts and tears, and so easy to like that you cannot stop it from growing into your very own clumsy, awkward and oh, so young, love story all of your own. You slowly but surely become part of the book, ending up just as lost and bewildered as the young characters in Green's so very, very sad story. Speaking of sad. The only reason I couldn't allow myself to fall too hard for Green this time, in spite of all the excellently delivered and witty words of wisdom, is that the sadness of it all sort of crippled my natural enthusiasm and brought me to tears so frequently that in the end I was simply too exhausted to thoroughly enjoy the reading experience. Still, I assume that tells you more about me, than it does about the book."
5," First and foremost, I'd like to say that John Green didn't write just another cancer book. THE FAULT IN OUR STARS is so much more than that, because Hazel and Augustus (the two main characters) are more than just two kids with cancer.THE FAULT IN OUR STARS was simply beautiful. I don't often use that word to describe a book, but after reading the final sentences, I couldn't think of a better word to describe it. John Green has written something special—a story that feels absolutely true, that strikes you with the beauty and honesty of the prose, that will make you laugh and cry and leave you feeling like you experienced Hazel's story yourself. Like her memories are really yours.I can't recommend this book enough. It instantly became one of my favorites, and it's one I'm sure I'll re-read in the future.THE FAULT IN OUR STARS more than deserves its long run on the New York Times bestseller list. John Green has written something truly spectacular."
3," *Spoiler Alert*This isn't normally my kind of story but I decided to give it a try anyways. I found it to be both funny and moving. Tragic  but beautiful. Some people didn't like the intellectual conversations between Hazel and Gus, saying that they were unrealistic. No, teenagers don't talk like that, but it's fiction so I'm okay with it.That being said, there were a few things that did not appeal to me. I found the characters to be somewhat inconsistent. Not a lot but just enough to notice. There were  sometimes that they all seemed like the same character.The romance and physical descriptions were bland at best. I mustered up a connection to each character but I just wasn't convinced that they were in love.Lastly, There were a number of times when Hazel sounded like a man instead of a teenage girl. John Green has been added to the long list of male authors who don't understand women/girls well enough to write them accurately."
5,"t's been many years since I stayed up until the wee hours to finish a book...but I simply couldn't put down this book until the final words were read. My daughter turned me onto TFIOS. She'd bugged me about reading it but I'd procrastinated for the reason you would think a parent doesn't want to read a book like TFIOS but with the trailers for the movie now out I finally broke down. I was not disappointed by much.How JG gets what being a 16 yo girl is about is uncannny. He gets it. The parents. The boyfriend. The love. The pain.So why not 5 stars?? In truth...I debated. The book is great. I laughed and cried and nodded in remembrance of the emotions Hazel showed us in every page. But I don't know that it is expressed as a 16 girl would express it. Hazel is so grown up and maybe a girl that has gone through what she has would be this grown up. The same with Gus. They just seemed like these two absolutely perfect people. And at 16, we are not perfect."
3, tear jerker awesome book will probably read it again. John Green is an amazing author I haven't been disappointed with anything from him.
4, Really got involved with the characters and started to wish for the best.  There is a book within a book and it does leave you wondering.
5, Couldn't put this book down. Excellent love story!  Everyone should feel th lov t hat is written in this book. Highly recommend this book
5," As an adult, this book was an easy read.  I couldn't get into the storyline too much, though, because it is geared more toward teenagers."
2, love this book I cried and it touched my heart it is a mastermind my eyes are watering just thinking about it im in love with this book
3, Depressing. Predictable ending. Easy read and maybe offers some insight into teens with terminal illness but overall it is disappointing.
5, have no words for how good this book was. The ending was sad but it was a great ending . Even though gus died he lived on in her heart.
3," The night I finished this book, I ugly cried.  There are no heroes or villains, just humans.  Flawed, sad, humans just trying their best."
5,"t was a romantic love story of two sick teens fighting for their life.5 out if 5 starsIt was tear-dropping, fun, and loving."
5, This is an amazing book ever. A good young love book with an amazing moral and theme about a kid fighting cancer very sweet and touching.
5," Couldn't put it down! I laughed, I cried, yadda yadda yadda. Wonderful story, fascinating narrator. Everyone should give this book a try!"
5, What an amazing story. Sad. Tear jerked. Two amazingly intelligent teens going through a horrible situation. Poor Gus! Loved Hazel Grace!
5, this book is so worth reading.I read this in one night! The book caught me right away.The twist at the end was really good...
5," This book had me hooked! It's so well written and moving, and so funny! It also is a great insight into one cancer patient's perspective."
2," Beautifully written, it made me laught, it made me cry and this is a book that every parent could relate to and empathise and rejoice in."
5, loved this book sooo much. All of the thoughts the author brought to mind made me think about life differently. I couldn't put it down.
5, This book was extremely real and amazing. The tears which flowed from my eyes weren't even as real and the story. Breathtakingly amazing.
5, love this book. I reread twice just to catch all the nuances in the characters. I would highly recommend this book. Be prepared to cry!
5, sobbed my way through this entire book. Everything ways so good. So perfect. I can't describe my  love for this book and for John green
5, Thank you John green. Your book made me feel. And it feels wonderful. Though I would like to know what happens to Hazel Grace and others.
5," could not put this down!  I laughed, cried, and felt every emotion possible while reading.  I highly recommend this book to any reader."
5," This book is amazing, for once take notice of the ratings and ravings that are painfully cheesy without dismissing them and read the book"
5," Teens enjoy the book and suggest it to friends. Seems to be a favorite with the boys, especially, which are a little difficult to locate."
5," This is a lovely story of teenage friendship and the adults in their lives. That the kids have cancer is operant, but not the whole story"
2," Great book, couldn't put it down. Colorful language, interesting plot, couldn't have asked for a better read. Well done Green, well done."
5," This book is amazing! It makes you smile, laugh, and cry in such a short period of time. It's definitely a heart-felt story. A MUST read!"
5," This book was incredible! I would recommend it to any teen/ young adult. It's a serious tear jerker, though so be prepared to cry rivers."
5, Good story enjoyed this book....was different than my normal reads but well worth the time.......recommended for sure to anyone. Amazing.
5, This is a life changing book! You really must read it! It is so well written and make you feel so many emotions. You will love this book.
5," He has his teenage protagonists make all the right witty one liners over and over.  In that sense it is good and clever.  He has one great one-liner after the next.It has to be unimaginably horrible to be in that situation.  My one-star knock against the book is that it has this sense of being contrived.  Maybe that is because its target audience is teenagers, and I am in my late 30s.  Maybe John Green understands how it is contrived, and maybe he feels like he is exploiting the situation a little bit and this is why he has a character in the book who writes a book about cancer who is an a*#&amp;%$^@.I am going back to medical school and I may end up in pediatrics so I decided to check out this book (even though it really seems to be marketed towards women).  I think it probably definitely helps putting you in the perspective of a person who is not only suffering from cancer at a young age but someone whose entire social circle is also in the same predicament."
5," am a teen and, like most typical teens, I hate reading. But, I heard about how great this book was. I tried it out. Read it instantly; loved it so much. This book brought tears to my eyes. This sounds cheasy, but I've never felt this close to a book.The characters' personalities are easily described. Every person had their own personality - which is a big successful part of a story.There is one thing about this story though. (Kinda, not much of a spoiler-) Hazel and Augustus never got into any arguments or fights. Every relationship always has their little arguments. Not this one. Their love story needed to be a bit more realistic. But I still loved it.I'm so thrilled to have read this. So many teens have been reading this, it's highly popular. I'm so glad I didn't miss out.Also, this book is realistic in most ways, many people these days struggle with cancer.. There's no such thing as perfect-And this book has clearly displayed that."
4," : I am not sure what to say or how to say just how much I loved this book.The story is about a 16 year old girl who is more or less forced by her parents to join a cancer support group in a basement of a church. There she meets a boy, Augustus Waters. Augustus Waters is just perfect.  With his side “fake smoking” cigarette and his everything that makes him appealing.Characters: The characters were perfect.  I loved them all.Positives: I finished this book at 1:30am.  I was sobbing.  It was breathtaking love story.  It was touching and beautiful and yes sad, but one that will stay with me for a very long time.  I thought about these characters first thing when I woke up the next morning after I finished the book.Negatives:  Nothing. Maybe I would have liked an epilogue.  I am not sure. I just know I loved this book. From beginning to end. I laughed, I cried, I sighed. Loved.Bottom line:  Cannot wait for the movie."
5," “Sometimes, you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book.”It's as if John Green knew his book would be a clear hit.What can I really say about this book that hasn't already been stated. The story of Hazel and Augustus with their respective health problems is incredible. Their travels to Denmark are inspiring. In my opinion, they show anyone can enjoy life, regardless of what terrible circumstances you're living under. I don't think I'll ever be able to forget the joy they felt while visiting the harrowing Anne Frank house.All good things must come to an end, right? Right. Tears will fall from all readers who take the plunge and decide to read this brilliant book. As painful as it is, it's also enjoyable and incredibly well written. John Green speaks to his readers in a phenomenal way"
5," As a writer, it's been at least a few years since I read a book that made me forget I was reading! Most books, I'm preoccupied with how the author did this or that, his/her writing style, and how the story is just okay, not wonderful, but pretty good. With this book, I kept trying to pin down how John Green wrote the way he did -- how did he describe things so well? how did he write such great dialogue? -- but every time I failed because I was so drawn into the story that I'd forget I was supposed to be analyzing his style. I love having this problem! The story is sad, funny, engaging, romantic (but not in a sappy way), and poignant all at the same time. I loved the characters, even the minor ones like Patrick the social worker in the Literal Heart of Jesus Church! This book is supposed to be for young adults, but I'm an adult and I loved it! I would recommend it for anyone of any age who reads to get insights into life and who likes great dialogue. Perfect!!"
2," Through the first half of this book, I found myself highlighting and re-reading portions that jumped out and sent such emotion that I thought it would become my new favorite book. I instantly fell in love with Hazel. Her attitude and outlook on things was sarcastic but so utterly truthful. I just love a book where the wit and hilarity can become an inside joke between friends who have read the book as well.Unfortunately, in the last half of the book, I thought it became a little overdone. There were several instances when I didn't believe what was happening. A few scenes didn't seem to further the story...more like filler than forward moving action. At times, it felt like things were being tied up to quickly yet when I turned the page on the last chapter the story still felt undone.I am left with mixed emotions about this book. I did enjoy the story and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys finding humor in situations that are not so humorous."
5, Hard to finish a book with tears in your eyes. Wonderfully written story of love and life. Recommended read  full of insight into living
4," A classic cancer love story that people will love throughout history! Hazel and Gus, forever in our hearts❤️~Victoria Cadena"

5, really enjoyed this book even thought the subject matter was hard. Well written and researched. You really cared about the characters.
5, Very sad. Sad enough to make it feel like my heart was tore into a million pieces. But it was very good and I look forward to the movie.
4," think, for me that it's important to try and see the world in as many ways as possible. This book opened up another one of those ways."
5, Outstanding book who's author introduces humour in the darkest of situations. Such a realistic love story with an unbelievable twist. ❤️
2, This was a great book and easy to read.  Arrived quickly and I started reading immediately.  Recommend to anyone looking for a good book

5, One of the best books I've read in a long time. The book was both hilarious and emotional. I will definitely read more John Green books.
5," absolutely adored this book. I couldn't put it down. I don't want to leave any spoilers, but you will need tissues while reading this."
5, Thoroughly enjoyed this book from beginning to end. could not put it down. I highly recommend this book. you will not regret reading it.
5, That boy really has some sweet one liners - you are so busy being you that you have no idea how utterly unprecedented you are.
5," Love everything about it! It takes me back to young love and finding a new love, I am not finished--but I really don't want it to end!!!"

5," This book touched my heart. Fabulous read! I recommend for any teenager or adult. Despite shortness, the book speaks a powerful message."
5, Amazing!!!! I started it on a Friday and finished it on Saturday night! I was told to read it by one of my students and they were right!
5, John green is something else. This book was so beautiful and definitely a book I would read again. By far the best John green books yet.
5, love this book! i've read it twice and I can't get enough! It's such a sweetromance and I the characters are amazing! 5 stars!!!
5, Probably the most beautiful book I've every read!  Touching journey of two kids trying to face something kids should never ahve to face.
5, Great read. Definitely recommend to younger generation and people of all ages. Interesting story and insightful. Known as a tear jerker.
5," will preface this by saying that I have a 2 y.o. daughter and the transference issues that came up during this book may have clouded my judgement a bit.  This book was very highly reviewed on Amazon and others who have read it.  However, I just didn't...get there.  I did find that Green did a good job getting into the mind of a teenage girl.  I saw the twist of Gus getting sick coming.  I understood, and appreciated, the sick scenes being told in one long thought - I felt it was accurate, less drawn-out, and just the way a teenage girl would explain what was happening.  But, the real meat of the story...meh.  I wasn't feeling it.  I found some parts of the story to be somewhat inauthentic and some of the scenes between Hazel and Gus a bit trite.  And the part with the author of Imperial Affliction, Van Houten - just plain silly.  I feel this book would resonate much more with teenagers, which I imagine is why this book is YA, but not so for me."
5," One of the books I have read this year that I think is a great book is the Fault In Our Stars written by John Green. The beginning of the book starts of with a girl named Hazel Grace. She was diagnosed with thyroid cancer when she was 13 years old. When she turned 17 her mother forces her to go to a cancer support group. This is where she meets Augustus Waters a 17 year old boy, who was diagnosed with osteosarcoma caused him to lose his leg. My favorite part of the book is when there are multiple moods at one time. Like the characters go from sad to excited in just a few lines. I like having multiple moods in one book because it makes the book more interesting. There wasn’t anything I didn't like about this book because it was so good! I think it would be good for 13 and older would be a suggested age. It is a romantic and sad book at the same time. If you like a good plot twist than this is the perfect book for you. Hope you like the book liked I did!By: Morgan G"
5," When I read the book I visualized Hazel as more like the sweet warmhearted girl that I married, with whom I shared cancer support group and the whole awful experience.  After twenty-five years the jagged blade still cuts deep.  I read the book looking for hope, and sure enough there was some.  Still, I need a sequel, where the makers of Phalanxifor come out with a nanocyte vehicle where Hazel enters her own bloodstream, hunts the malignant terror cells down and kicks butt.  Where are the comic book heroes when you need them?  Then the movie came out with the cast of Divergent.  Not bad, just different.  The book wisely selects the good days, cancer patients don't get to select.  They endure plenty of bad days.  Author Van Houten told the truth more in what he didn't say, what Hazel wanted to hear, which was a fast forward to her own happy ending ... just write me something uplifting she pleaded, look, I even brought my own prince.  Sometimes you need to be lied to."
2," Knowing this book was very popular among my friends and pretty much everyone, I decided to read it. And of course it was only $5 so you know, It was a pretty good deal for a 321 page book. Anyway, I really LOVE this book. It's funny and heartbreaking at the same time. At the end, I have to admit, I did cry even though I knew what would happen. Now I don't want to give anything away, so it is going to be kind of hard to say one of the few things I didn't like a about this book. But at the end it only shows the email Augustus sent to Peter not the 4 attachments. But maybe I'm just stupid and that really was the four attachments, I don't know :P.  This book is pretty sad but it's still a great book. I would highly recommend this book. There's twists in the plot and some surprising things you wouldn't think would happen. I can't wait to see the movie even though movies are supposed to be worse than the books. So I would say get this book because you'll like it!"
4," So I already have an idea that this was not going to be a happy ending and yet I have read and finished the book not really feeling sad but inspired. It was a weird revelation for me, but I have come to appreciate life's many blessings. I am not sick or anything but I also know that nothing is permanent and that we do not actually know when our last day here on earth will be. So my philosophy is, count each day and each moment (whether good or bad) a blessing. It might be a cliche, but always live life to the fullest... Our lives may not count much for a lot of people, but make your life count for you, for the people we care for and love so dearly. Even if in the end, our lives were only lived ordinarily and simply, what matters is that we actually lived. Thank you John Green for this book, but unlike your idea of Hazel Grace, I do believe in life eternal. And though it may seem God is not fair, we as humans do not have the right to question His being and power."
5," loved this book. It took a chapter or two, but I was so involved in the story I couldn't put it down. I know some people had a hard time with the maturity of the teenagers in this book, but lets face it there are many people out there that are more mature than others. Especially when youth go through such life changing and life threatening things it changes someone. This book talk a little about the different ways some people handle things when that happens.Although this book did also have some foul language I also have to refer to my above statement. When you don't have much time left to live how much time would you waste with talking properly and appropriately?I  loved the fun and comical banter between the characters. Sometimes when it is that funny it can almost be over the top, but not in this case. I found myself, laughing, crying and screaming throughout the book. this is probably one of the best books I have read in a long time."
5," Two different (grown) men recommended this book in a matter of a week, so I felt compelled to get it because I typically don't care for girlie books.  I'm not much of a novel reader either, tending more towards personal growth, instructional and nonfiction.  I assumed I probably wouldn't care for this either, but I didn't read anything about the book before just starting on page 1.I COULDN'T PUT THIS BOOK DOWN!!!!  I'm not eloquent with words, but I can tell you, whether you're 13 or 90, this author will draw you in so intimately, you will feel it is your own experience.  Towards the end, I took longer breaks because I shuddered at the thought of it ending.  It is filled with so many gold nuggets of wisdom about life, love and death.I have already given it to three men, and they all adored it as much as I.  One is 26, one is 44 and one is 73 (and he's a literature professor)!Indulge and enjoy one of the finest, fun reads ever!"
5," Heart warming book, definitely had its sadder moments, but worth it to get to the ending.... Would recommend excited to watch the movie"
5, Type of book that you don't think would interest you but it draws you in.  Normally more a non fiction person but this is a good break.
5," used to not read at all, but now, because of this, I read 2 hours a day!!! I loved this book so much and can't wait to see the movie!"
5," Better than Love Story. Love Hazel's point of view. Can't wait to see the movie. Was recommended by my 14yo daughter, a John Green fan."
5, cried. And if you have a soul you will too. I loved the Hazel and Augustus and regardless of where we are in life we can always love.
5, For me I hate reading and its summer!! My friend Emily suggested me to read this and it was by far the best book I have  ever read!! :)
2," On of the best reads on my list this year; well written, great character development and engaging for the first few pages.  I loved it!"
5, Really enjoyed this book.  A fast read with a great ending. The characters in the book were endearing. I would definitely recommend it.
5, thought The Fault in Our Stars was incredibly well written and witty. The is the most enjoyable read I have had in quite a long time.
5, This was the best book ever  it had a lot of metaphor s and it was an unexpected ending and It had some humor so it wasn't all very sad
5, Obviously the best book in the world. #teenagewhitegirl no I mean it really is a great representation of love and hardship just amazing
5, couldn't stop reading the book. It kept me wanting to turn the page and see what was going to happen to these unfortunate characters.
5," This book made me realize how fortunate I am for my health and how powerful love is. All around amazing book, can't wait for the movie!"
4, Wonderful story but what I loved the most were the characters! It's been a long time since I've read a book with such great characters!
5,"t's been a long time since I've sincerely cried reading a book. I am a better person for having read this book. Thank you, John Green."
5,f you need a good cry then this is the book for you! You will spend at least 20% of the book in tears. Well written and a great story.
2, This book was amazing. It was written beautifully. The love between these two young people was something that brought tears to my eyes.
5," Best book I've ever read. So, so amazing. John Green manages to take his readers on a heart wrenching, crazy roller coaster every time."

5, This was a beautifully written book that made me laugh and cry. This is one of the best books I've ever read. A must read for everyone.
5, am the type of person who rarely reads and often loathes reading. However this book was just spectacular and I actually finished it!!
5," Stayed up all night to finish this! Made me laugh a lot, made me cry a lot, and is one of the best books I've read in a long long time."
5," A spectacular piece of realistic fiction, the sprinkles of poetry make it such an artistic read.Johnis a genius!  A fast favorite"
5, Great novel about teens and cancer. I loved the insight of the characters and the wording.  The main characters were wonderful to know.
5, only had to pick this book up a couple times because each time I did I couldn't stop reading. A very beautiful story about true love.
5, This is one of those books that takes a piece of you when are you done reading it. Its hard to understand why everyone isn't reading it
2," Okay, so I usually don't cry over books, but this one had me sobbing. It was so beautiful and tear jerking, and I couldn't put it down."
5," found it to be real, but beautiful. Green does a great job mixing the humor and the raw truth about life's (and death's) tough parts."
5," This book is a clever write, but will definitely induce tears. This book opened my eyes to the reality of what it really means to live."
5, Absolutely loved this book. The banter between the characters was so well written. I found myself laughing and crying at the same time.
5,"t made smile, laugh out loud, and cry. But mostly, it made me think. REALLY think about life, love, and the true importance of it all."
5, Although this book is about teenagers with cancer it was not sad or depressing.  The characters were well developed and very enjoyable.
5," Young adults facing the ugliness of cancer learn about priorities, relationships and love. A fun, compelling read. Recommend it highly."
5," This was a charming love story full of thought provoking moments.  The characters were real, but sweet.  I enjoyed the book thoroughly!"
5," This was a very sweet love story that everyone can appreciate.  Its an easy read, but also full of surprises.  I could not put it down."
5, Real. Insightful. Beautiful. Makes one appreciate life and love. Perfect. Not overly sappy but instead touching and inspiring. Read it.
2, Such an insightful book. I loved the writing style. It's hilarious and so sweet at the same time. Definitely a boom to read repeatedly.
5, An absolute joy  to read.....even with tears falling down your face.You'll laugh and cry and remember to be thankful for each day
5, Cancer seem from the eyes of a young victim - well-written and entertaining.  Ready it quickly.  Loved the book but not exactly upbeat.
5," Simply put, this was a beautiful book. I laughed, I cried, I thought deeply. Well worth the six or so hours it took to read. Marvelous."
4," Content drives the reader to reflect on their own mortality, Its an easy read with a universal, cross age and cross-gender appeal.My daughter and I discussed the content prior to and during the 3 days that I read (she had read in 2011). She had a vivid memory of web searches associated with Imperial Affliction (not a real book) and Anne Frank.  She also made the assessment that I wouldn't appreciate the ending.I enjoy the concept that the universe exists to be appreciated (paraphrased from book). Regardless of the duration of one's life the concept of striving to observe, engage and learn from the world around you is key.  The book does an excellent job leaving the reader with an immediate appreciation of life and a call to arms to make choices that drive a higher level of appreciation and participation.BTW, I enjoyed the ending. It was clear, clean and represented well the reciprocated appreciation that Gus had for Hazel."
5," This is about one girl's journey to her life's end. Terminal Cancer. The book isn't really about one girl, Hazel. It's really about all of the people who's lives she's touched and who've touched hers.I'm not going to go into a lot stuff about this, John Green' s, book because on Amazon there are over 5,000 reviews written for this story.Just my views. I loved this book. I cried, I laughed, I cried, I cried, I got angry, laughed and then cried some more. Enough of that. Just about everyone has been exposed to the reality of cancer in one way or another. Personally or through close friends or family. I think Hazel did as good a job as she could dealing with her own realities of her upcoming death. Almost all of her closest friends were cancer patients too. What a way to have to live your very short life. I think Hazel' s little life was better though for having loved Augustus.I highly recommend this book for YOUNG ADULTS AND OLD ADULTS TOO!"
4," There is to say but the fact that this was the best book I've ever read and I really fell in love with Augustus an Hazel. I cried so much when Gus passed away. I wish the author could write a sequel where apparently Gus was just uncontious and then is cured and digs his way out and runs to Hazels to find out that Hazel is cured too and he was planning to propose to her before he passed away and he had the ring with him all along and he proposed to her.  The Fault in Our Stars made everyone realize how hard falling in love with someone with cancer is harder than normal love. People with cancer are like ordinary people just with their faults. They are our  stars that have faults. John Green showed us what true love is; he is the best author to ever live. I want to thank him for writing The Fault in Our Stars and I would recommend this book to literally anyone.  Enjoy reading this Amazing, Hard Hitting, Romance and BEST BOOK EVER!"
5," (SPOILER ALERT!)Ok, the fact that I'm actually bothering to write a book review for this book, and rate it five stars, is a miracle itself. I'm not saying this lightly.I was hesitant to buy the book. I mean,the fact that it cost 3.99 was a big red flag to me. But the many good reviews made me think, OK, it can't be that bad, and press the `Buy' button.Anyways, it was a really good book. I sped through it like it was a giant marshmallow and I eating it in a race for 100 bucks. I can't say I was crying by the end, but I was so hoping that  Gus would live through the book. I was pretty sad. I am glad that the story itself wasn't one of those cliche stories where the girl and the boy live happily ever after, have five kids, etc. True cancer stories don't have happy endings. I'm glad that JOHN Green seems to understand that.My advice? Stop reading this and go buy the book. It's worth the four bucks you pay and more."
5," Wow, I see ALOT of 5 star reviews for this book but I just couldn't get there for that. To me, a 5 star book is a book that I CANNOT PUT DOWN and well, this is a book that I could put down. I wasn't up all night reading it. . .it's not gonna be a book that I hand onto to reread again.Did I enjoy it? YesThis book didn't resonate with me like it did with others....it didn't make me cry (which says alot because I CRY ALL THE TIME WHEN READING. .. my husband actually gets a kick outta that. . .it blows his mind that I can become so invested in a book that it moves me in that way) That being said. . . this book didn't do that for me.Dont get me wrong. . .I did enjoy it it's just not gonna make the bookshelf library I have (only books that I will read again make it to that)Best I can say is if you're thinking about reading it. . .wait till the price drops some more. You'll be glad you did.... I wish I had waited"
5, love how unique the story line is. I wasn't sure where the plot was going as I was reading it but it was a great well rounded story.
2, Beautifully written book about love and death and what children feel about life. A MUST READ BUT DOES REQUIRE TISSUES.CHERYL FOX

2,m speechless. End of story. This book broke my heart but simultaneously gave me hope. So raw and real it is unimaginable. Perfection
5," As a 15 year cancer survivor, I have groped for words, descriptions and metaphors for living with cancer. This book provided them all."
5, Smart/Ingenious telling of an impossibly difficult story. Be prepared to cry through the last third of the book. Completely worth it!!
5, really enjoyed this and have since read more Green novels. Well developed characters and great descriptions. Would recommend highly.
5," Great book, worth every penny. I bought this book for recreational reading.... And ended up finishing the book 10 hours later. Amazing"

5," great, nicely written story. felt real and relationships were genuinely faulted but beautiful at the same time. i wish it never ended!"
5,t really gave me a different view on the world and how sick kids feel. I really love it and feel like it changed me in a lot of ways.
5,"t shows an epic love story. And gives insight into a selfless girl's fight against cancer, I would recommend it to any of my friends."
5," Even though the characters in the book lead ordinary lives, John Green turns what seems to be a boring read into an amazing spectacle."
2, Absolutely amazing. It is for sure a tear jerker butan amazing read. Read it in 2days!  I think everyone should give it a try!:)
5," thought that this book would be over-hyped, but I ended up loving it. Would recommend to anyone seeking an engaging, emotional read."
5, The Fault in Our Stars left me at a loss of words. Showing you that sometimes they were strong and fought hard doesn't quite cut it.
5, 5starsA sad love story that touches everyone. I really liked the relationship between Gus and hazel and hope to have one like it
5, This book has so much emotion and is written by a truely amazing author! I would recommend this book to all my friends and even my mom
5, Excuse me as I fall apart. What am incredibly moving and touching support. I'm hopelessly in love with Hazel Grace and you will be too
5, Thank you John Green for making TFIOS so fantastically human. It's relatable and heartbreaking and wonderful. And I love every second.
5," This story was a great YA book.  I especially liked that it was set in Indiana, and that it was a different kind of book about cancer."
5, Looking for a sure-thing?  Look no further - totally worth your time. Loved it - not a literary masterpiece - but a solidly good book.
5," This book was phenomenal, Augustus and Hazel Grace are heroes. This is unlike any book I have read, will definitely remember this one."
2, Had me hooked from beginning to end. Get ready to laugh and cry...and cry...can't wait to see the movie as I am sure one will be made!
5," Absolutely amazing book...at sometimes slow but very good, I cried like a baby...and I felt the loss and that's what a great book does"
5, This book talked more about life than almost anything I've read before.  It was deep without being confusing and overall a great read.
5," What a beautifully written novel, I absolutely loved it. At times very funny, and heartbreaking sad, the characters altogether real."
5," Loved this book!  well written, thought provoking..  makes you happy and sad at the same time.  I would recommend this book at anyone."
5," My biggest criteria when judging a book is how emotionally involved I got with the characters.  It was easy to feel for Hazel and Augustus.  It was easy to get involved in the stories of loss, love, despair, and triumph.  The author took the time make me care not just about Hazel and Augustus, but also about their parents, their friends, and even the smaller characters.It was a story that took a look inside a sometimes touchy subject.  Most people don't want to dig too hard into the struggles and emotions of a cancer patient, but the reality is that there are more people than we'd like to think about that struggle with this disease every day.  I am not naive enough to think that they all have these same exact struggles, but it was nice to see a subject such as this explored, even if just for a few people.This book succeed in making me become emotionally involved, and I thought it was a great read!  Would definitely recommend it!"
5, Hi I'm Katey bug and my goal is to read all the books I can before my time to runs out and I take my thoughts and others and combine them into oneSo me and my team loved the book I do not have cancer at this point in time and believe that with this book John Green has achieved a great success with biting a heart breaking yet true book that many authors have not yet achieved we all loved the book very much and think that if you do not read it or do not feel at least the slight bit of emission in this book you have no heart I do encourage all ages to read it because we all take For granite our life's saying at least once that our life sucks but yet we as a whole have not looked around and asked if other people's life suck worse and in this book it proves that ice and death happen and we all have to deal with it and even if it seems unfair it is because Augustus didn't have any more lines in the play called life and that is why he did die
5," Hazel grace is 17 she has cancer (in her lungs I recall) and her mom makes her go to this remission group, there she meets the cute, funny, amazing, Augustus Waters. As they leave he asks her to go home with her and watch a movie. They start falling for  each other. However Hazel doesn't want to be a grenade , which basically mean she wants to hurt as little people as possible when she dies, as it's inevitable, she introduces him to a book that she loves where the author made the main character die and the book abruptly ended. She wants to meet the author so her and Augustus go to Amsterdam to meet him to get answers where their love progresses. The Fault In Our Stars tells a beautiful and mesmerizing love story. From Hazel's point of view you get the sad parts, the happy parts, and everything in between. In this fantastic novel you'll learn that not everything is perfect but as life goes on you have to learn to make it the best you can."
5," gave it 4 stars because of the ending. For some reason I felt unsatisfied. I just did. I'm definitely about to read it again since I read this in like two days. (I work full time otherwise I would have probably finished it in a day.) Maybe the second time around I won't feel so empty. Other than that this book was simply amazing in all its simplicity...yet complexity. My emotions were all over the place even though I kind of figured someone was going to die. And my throat did close up when Hazel had that moment on the couch with her parents after the unfortunate event. But, I liked how I didn't feel bad thinking that Hazel and Augustus had no future because they already knew that and had come to terms with it. In the same breath that acceptance made it even more necessary for them to be together. Anyways like I said, I'll be reading this again, and again, and again because death is...life and I believe this book serves as a necessary a reminder."
5, My daughter got this before she went to the movies to see it. Her and her friend that read it loved it. I may have to read it myself.
2, The fault in our stars was a great book. I inspire you to read this book. You might have some tears but it is a great love story also

5," the way john green writes is so relatable and understandable, but so intrricate at the same time. the book finished perfectly for me."
5, Wow. Ditto the other reviewers'  hilarious and heartbreaking comments. One of the best books I've read this year. And I read A LOT.
4, So freaking sad and heartbreakily beautiful. John green always manages to make breathless and impressed. Favorite author for sure. A+
5, This book really stuck with me after I read it. Loved it! Beautiful story. Once I started reading I didn't want to put the book down.
5,"t isn't often that I am impressed with contemporary literature, but I have to admit that this is one of the best I've read in years!"
5, This is a great read. Full of emotion and young love and loss.It is quite short so perfect for a short holiday or long plane journey.
5," This is a great book.It had me smiling, laughing, thinking, reminiscing and wondering as I read it.I highly recommend it."
5, Just a lovely story. So funny and heartbreaking and honest.  Not just for young adults. I also highly recommend Looking for Alaska.
2, have never cried so hard to a book. Augustus and hazel will forever be stuck in my mind. The love they shared was Turkey beautiful.
5, cried more than once. Beautifully written. A must read for everyone ages 12 and up. I wish there was more time for Augustus Waters.
5," John Green’s young adult novel, The Fault in Our Stars, is basically a story about teens battling cancer. The elements of a love story come to the front when Hazel and Augustus fall in love after meeting up in a Support Group for cancer patients. Both of them are super intelligent and highly loquacious (as most of John Green’s teens appear to be), so we’re privy to a lot of philosophical jargon and literary quotes throughout the story.Hazel is a sweet kid who hates being singled out because of her cancer, but her disease is fundamentally her parents’ raison d’être (typical of most parents), and because of her special needs, her social, and possibly her emotional, freedoms are compromised.This story is not for the faint of heart. All aspects of the story revolve around the terrible ravages of the disease, and at some point the tone is almost unbearable. No one wants to witness pain and despair, especially in children; so be prepared ."
5," This novel destroyed me from the inside out. I avoided it, because I thought it was going to be another Cancer Kid book that makes me cry. It is (a Cancer Kid book) and it did (make me cry), but it went way beyond that. I think it set a new standard that other authors in this genre will struggle to live up to.I let this story into my life, all the gorgeous notions and metaphors and ideas and words. I almost wanted to be the characters, full of wit, humor, life, and individuality, despite how difficult, messy, and painful their lives actually were. And then the grenade exploded. The shrapnel pierced me, and I stood by and let it happen. Because some stories are worth bleeding over, worth crying for, and worth screaming at the universe for.The ache it leaves is a tragic side effect...of Epic Stories, not Dying. Well, both actually.Read with caution: I think it left a new scar on my well-traveled reader's heart."
4," TFIOS does to you what you'd expect out of a cancer novel: make you cry, make you worry about every moment of discomfort Hazel or Augustus experience as if the disease is pumping through your own body. However, it is not just a cancer novel--it captures beautifully the lives of two pseudo-intellectual teens with a penchant for sarcasm and poetry. I found myself drawn to the witty and bright nature of Augustus, while also amused and fascinated by the lovely portrayal of Hazel's refreshing teenage girl character.I laughed, and of course I cried, but not just at the moments you would expect--from Caroline 's wall page, to Hazel musing over Shakespeare (and revealing the titular origin), to the date in Amsterdam with the liquid stars, I was overcome with the beauty of the novel, and the nature of its characters.Bless you, Mr. Green.And thank you for not ending the novel mid-sentence, like I worried you would :)"
5," When I first heard of the fault in our stars I thought it was another weird book that stupid teens were infatuated with, but when I saw the trailer for the movie weeks ago for the hundredth time it seemed like, I decided that it was worthy enough me to read. I saw the trailer for the first time while I was watching  the movie awards, but I really didn't get how the plot of the story went.  My friends had read it before I did, and said that it is an amazing book, but we all have different tastes, so I didn't go for their word. I got tired of people talking about it and spoiling the book so I read it. I did unfortunately watch the movie BEFORE I read the book, but it was worth it. This book is truly wonderful and makes you look at life at a different way, and it also shows how important and beautiful love is.  I thank John Green for writing this wondered book, and I hope there will be another book published to continue the story of Hazel's life."
5," This has to be one of the greatest pieces of literature that I have encountered in my short sixteen years. Firstly, I commend John Green for not depicting all teenagers as vastly uneducated and immature creatures. We can conduct thoughts analogous to what is being thought of. We can make sense. We can be deep. Secondly, I gave this book five stars for a reason. It made me cry about six times, but no, it isn't your typically depressing and then suddenly uplifting cancer book. This is a love story. It made me laugh, sigh, smile and cry (I'm not that sensitive), and it captured my attention without the addition of any boring scenes. I won't be a brat and spoil anything for you, but the ending definitely didn't suck. I loved this book and I plan on reading it again at least five more times. I'm not crazy- it was just that amazing. Aside from the plot, the diction, tone, imagery and symbolism were awesome. I couldn't be more grateful. Just read it."
5, was blown away just within the first few pages and found myself unable to stop reading. The intense vocabulary and intelligence written on these pages is nothing short of incredible. It has been a long time since I have read a book that knocked me off my feet. I have dealt with a cancer ridden loved one and can say that this book portrays exactly how my eyes have seen their struggle and pain. I have also personally dealt with earth shattering pain at a way too young age and the way John Green writes Hazel's internal struggle describes my experience in a way no one else has ever been able to capture. The descriptions were well thought out and allowed me an insight into a world I have never walked through in my own shoes. I have thoroughly enjoyed this book and plan to add it to my arsenal of re-reads. I am sure that TFIOS will quickly become my favorite just as AIA was Hazel's when all else around felt wrong and so far away from her reality.
5," didn't expect to like this book, honestly. I felt that it was another in a long line of teenage angst books that tell similar stories. The people who tend to recommend TFIOS to me are not people I usually take book recommendations from.But someone compared something I've written to this book which pealed my curiosity (for example, I wasn't sure whether it was an insult or a compliment) so I bought it on my Kindle and there it sat for months.Until last weekend when I decided to finally pick it up.I read it in a day and I'm reading it again.The Fault In Our Stars us equal parts funny, sad and introspective. When I finished it -corny as this may sound- I genuinely felt like something in me had changed though I have yet to identifyI highly recommend this book for anyone who feels lost or alone. Whether or not cancer has touched your life you will be able to relate to these characters."
5, Finished in one sitting - a beautiful story.So well written - You should read this book.Just Magnificent.wow
2, please read! this book was amazing everyone should read it it really teaches you a lesson in life I recommend this book to everyone!

5, Hazel and Augustus face their sad fate bravely. As a parent it was tough to face. How do you accept that your child cannot be saved?
5, This book is simply amazing. I have no words to describe how much I loved this book. I will never forget it and how it made me feel.

5, John Green has done it again. Ge manages to write a book about such a serious and important topic but keep it upbeat and interesting
5," REVIEW WRITTEN BY MY TEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTERThis is pretty much one of the best books I've ever read. It was so good I didn't want to read it. Like, I saw I was getting closer to the end, and I stopped, because I didn't want it to end. I wanted a sequel, but, then, what more is there to tell? This book made me think about this world, this infinity, oblivion, and myself as a person. This is truly the kind of book that touches your heart.Now, on to the re-occurring issue of who this book is appropriate for. I am a mature (or so I like to think) ten year old girl. And when it comes down to who this book is appropriate for, that is my statement. A mature ten year old. No less.I know this review is kinda long-winded, but I've read reviews that are much more long winded than this. I hope this helps you decide whether or not you are going to read this book. The only reason I can think of that you wouldn't WANT to read it is the sadness."
5," Thanks to my sister, I finally read THE FAULT IN OUR STARS. She had been encouraging me to read it for, what, a couple years? But I kept resisting. I knew the book was about teenagers, so it didn't interest me. But I gave in.If you haven't read this book yet because it's about teenagers, do. The teenagers are exceptionally bright, well spoken, and mature. The story (which I won't tell you about because it's a short book, and anything I say is potentially a spoiler) grabbed me from page 1. Don't read reviews of it.Something irritated me, though: Hazel really does seem stupid when it comes to her favorite book, which is a work of fiction. The end left her with questions about what became of three of the characters. (Yes, I consider a hamster a character.) And, boy, she really needs to know! It takes a drunk to tell her that nothing became of them because they aren't real.But you probably already read this."
5," For my summer reading, I chose to read The Fault In Our Stars.  My sister recommended that I should read this book because she thought I would enjoy the story.  She read the book and told me that she really enjoyed it.  I also had many friends that read the book and told me that I would love the story.  I would recommend this book to another high school reader because most high school student read books that involve a love story and The Fault In Our Stars is a love story that people can relate to.  I would tell them that this book is about a girl who has Cancer and how she thinks that her life won't be special and that nothing good will happen to her.  This book did not meet my expectations because I though that the book would be just a boring book about a girl and her Cancer story, but really it is about a girl and her trying to have a normal life while living with Cancer even though some things might not happen the way she wants them to."
5," just finish reading this book and my heart aches with joy and sadness. Two extreme emotions that in rare and not so rare occasions can cross paths and linger at the fork for a while. Well, I'm currently standing at that fork with happy tears and an aching heart that I came across such an incredible story.The characters in this story were profoundly depicted and well developed. I was able to feel the pain and agony of each character--their impotence to prolong their lives and love and the heartbreaking realization that in the end we must all succumb to life's will. Gus teaches the reader that by bowing down to the will of the universe does not mean he gave up on life, instead, he gave in to it. Gave in by choosing to live the best life he could with whatever time he had left. This book focuses on the art of celebrating life and enjoying every second of it around those we love the most. A lesson we often need to be reminded of."
5," Ok, now lets just get something straight, I never re-read books. Never. I hate watching a movie more than once (usually). I already know what's going to happen, why watch it again, right? Not this book, not at all. I wasn't even finished the book when I already wanted to re-read it, to laugh again as I read it and even to cry again. I can't wait to read it again, and not only that, this book is a long time coming too I've seen the quotes and gotten all of these recommendations, everything but I never got around to it. I'm so glad I finally did, I finished it in roughly two days, and I couldn't put it down. The Fault In Our Stars is probably my favorite book, it has such a deeper meaning yet puts it in such a way that you enjoy it, that it makes sense. And more importantly in a way that sticks with you a way, in a way that you will never forget. That I won't forget Augustus Waters, or Hazel Lancaster because they've already left their scar."
5," With over six thousand reviews, I know I'm not going to be saying anything new or clever here. Heck, I rarely bother writing reviews on the books I read.However, I just had to say something about how much I loved The Fault in Our Stars. I was hooked from the very first page and didn't want to put it down. I read it in the car during my lunch breaks. I read it at home and made my husband wonder why I was ignoring him. The last time I read a book so voraciously was Deathly Hallows (six years ago!), and that was also the last time I felt a real emotional connection to literary characters and what happens to them. I laughed with them, I cried with them (like the soon-to-be 30 year old baby that I am) and when the book ended, it left me wanting more. John Green is really a master of his craft.If you are reading this review and trying to decide whether or not to buy this book...don't think. Just read it. You won't be disappointed."
5," This book was fantastic, and horrible, and wonderful, and tragic.  There are almost no words to describe the amount of emotions the reader goes through while reading this book.  First of all, you're pulled immediately into the story and you do not want to put the book down.  The more you read the better it gets, and isn't that what we all really want when we pick up a book?  I also loved that while it's a book about people with cancer, it wasn't totally 100% sadness all the time.  There were moments of pure hilarity and I found that endearing.  I fell in love with Hazel, and Augustus, and even Isaac.  I feel this is one of those stories that will stay with me a lifetime.  One I might actually be tempted to re-read...and I don't say that about many books for the plain and simple fact that there are too many great books in the world to read.  I don't know what audience I'd suggest this too, other than basically anyone who enjoys reading."
5, You will cry during.And after.And a week after.And a month after.But ya it's a good book u should read it!!
2," literally cried during reading this book.The movie is life.Well done John Green,Well doneMaybe okay will be our always FAVE QUOTE"
5, Great story! What an emotional ride! Looking forward to reading other John Green books! Hoping they will be as as good as this one!
2," Made me cry. Real tears. John green is one of my favorite authors ever. Great for teens, and any age really. Just... Read it, Okay?"
5, This book reminds me why I fell in love with reading. A great love story with real life characters which makes it easily relatable.
5," can not wait for the movie to hit theatres! I cried the last ten chapters and I am not lying! If you haven't read it, you need to"
5, There is a high probability that you will love this book.Speaking in general terms of the nerd population that I have in mind
5," Two -- and more -- teenagers with terminal cancers.  This is not a cheerful subject.  However, the wit and determination of the two"
5," Although depressing, this book also gave me hope and a look at the reality of cancer and dying, and what matters most in this life."
5, love it but it makes me cry every time. John Green is amazing with his words. I don't know how he has that ability but I love it.
5," Excellent, quick read.  It deals with an interesting concept.  This book will appeal to young adult readers and the young at heart."
5, Beautiful and brilliant and funny and heartbreaking and possibly the best thing I've read in years.I may never recover.
5," Very different story line, quite sad, but also much dry humor. Many friends have also read this book, all have given a good rating."
2, love the book. It was witty and bittersweet. Definitely a good read. Highly recommended for anyone who is looking for a good book
5," really liked this story. It was very touching  and emotional. I highly recommend it, be assured it will bring tears to your eyes."
5,"ve read this book five times and it has never stopped inspiring, nor bring tears to my eyes. This has got to be my favorite book."
5, Tragically lovely. I'd read this a thousand times and never get old of this story. I've never been so enlightened by a book before.
5," love love love love love. Moving, honest, funny, insightful, and one of a kind. I would recommend to anyone looking for a good read"
5," This book was addictive. I read it in one day and I must say,bravo. I haven't had a good book that made me this emotional in years."
5, Absolutely perfect. I've fallen in love with this story. It made me think about everything in my own life. I fell in love with Gus.
5," This is probably not going to be a popular review. Full disclosure, I listened to this as an audio book, the unabridged edition.I gave this book three out of five stars. Quite frankly, I just couldn't connect with the characters and found the book a bit boring. There was one point about ¾ of the way through that I thought was a great place to end the book. It would have left me guessing and wondering. Now, I don't have to do any of that and I probably won't give this book another thought.I always question whether or not books (and movies for that matter), just get overhyped. I had this on my to be read list right after it came out. But then it was pushed so much and the audiobook was cheap in anticipation of the movie release.I thought this was generally predictable and shallow and required too much suspension of belief on my part. I was disappointed in it. But then, I'm not a teenage girl either."
5," The book shows a love story of two teenagers who have cancer.  I listened to an audio version first. From the sound of this audio book, I can understand the emotional parts of the characters clearer. The one thing was missing was some of the vocabularies. As an English as a second language reader, audio book did not help me understand the concept deeply, since there are a lot a words that I am not familiar with. So I bought the book and wanted to read one more time. I have been reading for days, the book makes me feel better. I can underhand better and I can look the words up if I do not understand.  The love feels real in the story, which is unusual in young adult love stories.It is a wonderful book for young adults. The book is so touching and I recommend the book for the young adults who will or are in love with others. It may be a good lesson for them before their adults' lives.  The movie should be interesting to watch as well."
5," loved this book (like most of the rest of the world). As an adult reader and parent, I related to it as a parent and I cried more than once. Green has a gift for dialogue. He can do funny. He can do deep. He can do love. And the thing that I find never fails in his writing, is the believeability. I believed in these teens. They sounded and acted like teens. I listened to TFIOS on audio book and the out loud reading added to my experience. On a side note, I was signing books at the LA Times Festival of the book last year for my YA novel DEATH SPIRAL. My nine year old daughter was with me. Before the signing, we waited in John Green's line to get a book signed, but there must've been five thousand people in his line and given the hot sun, we gave up. When my daughter discovered that you could count the number of people at my signing on one hand, she said I wish you were John Green. To which I said, Don't we all!"
2," The love story that is Augustus and Hazel Grace is the type of love story that we see only in the fictional works of romantics like John Green. But I do think that Mr. Green did something extremely important in this book. He shows us, that even the most perfect of love still isn't perfect. The Fault in our Stars is a story that reassures us that love will come and it will cause us pain, whether it be through the loss of loved one as all those who loved Augustus experienced, or whether it be from love that ultimately falters and for whatever reason doesn't work out. This book teaches us that love, as powerful and euphoric as it an be is also inevitably both finite in duration and because of that, painful. This book is a beautiful story that portrays love for what it really is, real. And also shows that none of us are truly stronger or better than another. We are all human and we all cope and survive when the universe demands us to."
5," found this book to be a difficult read because I am a mother of a beautiful little girl suffering from a different kind of disease that is 100% terminal. Cystic Fibrosis, a disease she was born with &amp; will live the rest of her life in suffering. I fear that she will become isolate, feel like a failure because of her limitations, but mostly I fear losing her &amp; know that I will but not when. I was a single mother/divorcee for several years &amp; had every intention of staying that way because I felt it unfair to bring others into our suffering. I am now remarried &amp; my daughter has a little sister. I still feel guilt when I think about it &amp; dread the day I have to explain to my youngest daughter why sissy isn't coming home. This story puts our story on paper. I hoped that by reading this book I would get some sort of insight as to what to expectant in the future &amp; how to deal with it when it comes. I do believe it has done just that."
5," Although this book caused me to break down sobbing on an airplane (I received many judging glances), this story was incredibly and utterly inspiring. Before this I was always aware of the cancer in the world, but I never really put much thought into it or how it affected people; but after I finished this book in only a few hours (which I very much enjoyed), I finally realized the importance behind it. Now when my dad comes home from his work at the hospital saying, I cured another cancer patient today, I will appreciate it much more and modern sciences concerning it. This novel creates a dimension where it is only you and the book, similar to the one only Augustus and Hazel share. It creates a special relationship between you and the characters- I feel as if I have been there the whole time shadowing them, building relationships with them. I know I will never quite find a book like this again, for nothing can compare to this."
5," loved this book. I just finished reading it for my third time in between august 2013- may 2014. I had to re-read it before I see the movie on june seventh which is my birthday(: my two best friends have both read the book after I told them to read it, and now we have been fangirling over just talking about the book and watching the trailer over and over again. I love watching tfios interviews. But anyway i feel like this movie can explain so many teenagers just like Hazel or Gus. Not just with the cancer just maybe they loved someone so dearly. I don't really know how else to explain this book other than it seriously changed my perspective of life or just the world around us and realizing how many people have gone through so much pain. Like Hazel, Gus, and even Isaac.  I highly recommend reading the book before you watch the movie, especially because you can re-live all the emotions you had reading the book during the movie."
5, After all the hype of the movie and book I decided to look into it. I'm glad I did. Couldn't put it down. Now I'm on to the movie.
5," seriously thought this book was a little too hyped up. It was a good, easy read but should definitely be left for the teenagers."
5,"f you are questioning whether or not to read this book..your answer to that question is yes, read it. You'll love it I promise :)"
2," This was a lovely book- enjoyed it thoroughly. Made an unapproachable topic normalized, relatable, and real. I would recommend it!"
5, loved this book so much and cried but it is still very good and I can't wait to see the movie I think this book was fantastic!!!

5," Amazing. I would recommend this book to everyone, it's definitely a must read. Be prepared for emotions and to bawl your eyes out."
4, Heartbreaking and beautiful at the same time. Really makes you think and appreciate life in general. Love the witty humor as well.
5, My 14 year old daughter bought it and loved it so I read it also.  I really enjoyed it too.  My husband even read it and liked it.
5, This book leaves your mind with an infinite amount of questions. It opens up doors  in your brain that you probably never knew of.
2," loved every letter in this book, awesomely written and moving story.... it changed my personality and my act within the mankind."
5, Tough touch subject matter with grace and humor.  I literally found myself laughing out loud at times and truly enjoyed this read.
5, really like this book- and it really did make me laugh and cry. It's not your typical love story- I was pleasantly surprised! :)
5,t grabbed me early on and kept me spellbound throughout. I really became attached to all the characters. I finished it in 2 days.
5," This is a touching story that is so well-written, but definitely have tissues handy. I can't wait to read John Green's other work."
5, the language was fantastic and painted emotions.The characters were very believable and so heroic in their living of life and love
5," this book is filled with beautiful moments, it's moving and it's humourous! and although my copy wasn't signed, I love it to bits!"
5, Beautifully tragic. To simplify: The definition of humanness is the opportunity to marvel at the majesty of creation.  MUST READ
5," What a touching story, beautifully written. This is the first John Green and I hope to read more. An easy read, you'll shed a tear"
5, Hands down one of the best books I have ever read. Any age can enjoy this book. . Definitely worth the money I'll be reading again
2," Great book. Easy to read. Fluid. Touched your heart, your mind, your soul. Reminded you of the lives of others and to be grateful."
5, loved this book!  Not much more I can say about it than that!  I hope that she is happy with her choice as I am happy with mine!
5,"ve never read a book better, everything was perfect...I feel lucky for reading it, I feel very lucky for reading it."
5, This book is marvelously heart breaking. I loved it. I could feel my heart shatter more and more with every word after Chapter 19.
5," My teenage daughter recommended this book to me and I finally got around to reading it. It was a surprisingly not so depressing book about kids with Cancer. Very well written, starring likable, clever characters. A librarian I spoke to said that she didn't like the book very much because the characters weren't believable and that they were too witty to be real teenagers. I don't agree--maybe real teenagers don't speak like these characters do, but it would be cool if they did! Also, if the book were some glum, depressing book about kids with Cancer, I don't think as many people would be reading it, and we all want our kids to read, right? Probably, if I were my daughter, I would give the book five stars. I really liked this book, but my predictions about how the book would turn out were right on, and sometimes, I like to be wrong. Still, enjoyable. Oh, and I have been very close to the Literal Heart of Jesus, so that was fun!"
5,"m not a tremendous fan of YA literature, but I must say this is one of the better ones. At times the author's voice and intellect overtook the adolescent voice of Hazel and sometimes Gus; however, I also appreciate intellect, literary allusion, and realism. My grandmother died of cancer and my mother is in remission, so I appreciate the author's attempt at treating cancer in a more raw, realistic way. It's hell, but it's life. Saccharine treatments of love and illness are what typically turn me off from YA and pop-lit, so I enjoyed the jabs made at cliches and the attempts to write love and loss differently (e.g. kissing in the Anne Frank house made me enjoy the juxtaposition of young love and impending death or the parallelism between Anne and Hazel). Overall, it was a very thoughtful meditation on life, young love, and death. The universe wants to be noticed, and indeed, I noticed it in this novel."
4," When I pick a book, I generally tend to read the bad reviews first. Why??? Because Fad books such as these tend to receive reviews that cannot separate the writing from its popularity and therefore cannot always be properly critical when needed. Anyhow, between the gushing reviews and the fact this is not the normal book I'd scoop up it dropped to last place on my what-do-I-read-next list. THANK GOODNESS on a whim a hit download mostly because I was tired of trying to choose a book ... I will not likely forget this story anytime soon- wonderfully written, clever, and unique. Many lower star reviews held the opinion that the cancer theme was an unneeded backstory mostly used to garner sympathy from its readers- but I believe this to be untrue, as the inevitability of death is also in our stars just as life is, and this book makes us recognize both and cancer is the tool the writer chose to teach us that"
4," really wish it wasn't one in the morning, or that I had the patience to wait until morning to review this book... but to quote our incomparable Hazel Grace the world is not a wish granting factory.This book is a beautiful blessing of a book, the kind you have to immediately recommend to someone so it can be shared... it has to be shared.Like all of Green 's novels it is deceptively simple; clear, simple prose and impossibly charming characters (seriously there are almost zero unlikeable characters in this book) allow for its complex ideas and philosophy to go unnoticed until its true, profound nature hits you in the chest in such a personal way that you find it hard to believe that the book wasn't written for your eyes alone.It is a very fine, very special novel about life and death in both a small personal and a large universal sense.I loved it. Read it now. Pass it on."
5," When I picked up this book, all I knew about it was that it had 11,000+ 5-star ratings on amazon.com. YIKES, I thought! That must be one great book! It is a very good book, but a very sad book. I can't rate it 5-stars because my definition of FIVE means I want to read it again and again. One round of this heartbreak is enough for me. The characters are well-developed, the plot has some interesting twists and turns, the heartbreak you think you are preparing for is not the heartbreak you get. The characters' voices were realistic and they will stick with me for a long time. I think it would make a good movie - but I'm not sure I would want to see it. I just couldn't stop thinking about how incredibly SAD it would be to have a child with cancer. (Understatement). It made it hard for me to enjoy the humorous anecdotes and quirky personalities of the characters. Recommended, but only if you can handle the topic emotionally."
5, love this book. I hate how people stare at me becuse I am eleven and am reading a book some adults cant get their heads around.
2," touching, Spirit lifting, happy, Augustus was so sweet through out the book, I thought it was a great book about cancer survivors"
5,"m still reading this book, but it's clearly a very good reading. I recommend it to everyone and I'm anxious to watch the movie!"
5, Good book. It is very entertaining and a real page turner. My couin told me about it and I thank her for it!!! You should read it
4," loved this book.  The characters were real, I felt their love and their pain.  It moved me to tears and made me laugh out loud."
5," saw the movie trailer for this book and couldn't wait to read it!! It exceeded my expectations, I couldn't put the book down !!"
5," Read it in two sittings, excellent story and characters, well worth your time and money, should appeal to anyone with a heartbeat"
5, Really sad story but very well written and an amazing story :) it really touches the heart and you may cry but still a good book.
5, This book captured my heart! Young love at its best. I didn't want the book to end. I will definitely read more John Green books.
5, Very  amazing book. I cried and laughed. All-around an amazing book. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone. Two thumbs up.
5, This book kind of explores ideas and emotions which are too deep to put into words but the author does it brilliantly. Good read.
2, Loved this book. the characters are smart and wise beyond their years. it was a fantastic book. i recommend it to all my friends.
5," Amazingly written, beautiful story and always stayed on plot. The twists kept you reading. I would recommend this book to anyone."
5, One of the best books I've ever read. Augustus waters makes my heart swell i love him and wish I could find an Augustus of my own
5, loved the plot of this book. It's very sad but one of the best books I've read in a while. John Green is an exceptional writer.
5," Beautiful story, it had me thinking about it for weeks after I read it! I laughed and cried and laughed some more and I loved it!"
5, Just absolutely amazing!! I recommend everyone to read. One of the best books I have ever read. Amazing!! Fantastic!! Astounding!
5, Really a must read.  Now exploring Green's other works!  It really explores teens dealing with a terminal illness in a new light.
5, Amazing... I couldn't put it down. This book will have you addicted by the second chapter! I suggest this story for young adults.
5,t is a wonderful touching story that I would recommend to all ages. I fell in love with the characters and couldn't put it down.
5," This book was so great and I loved it! Everyone should read it! The story is unlike anything I have ever read, it will change you"
2," This book was very good. I loved the story and the main character/narrator. Very sad, but still funny at times and not too heavy."
5, Excellent book! It had me laughing and crying. The book was sad but set a tone of hope. It reminded me of what love is all about.
5," Tears and laughter throughout the book.  Young love at its best!  Not your usual cancer book, but very real to the end."
5, Used this for adult book club where we brought our kids - very successful! John Green's books are easily read and make you think.
5," Amazing and touching. Just like Hazel wants to know what happens to Anna, i want to know what happens to Hazel. I love this story"
5," This book was fabulous. Not too kind to your heart or feelings, but it was fabulous. I'm sure people will come to love this book."
5, One of the best books I've ever read. It really makes you realize how much you should appreciate life and to never stop fighting.
5," No words can describe how perfect this book is.I am not some important critic. just read the book, if you have not already."
5," The Fault in Our Stars will not disappoint you. Just make sure to have a box of tissues handy. Overall, it was an excellent read."
5, This book is beautiful and astonishing and took me to a place I didn't expect. The work John Green put into this book is evident.
2," This book is probably one of the best books I have ever read.You learn a lot from this book. It is a book that teaches you what its like on that not-so-happy-ending-storys. But its also one of those books were its almost like a happy ending, but also not. Its so heart breaking, romantic, and wonderful in so many ways that it makes me wanna go somewhere random and start rolling in grass. Ya you heard me. Its even better when you read it at 3AM. I personally love this book so much. It really inspires me and you know that when you try to put yourself in their shoes. Imagine having cancer. I cant imagine it. And then also getting a scan and realizing that half of your body is living with cancer, or going blind, or having the most suckyest lungs ever.And sometimes I thing MY life is bad when I have a perfectly good one.Excuse me now I'm going to raise money for a charity-Sofia(11 yrs old)"
5," You ever read a book that is so beautifully painful that you can't put it down even though tears? That you feel obligated to finish as if reading its final--inevitable--conclusions will honor those characters who once lived amidst it's pages? That is the book The Fault in Our Stars for me. I feel so deeply in love with the star-crossed, intertwined ambitions of it's world. The story of it's characters' lives will surely live on through me--equals in my mind to any real being--, and in only so much depth as my perspective can lend, impacting lives beyond where the text ends. Thank you for making me smile along this journey and prodding my own existential wanderings. This book brings to the front lines the true battle within humanity and between consciousness. It's a surreal, and eloquent ride in the mind of a true, humbling Observer. Surely, as I imagine for Hazel, August Water's smile will be burned in my mind forever."
5," don't want to give it 5 stars, but I must.  I don't want to because it tore my heart out and made me weep as I haven't  wept in years. The grand suck-i-tude of how much the story broke my heart made me want to throw my kindle across the room. However, anytime a story grips me until the very last page, makes me nash my teeth in bitter despair and frustration, while weeping for joy at the poignant beauty of it all, it must be given a 5. This book really should get a 6. It gives a raw, honest, irreverent perspective on what it means to be human while dying. As gut wrenching as it is, it is truth. Not some sterilized cliche with a stereotypical happy ending that gives meaning to all the suffering. It is hilarious and sad, deep and lighthearted, heavy and soaring, intellectual and silly. All the things that make us real. Best book I've read in ... I honestly don't know how long."
5, Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters are the two main characters of this book. They are two teenagers that are faced with cancer in their life. Together they try to live as normally as they can and fall in love along the way. The genre is a romantic comedy. I feel that it is entertaining to the right audience. If a teenage girl reads this book and is interested in romantic books that are sappy they will feel this book is entertaining. However the book could be predictable. I knew at times that things were going to occur only because the always happen in other book and movies as well. It is an easy read besides sometimes in the book the author makes the kids seem smart and use bigger words than an average teenager would use. This makes the book confusing at times and not as relatable as it could be. Once again I would recommend it to the correct audience. If the person does like sassy girly books then they would like this.
5," Housekeeping - absolutely no issues and there shouldn't be with an established, publishing house author. Although sometimes one is surprised be errors found in books that should NOT have them, those who have the machine providing editing resources have no excuse (unlike us Indies LOL).Wow to the nth degree. It's been a LONG time since I ugly cried so much, from the sadness and the joy found in this same sadness. I know lots of readers say the characters are one-dimensional, presumptuous, that there is no way kids this age have this kind of wisdom, etc. I don't care. Whatever the subject matter this is fiction and it is beautifully written fiction with an amazing story.Grief does not change you, it reveals you. EPICCan't wait to see the movie, the trailers look good and if this is anything like this story I'll be needing a whole box of tissue stashed in my purse!"
4,"t did hurt reading this book. When I started, yes I did  know Augustus dies, I did know he becomes frail and almost pitiful, and I did know that Hazel breaks down. But what I didn't know is that it hurt me. No, I'm not that easily tangled up in fictional characters, and I know it must seem dumb, crying and hurting over a love story. I had someone pass a way recently. And it was really, really hard for me. He was like my second dad, always there for me, and like in the book when Hazel says the only person she wanted to talk to about Gus dying was Gus, she was so, so right. Applause to John Green for making thousands of people sob, for making people fall in love with Hazel, Augustus, and everybody else, and for making people's hearts ache. Applause to everyone dealing with pain much worse than mine. Applause to that someone fighting for themselves, their loved ones, and the world. And applause to you, mere reader."
5," First of all, what I liked about the book was that it was an easy read and truly witty in some of its dialogue.  However the conversations were too deeply intellectual for the age of the characters. Nevertheless I did find it interesting the way cancer was addressed by cancer patients and the way different families deal with their children's illnesses.What lost a star is that I don't think the book is in that memorable category.Second star lost because the idea of a mom taking her young and sick teenage daughter on a trip with her dying teenage boyfriend to ultimately enjoy a roll in the hay, well that's just too modern family for me.I would say if you have a loved one as I do who is now battling cancer it is worth reading the book to take a different perspective on a patient's thought process and perhaps to get a glimpse into the mind of someone facing the ultimate finality."
5, Well written. John Green is the voice for people who dont have one. Beautiful story. One of my favorite books of all time &lt;3
3, A true love story no one can replace the love they had. They will always be together. True love will always exist dead or alive.

5," What more to say than an honest account of the cruel circumstances of life, and the inevitable clash between love and heartache?"
2, Great book! I couldn't put it down! Definitely recommend to anyone. It is very sad though. John green is my new favorite author.
5, This is one of my favorite book because it shows how life sees us. And I know what it's like to have a loved one who has cancer.
5," will start by saying cancer sucks.  It has to really suck if you are a teenager fighting it.  Although this story is fiction, it was captivating for me as a mom.  I could understand Hazel's mom as she sometimes appeared to be a creeper watching and worrying about her daughter's every move.  I think most people, both young and old would enjoy reading about young love that happens to involve two teenagers struggling with cancer and trying so hard not to be victims.  The story is funny at times and heartbreaking at others.  However we choose to make our mark on the world, we really are all the same.  Cancer free or not, everyone deserves to be loved and to love.  It is our human condition.  I laughed at the oxymoron, cancer perks while finding myself immersed in the lives of three young people who became friends because of cancer.  I was able to read this book very quickly, enjoying every delicious minute of it."
5," read a fault in our stars when my friend recommended it to me. I read the first chapter and forgot about it. Then for some reason I had this overwhelming feeling to just finish the book.. and I read it all that night. I could not put this book down.I never write reviews on books. I also never reread books... I have reread this book about 8 different times now... I absolutely love this book. I cant get enough of it.. John green is an amazing author,  he made me bawl during this book. Which does not happen.I recommend The Fault in Our Stars to everyone, even if you don't care for reading. It will make you cry, it will break your heart, you will get mad, but you will love every second of it!!I cant force you to read it, no one can, but if you don't you will miss out on the amazing heartfelt story that is The fault in our stars.. so if you take anything from this review, it is READ THIS BOOK!!!"
5," John Green, the author of The Fault in Our Stars, does not romanticize the experience of having cancer as many books do-he approaches it with a realistic attitude though his characters, and makes it relatable for anyone. But what Green really does wonderfully is examine the quirky, beautiful, terrible, and over all enigmatic hearts of humans. He is able to make people recognize the amazing truths of what our hearts contain, all while telling a story; a story about a girl with cancer and a boy with a prosthetic leg who fall in love, with America's Next Top Model, a story of a tulipman, champagne, certain half-deserted streets, blind-guy video games, a completely mad and yet unbelievably wise old writer, and a very important notebook thrown in as well. And it turns out that all these things, when put together, create a wonderful novel.DFTBA."
5," There was such hype behind this book and I disregarded it at first; not being into the teenage romance types. Then I thought of The Twilight Series. Teenage Vampires? Wolves? heh..no. Then a friend begged me to just read the first chapter.Hooked. I became completely enthralled in the impossible. This is why I gave The Fault In Our Stars a chance. This one is obviously based on realistic situations. I definitely connected wish Augustus Waters, the reason..I have none. I just liked him.However, the chapters focusing on the Amsterdam Trip had me skimming and skipping. I know the trip and whole idea of them falling in love perhaps because of the connection they had with the characters in the book.I just think there could have been less words. Not the book I expected but still worth the read. I just kinda feel guilty that I'm not in a puddle of tears like so many I know we're after reading."
5," This is a quick read but one I found very worthwhile. In some ways, it's a fairly predictable teen love story written for young adults. Girl meets boy, they hit it off, they have a romantic adventure and fall in love.  The twist here is that both of our protagonists are cancer patients.This is a story about what it is like to love someone you know is dying.  What it is like to be someone who is dying, and still have the courage to fall in love.  What I appreciated most about the story was that John Green mostly gets it right.  The desire to just be normal, or at least as normal as possible.  The worry about how your situation affects others.  The truth that to love someone, and be loved by them is a gift and a privilege no matter how long it lasts.  The truth that some people just aren't up to it, and that others don't have any choice.  I've been there and I can tell you that this book rings true."
3," The cancer experience was remarkably well documented. The writing is on target.  I was a young adult cancer patient 36 years ago.  Survival projections were 85%, very good for cancer in those days.  Treatments were brutal.  I was asked to help others going through the experience.  Young people with the same type and initial staging had relapses and some did not survive.  I was a young married adult; I tried  to keep trauma away frommy children and family.  Surgeries and weight loss, hair loss all obvious issues, so neighbors and teachers told my girls their Mom was dying unbeknownst to me.  Prognosis after treatment:  5 year test then they projected a possibility to make it to age 45.  I am far beyond my death sentence after many surgeries and related damage traumas.  Grateful for the time to have another daughter and meet my grandchildren.  The book was just hard for me to read.  Too tragic."
5," This is a wonderful but difficult book.  I fell in love with the characters in pretty much record time - they are just so charming, you won't be able to help yourself.  But just as quickly as you fall in love with them, you know that things won't end well - and you dread what will happen to your new friends.  You'll read the book quickly, because it moves fast and the prose is witty and smart (why can't I be that awesome when I speak?!?), but you also get more and more afraid of what you're going to find out as you keep reading.  As a parent, I found myself identifying most with the moms and dads in the story (a statement more about where I am in my life than anything else) but it's pretty hard to find a character you won't like and root for and hope for (even the one you think you don't you will a bit, just wait).Real, hard, full of suffering and love and hope and setbacks - what a great book."
5, actually cried several times during this book. I just can believe  how good this was. Augustus will forever be in our hearts.
2,"nteresting, thought provoking and complex...take the time to read this fictional story it gives all of us a new point of view."
5, bought this for my Granddaughter and she loves this book.My Daughter is reading it now and then it's my turn. Thanks so much.
5, was expecting a much more interesting book based on the reviews. This is simply another Airport Book in my opinion.
5, Great read. Have tissues ready throughout the book. Really made me stop and think and appreciate my healthy children even more.
2,"t's the kind of book that could be cheesy. Instead it's just brilliant, witty and never self indulging. Definitely recommended"
5, John Green knows how teenagers think and understands the tragedy of young love that in this story has a very unfortunate twist.
4," Captivating from start to finish. I never imagined a story about cancer could be so filled with hope-driven, beautiful vitality"
5, read this book in tandem with my daughter. We both loved the character's and fresh voice of the story. Could not put it down!
5, this book was amazing and i can't wait til the movie comes out I'm extremely satisfied with this book and i highly recommend it
5," Perfect balance of emotion- from laughter to sarcasm, and love to sorrow. A book for all ages. Going to be one heck of a movie!"
2, Loved it..great writing a year sticker but totally worth it. It will come highly recommended to others. Can't wait for the next
4,t was such an amazing story. I was crying basically the whole time while reading it. This is definitely my favorite story now!
5, An excellent book that gives you a teenager's insight on what a Cancer patient feels and the way their dreams are not deterred.
5, This book was really good and I would definitely recommend it to read. Definitely cried during this book but it's a great read.
5," This is a truly wonderful book. John green has done it again, managing to have a great plot but an ending I wish was different."
5, sobbed like a baby through most of the book..I am making my English teacher friend and my teenage daughter read it..thank you
5," Willard you cry your eyes out, but makes you put things into perspective. Very well written with a very lovable main character."
5, John Green is a great writer!  I could see his wit and humor through out the book and yet feel the seriousness as well.  Bravo!
5, Such an amazing story! All of John Green's books are awesome and this one especially moved me. Be ready to get the tissues out.
5," The whole family loved this book. Great discussion material with our pre-teen. It should come with a box of tissues, however!!!"
2, The tears I shed while I read this book are emblematic of the kinds of feelings you might feel as I read this book. Read it :^)
5, This book was spectacular I recommend it to anyone who enjoys lifeI've never read a book that fast I couldn't put it down
5, Spring for the audio version. It's well done and so worth it! Endearing characters and a beautiful ending. Have Kleenex nearby.
5," A very good glimpse into teenager thinking and acting, as well as honest and insightful about living with illness. A good book!"
5, loved this book - it felt very genuine and real to me. The characters are wonderfully written and the storyline is well done.
5, The fault in our stars is a inspiring novel about Hazel an her struggle through cancer. then she falls tragically in love......
5, John green is awesome...nothing else to say! ( I have to write 12 words worth of something to submit this)&lt; There is it is!
5," really enjoyed this book. I knew it would be really sad, it is about children with cancer after all, but it's also beautiful."
5, Truly captures a young mature love. Reminded me so much of Romeo and Juliet where their fighting families were more like cancer
5, One of the best books I have ever read...and I've read hundreds if not thousands over the years. It's a must read for everyone.
2," People had told me that this book was good, but I didn't realize it was  stay up till 4:00 am reading good. Highly recommend!"
5," could not put this book down- touching, honest, beautifully written. I would HIGHLY recommend it.  You won't be disappointed."
5, Love has no boundaries no pain no fault.  Compare to cancer its selfish does not care who it as attacks. Deep and to the point.
5," Still crying over this heartfelt, beautiful story. A definite must read for all. The Fault in Our Stars is an incredible story."
5, Dealt with tragedy but was strangely uplifting.  Loved the characters &amp; the way their story was related.  Couldn't put it down.
5," Refreshing that this book says what we are thinking. Live, live a life that leaves scars and don't be afraid to be the grenade."
5, This was an amazing book that got me both laughing and bawling throughout. Highly recommended to anyone who wants a great read.
5, This book is as touching as it is funny. I read it all in one sitting and stayed up till 5am to do it. By far my favorite book.
5, Cried for good for the first time in a long time. Thank you John.Not much else to say other than you should read this book.
5, John Green is an amazing author and the fan base he has made for himself among young adult readers is huge. Especially due to this youtube channels. I picked this book up after my fourteen year old son read it for the third time and kept insisting I read it. He and all his friends are huge John Green fans. I pick up the book and I read it from front to back. It is amazing and very enduring to the human spirit. The look he takes at cancer kids as he calls them and allows us to look inside their lives and struggles is very real even though this is a fictional story. He does not sugar coat what the characters are experiencing. I feel if anything reading this book will help people of all ages understand more what it is like for people struggling with any terminal illness and understand what their friends or family are enduring at that time. Just have tissues ready and lots of them because the tears will roll.
2," This book...oh, this book. What can I say here? Augustus is wonderfully romantic without being over the top, which many male characters are. Hazel is raw and a bit cynical, but I love her. I am not sure why she answered most questions with a question, as if she was unsure, but perhaps that was the point; she was a homebody afterall.The story here is so true to life, in that we all get a set number of days and it doesn't matter if we do something extraordinary, but that we find joy in our sorrows, laughter in our tears and experience the pain that makes us feel, even if it sucks.I sobbed...hard when I watched the movie, and just as hard reading the book after. The feelings you evoke, Mr. Green, are very powerful and for that I applaud you and give this a very enthusiastic 5 stars. I will be re-reading this book for years, perhaps even as often as Hazel read An Imperial Affliction."
5," put off reading this book for a long time because after reading the description, I thought it would be too sad and depressing. I'm so glad I finally decided to read it! Yes, the book is sad. But it's so much more than that. It's hilarious at times, it's witty, it's really deep, and, like a great book should, it engages all of the reader's emotions. I've read other reviews that say that the characters aren't realistic because of they way they talk and think at such a young age, but I wholeheartedly disagree. I can imagine that nothing in the world would mature high school kids quite as fast as having to face their own mortality. I felt the characters were realistic, honest, and refreshing. This book made me look at things differently, made me appreciate things more, made me understand that life is still beautiful even when it's not so beautiful. Loved it. Will read it again, and I definitely recommend."
5," My favorite part of this book was the characters, especially Hazel.  John Green does an absolutely impeccable job of developing characters that seem real without being average or dull. Another great part of this book is how bluntly cancer is represented. The characters themselves even make fun of “cancer cliches”.Throughout the book Hazel provides you with light, witty, humor, which is exactly what's needed when reading a book with topics as heavy and massive as child cancer patients.Overall there's not much negative to say about this book, as long as you know what you're getting into. The only negative reviews I've heard of this book are ones by people who don't like young adult novels, and people who don't like romance novels, and there's not much I can say to those people. I'd say give this book a chance, and I can almost guarantee you will find yourself completely obsessed until you finish it."
5," find that with the current Media available there is too much sex, too many drugs, too much alcohol and far too stupid people. John Green produced another book that reminds me of the intelligent youth. It tells the story of two intelligent youths put in the position where they are dying of cancer and turns into a romance that is rushed into the desperate need to be loved teenagers feel. The sex was sweet, non-graphic, and non-rushed as it should have been for a young adult novel. The love was real and the parents were depicted as intelligent loving caring people who were dealing with the very real situation of their children having cancer and the inevitable consequences of cancer. I give this book five stars without being a nerdfighter but knowing what they are. I read books, it's what I do and I enjoyed this one without compromise."
5," You cry and you laugh at the same time. Such a sweet story,I fell in love with the characters. Easy read, but hard to put down"
5," Well written.Recommend for the romantic .I will read more of books by the author, john Green.Thank you"
5," really enjoyed this book, after having seen the movie version. I think now I may have to check out Mr. Greene's other books!"

5," Very good book. Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down.  it was not as predictable as I thought it would have been."

2, This was a very emotional and enthralling love story! It touches my heart and soul. Read it for sure! Definitely a great book.

5," One of the Best books Ever! Loved it! Hope it wouldnt end!!!!! Loving-witty. Humourous. Must read, everyone. Love it, love it."
5,t's a great book.  I would reccomend this book. Be prepared to cry...a lot. It definitely changed my view of cancer patients.
2," This book was so well written! I couldn't put it down. The characters were so real, I felt like they were in the room with me."

5," read this at the insistence of my son.  I thought that it would be a quick read.  It was, but it was a wonderful story also."
5, cried. Undoubtedly the most fantastic book I have ever read. I cannot fathom what these teens go through. Very well written.
5," Well written, tender, and heartbreaking. You get very into the story, anyone will like this book.  Its an easy and quick read!"
2,t's like I became a teenager again with an infinite capacity for love even under the worse circumstances.  I loved that book.

5, This was an excellent read.  It felt like I became the character and felt her pain &amp; frustration. Very well written and simple

5," So many lessons on life and love !a beautiful,tragic story!! I want to 're - read this because there were so many life truths!"
5, This book is probably the best book I have ever read. Recommendations to anyone that likes to read absolutely fantastic books.
5," TFIOS is one of my favorite books of all time. This story touched me in ways that my heart never went.  The writing style was so perfectly voiced that you would never really know that a grown man was the author of this book, told from the perspective of a teenage girl. I loved the themes and imagery. I still hold many parts of this book as treasures in my memory, as though I was there watching My family underwent the tragic journey of adolescent terminally diagnosed cancer when my uncle was 15. Knowing this I recommended this book to my mom and she gave it to her mom. My mother, his sister, and my grandmother, his mother, all appreciated it not only for its accuracy in portraying a mother's concern for her child, but also how a child feels when they have no hope. I can speak for all three of us when I say: This book is a MUST READ. Also, keep a box of tissues at hand. Amazing job, John Green. DFTBA"
5," have to be really sincere: I found some of the books phrasing very difficult to understand. That doesn't in any way mean anything wrong, in fact, I found it very delightful to find such philosophical and deep sentences for two teenagers. I enjoyed the way feelings were put into the book, and I liked it so much I nearly cried in some parts.I felt that a message was trying to be transmitted to the reader, like what Augustus W said about Hazel G. So, is it a great book? Indeed it is. I would not hesitate for one second to recommend it. I had a hard time hooking to it at first, but once the story developed I found a way of staying connected to the story even when I was not reading. Also, I loved the way the author made the reader not feel PITY throughout the entire book. It makes you feel that you are reading a story about just two  teenagers.PS, it kinda makes you want to read AIA."
5," am writing this review as a young 14 year old who actually lives in Indiana.This book really affected me, changed the way I view the outside world. But how does one as an individual learn truth about the world without virtual and mechanical help (via. Google)? Well, there are various ways we can take upon ourselves but which most of the human race is too blinded to see what we have right in front of us. Now you're probably thinking, what does a 14 year old who uses logically words in the wrong context know about life or the Outside World? Well, that's the thing. I'm uneducated by all means of life. I live in a generation filled of technology and instagram.  Now you're probably thinking what the hell does this have to do with the book? Life isn't suppose to make sense nor is this. Well, just like Van Houten, life ends in the middle of a...  SINCERELY,  Brinton.Amber@Gmail.com"
5," think the reason so many people read this book is because it gave you such a new perspective.  It was a fresh look at the real reason people want to leave a mark. It's not always for them but for the people they love to never be able to forget them.  This book taught me so many things. Not only about life but about love and how it doesn't change you it reveals you. Augustus and Hazel are such inspirations. I would recommend this book to someone who is looking for a change. A way to cope with there problems by realizing that's some infinities are bigger than other infinities. Your problem may be big to you but it won't leave a mark in the grand scheme of things. This was an amazing book and of course I would hope for a sequel but I guess everything  really ended the way it should have, with nothing left unclosed. I would hope that everyone would read this book. It deserves to leave its mark."
2," This was probably one of the best books I have ever read. I was intrigued with the way Hazel and Gus felt towards each other and interested with how they spoke to one another. They showed affection with simple phrases and quotes from their favorite authors or poets. I was truly mortified when Augustus told Hazel he had a recurrence. I knew that one of them died, (my prediction was Hazel,) or that they both died together. It was a plot twist and if I must say so myself a good one. Yes of course my heart shattered when Augustus died, but I didn't cry. I could only feel the pain of Hazel. And I found myself feeling bad for them both, even though Hazel and Augustus hated that type of thing. I pictured Hazel being slim but elegant with how she carried herself about the world. I wanted Augustus to be the superhero that comes in and saves her, but it turns out that they seemed to have saved each other."
5," John Green seems to be loved by absolutely everyone I come in contact with, so by the time I got to the novel, my expectation was raised to that of Harry Potter or The Signature of all Things. I believe this is partly why I didn't enjoy it. It was written too simplistically, comparable to Suzanne Collins' train wreck. Simply another young adult book that is able to reach the masses with ease. Humans are united by common understanding, so naturally a simplistic novel that is easily understood by a large populace will go viral and get rolled into a multi-million dollar movie (Yet another thing to raise expectation). The point is, it is easy to publish a book, it's publishing something worth while that is the true challenge. This novel didn't do it for me. Being able to read a novel in a day is not pleasurable, I want to be part of the characters' lives for at least a week, not six hours."
5, :( I am disappointed in the ending in this book:( you are probably wondering why I gave this book 5 stars then. Well it is.because it is true. These things happen and not every book.have fairy tail endings. I know this. Gus was the last person I expected to die in this book however he did. I have to admit I am crying like crazy over this book. While this is not the happiest book it is my favourite book of all time! I am hoping you don't make a sequel. A sequel will just take attention away from this marvellous book. While I understand hazel will have more of a life after this but her life in this book is so well crafted that I can't imagine anything better and the sequel is never is as good as the original! However if you could make up a few letters or something Gus wrote to hazel in his last days that would be great! I think you are a wonderful author and hope you write more amazing books!!!!!
2," might be one of the only people on the planet that didn't fall madly in love with this book. The characters talked Dawsons Creek-style, and when I wasn't skimming long speeches, I was wondering if I had ever met a teenager who talked like them, much less two, and even less two with cancer that just happened to fall in love. At times, the book almost seemed like it was making fun of itself or its own genre though I doubt it was. It was just comical sometimes how unrealistic it all was, especially considering the serious nature of the book (the deep themes, the characters grappling with their own mortality, grief, etc). Don't want to give anything away so I'll stop there.I would recommend this book for anyone who is looking for an afternoon read. If you consider it the greatest love story ever told, you might want to read a few more books, but this one won't be a waste of your time."
5," This story was touching, funny, sad, and thought-provoking.I personally found the characters to be very believable. I know some reviewers thought that their dialogue was unnatural for teenagers, but me and my book-obsessed friends talked in similar non-teenagerish ways when we were that age. This is the story of a young girl with cancer, who is battling it with as much dignity as she can, although she doesn't have any long-term hope of recovery. (A bit of a spoiler alert- she doesn't die in the book, which was a relief to me. I'm not going to say it has a happy ending, but it didn't end on a depressing note.) She has accepted the reality of her death, but still lives her life to get as much happiness as she can. Her boyfriend is very likable, with his thoughtful analysis of everyday situations, and they make a very cute pair, who often had me laughing. I recommend this book highly."
3," The first John Green book I read (Looking for Alaska) wasn't really my cup of tea, so I held off a long time for this book.  However, after seeing endless accolades and fuss for both the book and the movie, I thought I would read the preview available on Amazon.  I was hooked immediately, and so I read the rest as soon as I was able (received book as bday gift).  Although the subject is kind of depressing, I appreciated how the teens just wanted to be treated as normally as possible, how they became friends and more, how cancer and being a grenade didn't have to be part of the equation (and this includes Isaac).  I like the parents, too - doing their best to hold it together, despite the circumstances.  Not a happy ending, exactly, but some relief from the heartbreak, at least.  A book with powerful emotions, as well as some humor.  John Green definitely wrote a winner with this one."
5," put off reading this book for quite a while because I had heard just enough about it to make me fear that the story would be one too difficult for me to finish.  As a parent, I am constantly plagued by fears for my children, and I believed that I wouldn't be able to appreciate the greatness that so many people claimed there was to be found in this story through the distraction of imagining one of my daughters in the role of the central character.  I was wrong not to have read this the first moment it came out, because it is one of the most intelligent and interesting books I have ever had the pleasure of reading.  There was no time to drift away to depressing thoughts of loss while traveling these pages, I was too swept up in the feelings of Hazel, too desperate to learn more about Augustus, and too impressed with the author's skill in weaving their story together to focus on anything else."
5," This is an amazing story. It's told by Hazel, sixteen years old and suffering from cancer. Naturally, many of her friends are fellow 'Cancer Kids' but far from being a gloomy book, the youngsters' attitude to their illness is wry, funny and very mature. There are some wonderful observations. People say they are battling cancer but as one pointed out, 'The cancer is me so it's a civil war.' Hazel says that they are the failed experiments in the mutations of evolution.The story could be depressing but it isn't. It's not over-sentimental but takes a deep look at what it is to love and how those who survive us manage to live with our absence. Hazel, Augustus, her boyfriend and Isaac, another of the Cancer Kids, are intelligent, witty, amusing and extremely lovable characters. It's excellent writing which can create these characters without resorting to schmaltz. A book everyone should read."
5," The Fault in Our Stars is the most beautiful book that I have read all year (and I read A LOT) .I loved how John Green has different layers to his writting. It's not a flat story,  he really does develop the character beautifully throughout the novel. While I was reading this book, I really felt like I was there with Hazel. I felt her pain and I felt her joy too.To me, what truly makes a fantastic book, is to make the reader feel something for the character.  And let me tell you, I was bawling and laughing for a good part of this book.I also appreciate that it's not just a book about love (like most books nowadays) it's also about something that most humans are afraid of :  Cancer.But it's not just about them (Hazel and Gus)  being sick,  it's that they had the courage to get out there and find love in  a situation that most people wouldn't even bother finding love in."
5, realize this was probably written for teenagers but it was just too unrealistic to enjoy.  I really don't get all the hype.
2, Very cute book. Lots of ups and downs.. would definitely recommend. I also like that it's a quick read. Finished it in a day.
1," Worth the laughs and the occasional tears- takes you on.  Journey with the characters,  you fall in love as they fall in love"
4, think everyone should read this book. It's a love story with humor and sadness. So many different lessons to take out of it

5, read this book it was beautiful and one of the only books that made me cry it was lovely and I recommend it for ages 12-112
4, BEST BOOK EVER MAKES YOU CRY BUT TOTALLY WORTH IT DEFINITELY RECOMMEND. Although it may have some bad scenes and curse words.
5," Emotional read, is a serious understatement. A love story of such tragedy that I was torn about finishing the book."
5, Great book for teens and young adults.  I read it in one day and couldn't put it down. The vocabulary in the book is amazing!
4, Great coming of age book. My teenage granddaughters read it and encouraged me to read it. I'm glad; very good book.

4," What a sad, beautiful story. It is so honest in its portrayal of pain in all its senses, and yet so full of love. Great read."
5, The most beautifully written and handsomely described book I've ever read. And you will cry but don't worry it's therapeutic.
5, Great book about a really serious subject but written in a way that is light and comical at times. Definitely recommend this!

5," This book was absolutely perfect. It was a sad and sweet love story. I'm in love with this book, there's no doubt about that."
5," A situation that is hard to imagine bringing any happiness or comfort, but it does. What brave young adults and wise parents."
2, This book will have a lasting effect on you if you have ever been loved or loved someone who is no longer with you.  Read it.
5, John Green skilfully captures the adolescents' feelings in this story about young people who come of age while facing cancer.
5," can't believe it's over, I wish it didn't have to end. This book has elements of true love, comedy and realism. I loved it!"
5, You immediately fall in love with the characters they come to life and you later fully feel the grief of their circumstances.
5," This book was beautiful and heartbreaking. You should seriously read this, and probably not in public. Bring out the tissues!"
5, absolutely loved this book. I need to read another book from this author. Just as soon as I reread this lovely work of art.
5, This was the first book of John Green's I read.  I thought it was so well written.  I plan to look for others he has written.
5, Good read. Easy to follow. You feel for the characters.  Might look into some of his other books. The price was a little high
5," Never have I cried for a book. John Green is one of my favorite authors, and wow. Just amazing. Everyone must read this book."
5, You will immediately fall in love with all the beautifully crafted characters.  A touching story you will want to hold close.
2, would recommend this book to anyone 15 or older.  I think it would appeal to the females. Funny and sad.  Great characters.
5," This is better than Looking for Alaska, a book that used to be my favorite until I read TFIoS. Keep calm and DFTBA everybody!"
5," am by no means a leisure reader. Usually dedicating the pre-bedtime hours to reading, I rarely get through a book less than a month before moving on to the next.But this.This right here.This captivated me enough to finish this book in two days. I've never read a book that I've been so enthralled with, and John Green has a way with words that is almost magical. The dialogue is believable, yet poetic. And while I'm no longer a teenager, I do recall a time when I excessively used big words in daily communication. Not so much anymore, resulting in looking up quite a few every chapter to remind myself the various meanings.I've also never highlighted so many sentences in a book that I felt were so incredibly thought-provoking.This book makes you laugh, makes you learn, makes you cry. It's a book about life and death that makes you feel."
5," was really excited to read this book. Many of my [younger] friends were talking about how great it was, there's a movie coming out, it's always on the best books lists...so it has to be a great book, right? Wrong. I won't go so far as saying that it was a terrible book. It was readable. I wasn't so bored that I quit reading, but I was very close a few times. There were a few sweet moments, and a few moments when I felt like I may shed a tear, but overall, I just didn't love it. When I hear such great things about a book, I expect to read it quickly and not want to put it down. I had to convince myself to finish this book in hopes that it would eventually become more interesting and maybe I'd find a part that made me actually want to keep reading.Overall, it's a sweet story with a depressing ending, but it does not live up to the reputation it has undeservingly earned."
5," After being by my husband's side through the diagnosis, chemo, radiation, and surgery of esophageal cancer (he is cancer free at this time), I can in many ways identify with this story.  All outcomes are so different but the many many patients, doctors, nurses, caregivers, friends, and pastors that became a part of our lives in some small way made an impact that touched us. All cancer patients want to be treated as they were prior to the big C. Love them, include them, invite them, and most of all Don't hover over them. Thank you John Green  for capturing in this story bits and pieces of what cancer patients face. With us we were never alone we had Christ with us. A dear friend gave us a Cross with the poem Footprints printed on it she told my husband when he felt so alone that Christ was carrying him. No matter what our religious beliefs, most of us believe in a God. Mine is Jesus Christ."
2," As someone with chronic illness I cannot convey in words how much this book connects with me on a level so deep it brought me to tears (I haven't cried over a book since I was 8). While my situation is significantly less dire than the characters here that you will come to love, there is something so complicated about being constantly ill and to see someone portray the unexpected trails in a way that is as amusing, and engaging as it is deep causes to truly feel understood, something I don't think I've felt ever. To John Green I give a strong, heartfelt round of applause. Thank you is as all I can say, you're mind's as beautiful as you pen. If you want to, as a healthy/normal person, to understand how people so young and frail can spout philosophy like it's their calling in life then read this book. It's the closest thing to truly understanding the situation short of experiencing it yourself."
5," My opinion is, put simply, this: I though that it was a boringly written book (barely any vocabulary and uninteresting dialogue and narration) with a cheesy love story. I was extremely disappointed because everyone built it up to be a lot more. I heard all the amazing things about how it was the best book ever etc., and I felt it did not live up to that expectation at all. It didn't do that because I felt like it was very simple and I could predict what would happen next. Everybody said it was like the new Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings. No, no, no. Not even close. But with that said, I have to admit that I did cry at some points. A few good things about it though: I loved how Hazel and Gus were intelligent. I hate it when people perceive sick people as stupid people. John Green was really on point with all of the arguments he made through Hazel and Gus. So that's my opinion. Okay? Okay."
5," Some people think that the way Augustus and hazel talk aren't realistic but that what makes them so hilarious this is my new favorite book love it so so so much I wish I had a Augustus in my life be I wouldn't want him to die on me over all am amazing book words can't explain how much I'm in love with this book I recommend this book to anyone that love books that are humorous, romantic, well crafted , and amazing . Words can't explain . I would have a box of tissues by you , I finish this in 2 hours once you pick it up u can't stop.Hazel is amazing , beautiful and strong I mean she has cancer and everything she been through. A true role modelAugustus sexy ,sexy Augustus. I love you and you're a fictional character . So talented and cute.I could write a book about this book , I love it so so so so so so so so much .Thank you so much for writing this John green"
2," A rebellious teen (Hazel) struggles with some of the harsh realities of life, dealing with cancer, love, relationships, and wondering what life is all about; and, by the way, where do you go when you die?  The questions that humans have pondered since the beginning of civilization.All Hazel (and we) can ever get is a glimpse of the truth from the Arts - the writers of poetry, song and literature, painters and sculptors, and from some place deep within ourselves.  And still the truth about reality remains forever beyond our ability to fully grasp.  And to Hazel, the world has too many  people who say they know the truth, think they know the truth, but are charlatans, full of lovely but empty words.Ultimately Hazel can only find peace in the acceptance of undeniable fate, and that life will always remain a mystery to be experienced rather than a problem to be solved."
5, knew the moment I finished the first page that this book would be amazing. it's just beautiful and tragic and bittersweet.
2," Great book, read it in one sitting.  Cannot wait for the movie but kinda scared too - movies are never as good as the books!"
5, What a beautifully written book. I finished it in less than a week. It's an easy read but one you don't want to miss out on.
5, Such an amazing and well written book.The author really lets you into the mind of the person afflicted.Loved it!
5, This book is amazing though sad and painful it was written so well and it is must read. I am having everyone I know read it.
5," Love it. Great, unique read! Even though it's about two young kids with cancer, it was inspiring! I would recommend to most."
5," Amazing! This was probably the best book I've read in my life, no exaggerations. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone"
5, love this book! The story is so moving. It gives you insight into how people with cancer feel about how others treat them.
5, Cannot wait til the movie. This was s quick read it was so good! Get your tissues ready. However I wish the book was longer.
5," This book is very addicting,sad, inspirational at moments, and more! I can't wait for the movie to come out! Very good book!"
5," Tear jerker, but great love story. This story shows some love is over a short span instead of years. Couldn't put it down :)"
2, Overall this was a good book if you like to be sad and depressed.  I guess it depends on what your personal preferences are.
5, may not be well read but I read a lot. The Fault in Our Stars is the best literature I have had the pleasure of taking in.
3," loved the characters in this book, but more than that I loved the words. It is beautifully written an elegant my composed."
5, This was well worth the time. Good story and great characters. Interesting to get cancer patients perspective on their life.
5," Great book. Hazel...Thank you for teaching me more about beauty,Gus you loved Hazel and that portraying of love was amazing."
5," absolutely loved this book, I consistently found myself becoming emotionally attached to the characters. It is a must read"
5," A awesome book. For the last half, I couldn't stop crying. Be sure to not read somewhere public where you don't want to cry."
5,t was a great short read very emotional and sweet. its definitely a young adult/teen read i will recommend to my book club.
5," John Green's writing is fantastic. The story is touching and full of heart. You need to read this book, you won't regret it."
5, cried. A lot. But I really enjoyed the characters. The banter and conversation was enjoyable. The love story was so sweet.
2, This book touched my heart and soul deeply. A must read for young adults and adults alike. You won't be able to put it down!
5, Perfectly written by using quotes from books within books with the stories that so infallibly align the scars on our hearts.
5, This book was amazing. I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for something comedic or romantic or dramatic to read.
5, This was one of the best books I have read in a long time. I recommend everyone to read it. It literally brought me to tears
5, This book was great!  I couldn't put it down.  Their sense of humor intrigued me.  I would definitely recommended this book!
5, can not even read a bad review about this book--it's perfect! I cried and cried (like MOST everyone else who has read it!)
5," awesome beautifully written and deeply touchingit changed my way of the world, of love, and of how I see other people."
5," Really makes you stop and appreciate life. This book is so well written; makes you laugh, cry and think. I highly recommend."
5, really loved the way this book was written. Makes you think differently if you're having a bad ..... It won't seem so bad.
5, Omg. I hate reading and this is the BEST book ever. I have never read so much in my life. Finished this book within a day &lt;3
2, My friend read their said it was Amazing and WOW it was breath taking and such a wonderful story and by far my favorite book
5," A wonderfully amazing little love/life story! Definitely one of my most favorite reads of all time, and that's no easy feat."
5, didnt know anything about this book when it was assigned to us for my book club. I finshed it in 2 days. Amazing
5," so sad but so loving, best book.  have ever read.  i love augustus waters so much. hazel is the most reasonable person ever."
5," Not your classic struggle with cancer book, but it is a wonderful story. It is sad but it is also heartwarming and wonderful"
5," Came in almost perfect condition, a tint fold in the back but that didn't matter! Came promptly and I can't wait to read it!"
5, This book was truly awe inspiring. It was incredibly well written and emotionally trying. I'd recommend this book to anyone.
5," This is truly a testament to how heartbreaking (and heartwarming) life can be...and us for a lot of people. Hazel Grace Lancaster, our heroine(?), but I use that term loosely, because Hazel and Augustus both expressed form stances on how they felt about cancer survivors being made out as saints or heroes. Still, Hazel is brave considering how strongly she faces the trials her cancer puts her through, be it physically, mentally, spiritually or emotionally. I admire how both Hazel and Augustus choose to live while dying (their little infinity).Aside from that, the humor in this book was both unexpected and welcome. There were times I literally laughed out loud; J.G. knows how to balance the comedy and blunt reality of life and death. He never waded into the Waters (wink, wink) of cheesy young adult cliches. Truly a sad, yet realistic take of love, laughter and loss."
5,"ve never read a romance before but this one, was not as typical as you'd think. I expected it to end like most romances do; they fall madly in love...the end. But it didn't end exactly like that which was refreshing. I mostly read this because it was highly recommended and totally overrated, but somewhat worth it. the only downfall is the fact that it dragged itself out and had so much time consuming fillers inside of it that you can't do anything but hope that it gets to the point quicker. Needless to say, I will be watching the movie adaption of this book because it wasn't too boring and when it got to the point I was slightly hooked and very emotional while reading it. That's what made reading it worth the time.BTW: I think Augustus's character was annoying sometimes and Hazel was somewhat pretentious majority of the book which was really annoying. You'll see if you read it."
5," All the reviews I read about this book said it was one of the finest love stories ever and that the fact that the main characters had terminal cancer was secondary to the story. I find it a bit pretentious to market this book this way, specially when there is not a single paragraph where the oxygen tank of the main character doesn’t get mentioned (she even has a name for it). So how can someone possibly forget that the kids are dying from cancer?Aside from that, this is a classic love story about a couple of kids who have cancer. I don't know if teenagers have really those deep thoughts, but maybe having a terminal disease gives you this kind of insight. It is believable that kids with a terminal disease would have this kind of concerns about life, death and the world.Nice read, although very predictable story. Not award-winning, this-book-changed-my-life kind of material."
2," have never written a review before. However, this book is special to me. I don't have a serious disease or anything but I really loved this book. I noticed lots of people tell a basic outline of the plot when they review books, but I don't think I will. Instead I will try to explain why I read this book. Lots of people at my school read this book and loved it, but considering the people at my school... I was quite unsure if I would actually like it. This is a book that I would tell anyone to read. I think the few people who gave this book a lower rate did so because they thought it was to sad or should have been more about the cancer. Personally I don't understand this, if they wanted a happier book or a book more about cancer than they should have read a different book. Anyway I really loved the book and my only complaint is that it will be hard to find a book better than this one."
3," This was a very well-developed, provocative novel that asks its readers to consider all of the ramifications of knowing what it is like to be a teenager, who has been diagnosed with cancer and a dire prognosis for recovery.  Knowing their lives will most likely be shortened and their hopes and dreams never realized, they find solace and meaningful relationships in a youth support group at their church.  The novel is poignant, told from a teenagers' point of view and with a sardonic edge to their dialogue, typical of adolescents' speech.  Their fears, frustrations and desires cover the whole spectrum of emotions, as they realize their time is short, and they must live in the moment.  Yet the story is full of love, hope and empathy for one another, as they learn to deal with loss and prepare themselves to face their own deaths.  The Fault In Our Stars is a novel one will never forget!"
5," admit I read this because my daughter loved it.  I mean- really loved it-and very passionately begged me to read it.  I enjoy reading books she loves because it gives us so much to discuss.  That being said, it was very easy to understand WHY my almost 14 year old daughter loved this story.  The character of Hazel is so well written, she is SUCH a teenager, that kids can’t help but get her.  And add to that the gallant, smart, slightly disrespectful but still nice Augustus Waters.  Who wouldn’t love this guy??  Even Hazel’s parents like him.  I know that almost everyone out there has already read and reviewed this, so I won’t go into the story, except to say it was wonderful, romantic, funny, and extremely sad.  If you haven’t already, please read this book as soon as you can.  And let me know how you liked it!(and if you have a 14 year old daughter, get her this book)"
5," This story is told from the point of view of Hazel, a teenager who knows from day one of her diagnosis that she is going to die. There is sadness, yes, as well as laughter and a great insight into a teenager's resilience to suffering, and to teenagers in general who don't die but are no longer bothered by their parents.In spite of being attached to an oxygen tank day and night Hazel finds love with Augustus who has lost a leg but has an 80% chance of survival. She also befriends Isaac who loses his second eye to cancer but will live.I found that the book dragged slightly about a third of the way in (probably an over egging of the awful situation the kids found themselves in) and the book dragged on a couple of pages after it ended. In spite of these quibbles it is an enjoyable read and well worth the time spent.John McAllister - Avid reader and novelist."
4, By far this was one of the most amazing books I have yet to read. It's ability to create an entire universe full of intricate ideas and complex algorithms of fate that entertained to create the complex story that was 'a fault in our stars' amazed me. The emotion conveyed by the characters and the atmosphere created by their personality left me in awe as I came to the end of the book. As I sit here with the tears i shed because of this story not even dry upon my face I ponder what could have brought about such a story within the mind of a person and I must say that John green is an extraordinary individual. Although I have not yet read any other works by this man I can tell already that the literary art crafted by the amazing mind of mr green may be just as magnificent  In the story's simplicity lies the true art and what made this book one of the best I have ever laid my eyes upon.
5," This is the first book I've read by John Green.Wow.. Just wow.One of the BEST BOOKS I've EVER read. EVER.It was so beautiful that I fell in love with it.It made me LAUGH.It made me SMILE.It made me CRY. (I just can't help crying.)What an emotional roller coaster.It was achingly beautiful!If you want a book that will make you cry, this is for you. Make sure you have something to wipe your eyes. Just in case you cry or weep. :)I love Hazel Grace Lancaster. For having a curious mind and a loving lady to Augustus [ till his last breath. :((( (hide spoiler)]I love Isaac. For making me laugh, especially that trophy smashing. I love his sense of humor.and of course..I LOVE AUGUSTUS WATERSHe's funny, sweet, cheesy and brave. Gosh he's a beautiful man with one leg."
5," loved that he tugged at my heart strings to make me feel something for these fictitious people. Even though in my mind it was real. The love, happiness, &amp; pain. There is nothing in this book that I dislike. I'd recommend this book to everyone I know because I did already. I rated it a 5 because it was well written and was the first book to make me cry like a little kid again. I'm glad that he was able to fit every detail into a book that I finished in 3 nights. This is not only the first book to make me cry, but actually make me get dragged into the emotions and keep reading it. I loved it and hope that even though many people have decided to watch the movie and never read the book are missing out on so much more. If john green reads this I'd love to say that I love this book and once I read your other books I hope they are as detailed and emotion packed as this one. Thank you."
5, loved it!!!! The Fault In our Stars showed me to love the little things I may only be 14 but this book means a lot to me.
2, And it was the only book to have ever made me cry. because you feel you are Hazel or Gus at some point and it's all so real
5, Heartfelt and touching. A chorus of words and a vocabulary masterpiece. I can't wait to see the movie. Thank you John Green
5, really enjoyed this book. nearly a box of tissue needed for the last few chapters. Augustus &amp; Hazel- what a relationship!
5," Will change your perspective on life. Beautifully written and always engaging, a book for all ages and all types of people."
4, Agonizingly wonderful. This book left me a sobbing mess for the last 200 pages; this likely intended struggle was worth it.
5," loved every gritting, passionate and romantic part of this book. Grabs your attention from page one. A must read for all."
5,f you're in the crying mood read this book! I loved it!!! I couldn't stop the tears from coming and I never cry in books!!
5, completely loved this book. It has hope. Even though I cried it is just an amazing story. I cannot wait for the movie ;))
5, could not put this one down. Simply beautiful and very well-written. I fell for the characters and am sad to see them go.
5, Very good book. I found it hard at times to put it down. It was hard to read about Cancer I a child especially being a mom.
2,t a great story! makes you fall in love and realize that life should be enjoyed every minute. heartbreaking but so lovely.
4," loved this book, it is simply amazing the love between Gus and Hazel was truly amazing the author's perspective was amazing"
5," Such a great book, and really makes you grateful for what you have. Definitely worth the read and its an easy read as well!"
5, To say this book is amazing is an understatement. Couldn't put it down. Life-changing book that I already adore. Must read.
4, was mesmerized from beginning to end of this book.  John Green is an amazing writer who brought young characters to life.
5, Get ready for a tear jerker!!!!Best book I've ever read!!! I recommend it to anyone and everyone!!! Best book ever!!!
5, had seen how cancer affect people's life. It was a great good what you did. He was able to mix reality with a love story.
5, liked the book.A lot.You should read it sometime.When you're not busy with life.Have a great day.
5," This a great story of a teenage girl dealing with cancer in a very teenage way. A real page-turner, I couldn't put it down!"
5," loved the characters, Augustus and Hazel. Their love story was so sweet. Have tissues on standby when you read this book."
2," have no regrets from reading this book. With its publication, the brilliant John Green is an author on a whole new level."
5, This book was beautifully written and had me in tears both happy and sad. Shows true strength and love.  I loved this book.
5, This book is amazing. Witty and devastating. You need to go buy this book and read it immediately. Seriously though.DFTBA
5," picked up this book yesterday without a doubt in my mind, from what friends had told me about it, that I was in for an experience. However, I was not truly prepared for what happened to me the moment I finished this wonderful concoction of literary brilliance. I found myself again. I wasn't depressed. All the stuff I bottled up for the last five years just faded into the nether. I'm happy. Not faking it like I was when no one knew. I even was inspired to finally begin my own novel which I've been fighting myself to write for eleven years. After reading The Fault in our Stars, I felt like a million stars exploded from head to toe and I just... Changed. I haven't been touched by a book like this since Phillip Pullman's His Dark Materials series. I couldn't be happier that I chose to purchase this, and the experience is one I will refuse to forget for as long as I live."
5," could not put this book down!  I felt every possible human emotion -- from laughing to crying. This book is amazing. It took me on an emotional roller coaster and in the end, it gave me an new found appreciation for life but also an appreciation for the fact that my three boys are healthy. We never know what life is going to throw at us BUT we always need to remember that there are people in this world that face every day challenges that we could NEVER imagine in our own lives. John Green has joined my very exclusive list of favorite writers which includes Stephen King and Pat Conroy. I'm planning to read EVERY book that John Green has written as I did with Stephen King and Pat Conroy. You cannot go wrong with this book and I would recommend it to ... oh, EVERYONE!  It was absolutely enthralling and I'm looking forward to reading all and any books that John Green has written."
5," The Fault in our stars is simply incredible. Well, at least incredible enough to make me write the first review I ever did, and I've been reading books for years and years, from fiction to non fiction.The one thought I had when I finished the book was that this was just so real. When you read the book you feel like you are there with the characters. The characters are so deep and interesting that it is easy to get lost and just read the entire thing in one day (that happened to me and English isn't even my mother tongue!).No matter how much I will say, it will not be enough to describe the amazing experience which is The fault in our stars.I hope you'll take the time to read it, and then read it to your kids, and they will read it to their kids.That amazing."
5," really did not like the book. I am so upset that I didn't. I honestly went in expecting to adore this. But I thought the philosophies of the people struggling with cancer and impending death was not genuine and I didn't care that the main character was going to die someday.  I liked the personality of Augustus. But not one of these kids spoke like a modern day human being. They spoke like they came from another time period.  I get the point that they were supposed to be more grown up, as they are facing death and forced to grow up early... but it didn't feel... legit.  The dialogue was too researched and intelligent for average adults.  These kids spoke like literature professors throwing teenage tantrums. It was not believable.  And I am not a fan of the girl they cast in the movie. (which I have not seen.)  So I kept picturing her through the book. erg. Thanks Hollywood."
5," This book is literally the nicest and saddest book I have ever read. This book will leave you in tears!!!! I read this book when it first came out, so it wasn't a big deal like it is now. When I was reading it, I thought everyone would get their happy ending &amp; live happily ever after, or something like that. Boy, was I wrong! This book took a twist and turned it around. I literally couldn't believe the ending! By the time I got to the last two pages,my eyes were filled with water and I couldn't read. I had to put the book down, and wipe away my tears, so I could read. At first, I was mad at John Green for the way he ended the story but then I realized; Not all books could have happy ending, some have to end a specific way, so everything can connect.I would totally recommend this book to anyone! This book will make you laugh,smile,&amp; cry.This book was just amazing!"
2,"m an adult, so I'll review from the adult side.  This was a beautiful book in many ways.  First, although we knew we were dealing with characters with serious illnesses, the focus was not all on the nitty gritty of what they had to endure.  We were spared the constant descriptions of most of what happens on the physical journey through cancer.The young characters were easy to know and love.  Although they were mature beyond their years, they were also vulnerable young people, who were dealing with life and death every day.  The adult characters, I think, were poorly developed, but perhaps they were intended to remain in the background.  We really had no insight into any of the parents outside from their relationships with their sick children.This is a book that is not at all graphic and is sad, rather than depressing.  I think it's a job well done!"
5," What do you say about a book that changes you? Firstly, John Green is an absolutely amazing author. This was the first book I have read by him and I know it will not be the last. He has a way with words that makes me practically sick thinking I'll never be quite that good. He is witty, captivating, and humbling. His characters, including the secondaries, are amazing. The primaries are incredible, but it is almost more moving thinking about the others.If you read this book, you will cry. The sadness takes a back seat only because of the wonder of being able to put yourself in the position of the characters. There was a point I was reduced to sobbing only thinking of what it would be like to be Hazel's mother.Just amazing. I recommend reading in one sitting while by yourself. I am appreciating the sunshine, the taste of food, and just everything a little more now."
2," personally think that this book is amazing! Hazel Grace Lancaster is not your typical teenage girl, she has cancer and has to carry (or wheel) around an oxygen tank to help her breathe. Hazel and Augustus had an amazing friendship and constantly had me thinking about what would happen next. My favorite part was when Hazel was reading a letter from Augustus at the end of the book, this part was so thoughtful of Augustus and their relationship was just amazing. Hazel and Augustus stayed loyal to each other throughout the course of the story. Weather tears or joy and laughter or sadness, there was not a time that I didn't cry while reading this story. This book is very dynamic, and keeps the readers attention on the book at all times. After reading this book, I realized that you just have to live life while you have it because you never known what could happen the next day."
5," am a 63 year old grandmother of four, and I don't usually read teen books, but my thirteen year old granddaughter talked about it so much that I decided to see what it was all about.  I actually saw the movie first and THEN I read the book.  I don't usually do that, but in this case I think it was a perfect choice.  The movie was wonderful, but the book had more depth as far as their true feelings were concerned. Having lost parents, in-laws, aunts, uncles and finally my own husband to cancer, I was very moved by this book.  I almost think it is more for adults than teenagers, but I understand the magic of the love story between Hazel and Augustus and how that appeals to the younger generation. That said, I thought the perspective of the actual cancer patients was brilliant.  It puts terminal illness in a whole new perspective and I would recommend this book to all ages."
5," So good. Cried a PT. Couldn't put it down. Highly recommend. Great love story and so, so sad. Can't wait to see the movie."
5, This book is so so well written and such a beautiful beautiful story. A must read for everyone who loves a good love story
5, loved the book and can't wait for the movie to come out. Plus thank u for giving me a different view of cancer and love.
5," had heard about the story and the movie coming out about this book, it is marvelous, wonderful story, touching and real."
5, Heartbreaking and beautiful. I loved everything about this boon and couldn't put it down. I'm so heartbroken that it ended
5, This was a heartbreakingly funny story.  It really shows an understanding of the cancer patient think.  I loved this book.
5," Very touching and amazing, I fell in love with this book and really enjoyed it!!! Highly recommend to young adult readers!"
5, All kinds of emotions reading this book - my 15 year old daughter read it and recommended it to me and so glad she did!!!!
2, Very touching love story causing me to think about our simple blessings. Brilliant writing but not for the faint of heart.
5, am sitting here crying because this book was aLL GOOD. GENIUS AUTHOR. I recommend this to teens and young adults(:
5, This is the BEST book I've ever read. Absolutely love love  loved it! !!! Definitely get this book totally worth the money
5, Very touching story.  It will make you think...it will make you cry...it should help you to appreciate good health.  Amen.
5, Best. Book. Ever.  I love John green! Even though all his books make me cry! Highly recommend this book! All of his books!

5," Great book, I love the point of view and where the story takes you. I loved it. A great read but keep the tissue close by."
5, A gripping easy read. I fell in love with the characters and just couldn't put it down. Be prepared to cry uncontrollably.
5, Very touching and relevant to all cancer survivors. I would recommend this book to anyone who has been affected by cancer.
2," read this book in an hour, and I am currently reading it for the fourth time...I love John Green completely. Okay? Okay."
5, This book is so heartfelt and has so many genres I truly enjoy. I can definitely see me reading this book over and over!!!
5," This was a wonderful, thought provoking, and emotional book. You need to read this! Don't hesitate. Rock on nerd fighters!"
5, John Green is a genius. I'm in love with this book. It will make you cry an ocean though. Hazel is the sweetest character.
5," What a beautiful story, I really enjoyed the take on young people having cancer. Very envious of their positive attitudes."
5, would suggest it to anyone who is interested in good literature. It's simply the best book I've ever read read . Period.
5, Keeps you engaged. Great for anyone experiencing a loss or illness. It resonated with me and know it will touch your soul.
5,"f anyone could make a book about teenagers with cancer funny and not too morose, it's John Green. This book is fantastic."
5," This book was one of the best books I have read. It was sweet. Heart warming, and emotional. I promise you will love it!!!"
5," really love this book! Great story that keeps you wanting to read it until it ends. Now, I know why it's a 5 stars book."
2, This book is tragic and heart warming. Such a wonderful love story. I liked how it did not sugar coat the idea of illness.
5," This story kept me interested until the last page.  Sad yes, but very very well written. The characters were true to life."
5," loved this book so much!! It is a inspiring love story, with a tragic twist. Thank you John Green, for warming my heart."
5,t was a great book and easy to read.  I couldn't put it down.  I would highly recommend to young adults and adults alike.
5,"ve never had a book that impacted me this much. I can only say, it is a must read. Just prepare yourself for some tears."
5," this book is a book filled with tears laughs anger and so much more. the auther john green gave tge most unexpected plot twist ever in history. he made love hazel and gus, they touched my heart and as gus did to hazel, they both left scars on my heart. tgis book will always be my favorite, my life. this is the story of an epic love story between a girl who was insecure about herself and wanted to die but didnt want to leave her parents alone, and a boy that had half a leg, alot of charisma, and a huge heart. these two people are hazel and augustus. thus book is perfect and i would not change a thing about it. the author made me hang on to every word. so thank u, john gree. u gave me a book that gave me a little infinitie, a book that made me realize that anything js possible, finding the love of ur life is possible, and. finding an infinty in a number of days,is possible."
5," First of all this book is beautifully written. The characters are very real and thestoryline moves quickly and rationally.I had never considered what dealing with a terminal illness would be like from theperspective of a young adult/teenager. Death and illness are always tragic, buthow does a sick teenager relate to healthy kids who typically feel they are invincible?I appreciated being led through a scenario of setbacks, hopes and dreams with limitedyet unknown time frames, and what's futile and what's not. How do sick kids deal with parentswho are sacrificing everything to keep their child alive and as normal as possible?This book opened my eyes to struggles I pray I never have to encounter, but awakenedme to the dismal but also potentially joyful realities of others' fights with terminal disease."
5, This book needs purpose. One star because I got through it. It's so depressing and goes no where with the story.
5," think that there are a lot of reasons why this book became a bestseller all over the world. I guess that the biggest reason is that this book isn’t just an ordinary cancer story. This story isn’t just about two teenagers who both have cancer and who fall in love, it is so much more than that and very important: it’s not predictable.I really like the style of writing of John Green a lot. It’s very relaxing to read; it’s really easy to understand everything and to follow the story. This writer uses a lot of beautiful metaphors and quotes in his books and I really appreciate that. In my opinion, this makes the book The Fault in our Stars so much better.I give this book 4 stars because I really liked this book and I think that everyone should read it, but personally I prefer another theme, like for example the theme from his book Looking for Alaska."
5," Love this book! The plot isn't particularly unexpected, but the writting is witty, cunning, and entertaining from the first word to the last. There are plenty of laughs to be had, and quick quips are in no short supply.  The true wonder of this book is not necessarily in the plot or in the characters, though they are both well-done, but in the writing itself. The best way I can put it is to say that it's a tragic, romantic story that is NOT depressing and is NOT sappy. It's refreshingly real and leaves you with a lingering, guilt-free, life-must-go-on-being-appreciated feeling.  All-in-all, a definite must read for all ages!P.S. If you're a screening parent, YES there are intimate moments, including one sex scene. There are no explicit details in the scene, and it is described in causal terms such as having condomy problems."
2," would read this book a million more times if I could ! The Fault in our Stars by John Green is an astonishing book about true love and the obstacles faced when living with an un curable illness. The main characters are Hazel Grace Lancaster and Augustus Waters. The authors ability to characterize is great. You really understand the characters personality and you start to fall in love with them. John Green is able to build tension and interest. The love story is just so amazing that you just want to keep reading. Also the author suprises you with the turning point of the story. There are so many details that you can actually visualize everything and live in the moment with the characters. I would definitely recommend this book to everyone. So, if you want to read the love story of Hazel and Augustus and find out how their relationship ends read The Fault in our Stars."
5," love a good YA romance especially one with star crossed lovers. The book was fast paced from the time I started reading it I did not want to put it down. And much to my family's dismay I did not put the Kindle down for 24 hours. I even forgave the author for the horrible names he gave his characters. They were all way too romanticesque. My two star review however is based on the fact I hated the ending. I feel as if I need to write John Green a letter and say, end your book. We were set up in the beginning as soon as Hazel starts explaining why she is obsessed with An Imperial Affliction. It was pre-determined how it would end. And yet I kept reading. And then it ended. It just ended. There was no closure. I understand that death does not always bring about closure but this is a book. A book with no sequel. A book that I will now have to imagine my own ending to."
5," With a good writer, I can usually find two or three passages in a novel that make me stop and think. John Green accomplishes with The Fault in Our Stars something which seems inhumanly possible - he supplies jaw-dropping thought, dialogue, narrative, and observation on every other page. For a writer to hold The Fault in Our Stars as an example of what we strive to achieve is to reach for the stars in our own work. Green stares down the ugly reality of living with terminal Cancer - both from the perspective of those who have it and those who must live with those who do with forthright honesty. This novel is nothing less than a handbook for looking at the meaning of life and how to distill the worthless part of our lives from the important ones. How many times do we see the words must read associated with a novel? This one takes first prize."
2," OK SO. I wonder if anyone will actually read this but I know I should hate John Green for killing Augustus off. And for existantially making me cry and crushing my soul. But I'm not. I'm really not. Which is a beyond pleasant surprise. And this entire book in itself, is a pleasant surprise. I love the wittiness. And I love how the words make me think. Instead of just flying through this book feeling, I don't know, feeling all the sorts of things you're supposed to feel when reading a tragic love story of the type, I actually read. I really and truly read it. It made me think about each and every word and phrase. And it made me feel in ways you weren't supposed to because God knows no one can tell you what to feel. So yea. That's my review. And if you read this great. I probably sound incredibly deranged but that's what happens when you finish a John Green book at 5 AM."
5," Hazel is a sixteen-year-old girl with terminal cancer who has become depressed and largely cut herself off from life, that is until she meets Augustus, a seventeen-year-old boy who’s lost his leg to cancer and meets her at a support group for teens with cancer. Now this sounds like a really depressing read from the description, and I had put off reading it for some time for that very reason, but I finally tackled it, and though there are inevitably some sad parts, the overall feelings I got from the book is strength, hope and taking full advantage of the present. Hazel and Augustus, despite their medical problems/diagnoses, have a very normal teenage courtship, and even with all the heavy issues they are dealing with, I think that really comes through. Both Hazel and Augustus were such fun, quirky characters, you can’t help but get wrapped up in the story. Great read!"
5," can barely describe all the angles from which I loved this book. As an avid reader of young adult books, as a writer of young adult fiction, and perhaps most personal, as the mother of a young cancer patient.From the very first page, this book described things that were so insightful and pertinent that I was sure John Green must have been a survivor.  Cancer Perks, the one true wish, the hatred of being singled out and stared at, experimental treatments, relapse, hospice, funerals with tiny coffins, broken and resilient and financially devastated parents ... those things, plus many more, are all really part of this lifestyle, and many of us meet in real or virtual support groups.I avoided the book for a long time because I want ready. When I finally reached that point, I didn't regret it at all.Green absolutely did not disappoint."
4," This book is beautifully written. The writing is eloquent apart from the profanities. I love the allusions to classic literature and poetry. The characters are very well developed and I felt that the characters were very similar to me and my best friend. The ending doesn't leave you mourning or sad; it has closure. It is complete. John Greene writes and develops ideas about life and what a real hero is. Honestly, I can't wait to got back through this book and analyze it. There are so many ideas that lie within his literary devices. I know I already said it was beautiful, but that's the best word to describe it. It is all around beautiful. I recommend that everyone read this, but in order to Really enjoy and take in the meaning, you have to have an appreciation for classic literature. On there surface level there is much to be had, but underneath there is so much more."
5, A great book. A book that will get young people to read and want to read more. I think it makes being kind of geeky cool.
4, Love love love this story!! It's so much better than the movie....of course. I would recommend this to everyone! Awesome!
5," This book definitely tugged at my heart strings. I cried like a baby. I absolutely loved it, most definitely a MUST read."

4, Such a great book to give insight into the thoughts of young people going through a tragic time. What a wonderful read!!!
5, Fresh approach to an age old dilemma.  Portrays correctly a few of the daily struggles with cancer. Could not be fiction.
5, The author nails it on teenage angst. It brought back so many memories. (I'm 35) A great book you won't want to put down.

2," This book may start slow and be a bit depressing, but the end makes up for it. It is so touching, I couldn't put it down."
5, Any book that can make me laugh and cry has done it's job. Well done John Green! I will be checking out your other books.
5, This was a great book and you will most likely cry and and laugh at the same time while reading definitely worth reading!
5, absolutely loved this book! You will NOT regret reading this! I totally recommend this book! It is amazingly wonderful!
5," As an adult male I can easily say this book has universal acclaim. It's deeply emotional, powerful and perfectly written."
5, am  a Hospice volunteer.  Everyone faces death differently.  This was a good inside look into what patients go through.
5,"ncredible book!  It is very well written, never cheesy, funny, but heartbreaking.  I loved it and didn't want it to end."
5, love this book because it has changed my mood and point in view in everything. For I have one had a brain tumor which is a kind of cancer but I did live through I don't know how or why but then I got this book and read it and it's opened up a new world for me. while reading this when Gus had told Hazel he was dying I my self just found out one of my best friend was on life support from a brain tumor and she yet died that day also and she was reading this brook too and was in the middle of it when she had passed she actually read this book many times for it helped her get by. My brothers son died from leukemia a year ago. so this book helps me in many ways it is now and forever my favorite book and I'm sure I will be reading in many more times. I also love the movie. I've only seen the movie once but I am going to buy it and watch it over and over again I know it.
5," bought this for two reasons: 1) a friend recommended it to me for my daughter (16) and me to read and 2) i had a gift card, so I thought 'what the hell'. I had no interest in it before that recommendation (movie didn't even interest me). it captured my attention immediately, but was not one of  those books that I just couldn't put down. I ended up taking several days to read it, and I am a voracious reader, in which I can devour a 500+ page book in less than a day. not to say the book wasn't good, because I think it was very well written and the humor scattered throughout the book definitely helped. although i have not encountered teenagers with the level of intellect and wit Hazel and Augustus show, it was not so over the top to make them seem like they couldn't be real teenagers. the book gave me a new perspective to think about in regards to life and cancer."
5," don't have a single negative thing to say about this. It blew me away. Rarely ever is a person so profoundly affected by a book. I am the same age as Hazel in the novel and connected with her in an instant. I just LOVED this book. Seriously, it was fantastic.Its a novel that I have become quite possessive of. Its the kind of book that never truly leaves you and it doesn't really change yo u because it becomes a part of you.Even after you finish the book, it will remain imprinted on your brain. It is comical, dramatic, romantic, a tad cynical and sarcastic in a refreshing way. I love to read, its literally all I do and this book is by far my favorite. It beat the classic Pride and Prejudice, it was a breath of fresh air in the Young Adult genre. Excellent, brilliant, fantastic. Don't hesitate to buy it (I have it on Kindle and hardcover)."
2," As a sixty-four year old  woman and cancer survivor, I really didn't think I wanted to read a youth market book about a 16 year-old girl who is herself dying of cancer and how she falls in love with a 17 year-old boy in her support group.  No. Way.  But for some reason or whatever, as she would say, when a friend of mine - also in my age group - said she had loved the book, I thought I would try it. Well, I couldn't get my nose out of it.  Loved the characters.  Loved the voice of the young girl, Hazel. Not a maudlin voice at all.  Hazel is ferociously honest and clear-eyed, bright and quirky.  She reminded me of myself at that age in her idealism, and I felt an instant kinship with her -- and not because of the cancer.  I'd like to think I was half as bright and vibrant as Hazel.  Thoroughly loved this book and highly recommend it to anyone."
5," This is one of the best books that I've read in a long time. It is the story, of two teens, Hazel Grace Lancaster and Augustus (Gus) Waters who meet at a cancer support group meeting,and fall in love even though they are facing death. The story is narrated by Hazel Grace with beautiful insights into the thoughts of these young people about their lives, the people around them (their parents), the world and death. John Green truly captures the emotion, the joy and pain of their world and how they deal with these issues. The story leaves the reader with many thoughts to contemplate. I highly recommend this read. The movie is also very good and stays very true to the book.The title is from Shakespeare's, Julius Caesar (I, ii, 140-141)Cassius:The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,But in ourselves, that we are underlings."
5,"t's just that: OK. John Green sucks tremendously at creating characters. As others have noted, he is unable to give them individual personalities. They all talk the same way. They use the same phrases. They're all witty, sarcastic, dry-humored. They're all John Green under various pseudonymns, and that, my friends, is one of the hallmarks of Bad Writing. There are no teenagers on planet earth who speak the way Hazel and Gus speak. Green also stinks rather badly at trying to write as a teenage girl. The whole lack of believable character development leaves you not really caring one way or another who lives or dies in this story. I didn't cry at any point in the story. This is not a book I'd recommend nor one that I will read again. It only gets three stars for being a mediocre, unrealistic, teen love story (which is what most people want in a teen love story)."
5," had to read this book for a YA Literature class and I'll have to say it was not one of my favorites. First things first: this is a plot-driven book. If you are a fan of character-led stories (books with memorable characters you'll remember for years to come), do not read it. Due to the poor character development, I never felt like I really knew the characters and therefore, I could not take the love story seriously. If not for the fast-moving plot, the cranky author character, or the fact that I had to read this for class, I'm not sure if I would have finished it. That said, if you are into fluffy love stories with a bit of awkward, unusual, and tragedy, pick it up, but if you are aspiring for a impacting love story with characters you'll remember forever, leave it on the shelf. It was written in a fun way, but even good writing cannot save flat characters."
3," This was an incredible book that I may have never read had it not been for the movie. I'm into details so I love how books go into further detail than the movie versions. I love the romance, and hate Cancer but I would highly recommend this book because it makes one realize that everyone deserves to have that once in a lifetime kind of true love, whether or not they have a hamartia (a fatal flaw or something that would normally be considered a dealbreaker in the dating world). It also makes you appreciate your life that much more, and helps teach the lesson to not judge a book by the cover (Ex- if one is an alcoholic or recluse- what are the underlying reasons?) I personally cried more happy tears than sad ones. As is taught in the book The universe is not a wish granting factory. We must truly appreciate what and who we have in our lives."
2, Don't understand all the hype over this book. It was predictable and eerily similar to Sparks's book A Walk to Remember.
5, Good story but thought the language was a bit much for the audience. Great stories can be written without foul language.
1," The best book I have ever read. Literally brought me to tears reading it, I can't wait until I see the movie later today"
4, Not a great story I don't recommend it. If you're into third or  fourth grade reading level then this is perfect for you
5," This book was by far, the best book I have ever read. I wanted more. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone."
2," strongly recommend this book. I normally don't read romance books, but this one was different. Definitely made me cry."

5, This is literally the best book I have ever read. It's powerful. I wish it could've been longer. It really made me think
5, This book was phenomenal. It makes you reflect on the way society and oblivion determine who we are. It's worth reading.
5, Smiled and cried while reading. Cried a lot actually. Well written in every way.  I highly recommend this awesome book .
5," This is an extremely easy read; the conversational tone and instantly-loveable characters compel readers through chapter after chapter with little need to hesitate. You connect to Hazel immediately and fall in love with Augustus from the moment Hazel spots him in group.My initial reaction after crying five different times and then the entire last seven or so chapters of this book was to both love it and hate it at the same time. It offers such an honest portrayal of life - something so many of us take for granted. It's a beautiful, innocent love story of two who have nothing to lose, which makes the rawness and realness of their relationship and interaction all the more poignant.The writing style is fun and smart, witty and wise, and the story, while heartbreakingly real, leaves you satisfied, despite the finality of impending death."
